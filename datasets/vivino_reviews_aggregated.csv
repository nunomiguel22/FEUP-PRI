Perfect balance of flavor and body. Model syrah.,Called Incógnito from the time it was launched and the Syrah grape was less accepted than it is now in Alentejo, the wine is dark, dense and concentrated. It is shot through with blackberry and plum flavors that are layered with dense tannins and a perfumed aftertaste. ,Another 100% Syrah grape type from Portugal. I think this was probably their high end range as the oak profile was a league above the rest of the wines being served, very elegant oak from the nose. Content was decent, very easygoing and friendly drink. However at €60 a bottle I'd refrain from recommending my audience as the price is probably not worth it. "

The yields are very low, only one bunch per vine. Tasted this side by side with the 2015 vintage. This is eerily similar to the younger vintage and doesn't show a lot of development.

The smell that I smell today will change over the next months or years. I prefer to focusing on the history of the producer, understand the place where it's made, and how it was done. Appreciating the wine with the right food pairing and the enjoying the special moments the wine is creating is what truly connects people.    ,Maybe I got wrong match in Vivino.

Almost as old as me!:-),Not a bad way to end a fabulous dinner.  A delicious vintage port with impressive concentration and depth, so ripe, so balanced with its verve and veins of acidity. Luscious, seductive, creamy but not cloying. 1985 is not a renowned vintage but this Fonseca is exceptional. Just entering its prime drinking stage, right in between its youthful ascent and emerging maturity. Lots of life ahead. ,Rich plums and syrup on the nose.

A bit spirity on the finish to start with but this mellows quickly and becomes a wonderfully smooth and close to perfect aged vintage port. Plenty of room for further ageing too.,So young - probably 3 decades too early.  So Microsoft 1.0 released, Madonna and A-Ha had huge hits, Maggie Thatcher was England’s PM, Australia had a Prime Minister serving full term (Bob Hawke)...the old days.

Mix of dates figs raisins ,And that desert sent me to heaven ❤️❤️❤️,Smooth taste with a refined finish. Not too sweet, but fruity hints surface as it develops on the palette.,Sweet nose of raisins, spice cake and cinnamon. Mature palette with caramelised dark fruits, cloves, medicinal notes, well balanced acidity and soft tannins. Medium long soft finish. Elegant. 90,Still vibrant primary fruits.

Mature taste but still very fresh. Amazing with fine dark chocolate and 6-years parmigiano.,An absolute pleasure to drink. Fruity with raisins, cigar box and tobacco.

I really enjoy the tertiary (age) characteristics that resemble that of an aged warm climate table wine.,Smells like candy (Mon Cherry) and light wood. Soft and rich like sirup and balanced, hints of medicine. 3 days after opening softness and ballance is gone.,Quite disappointing considering its accolades and ratings. A sharp bitterness lingers on the palate, with cinnamon sugar, brown sugar and spice.,Disappointed in this initially. Not much better than a LBV. But a week later it was deep and plummy. Caramel came through. Almost as good as a true vintage year port,Wines from Portugal, June 7 - wine fair - only rating. The last Porto of the night.  Rate 3.9,Expensive but nice.....full of forest fruit, liqourice and vennel seeds notes. Alcohol is a bit too much for me.,Still tight. As to age ,Yum.

Instant hit to the nose: Caramel, dried apricots, white chocolate.... An exquisite oiliness with sublime, persistent length,World peace. An end to poverty. Eradication of infectious disease. Vintage port by the glass. I decided to tackle the last of these great 21st Century problems first, taking my Coravin to this Fonseca. Initial results were poor, with sediment passing through the vintage needle. Pouring, letting it settle and then redecanting works, but at too high a cost in wine and time. A horizontal bottle on top of a wine rack, with the Coravin applied and wine poured with just a slight tilt, worked best. Disease next 👍,Good price, good value, getting better with years passing, a very pleasing port with spicy character but good get more depth ,A real stunner - black fruit, caramel and dried fruit - absolutely perfect with cheese.

Smoth, very strong and lingers in the mouth. Incredible.,It's beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! Dried fruit on the palate, Christmas pudding, walnuts. It's very long and pleasant. Almost as old as me!:-),Silky and refined.  Needs decanting to let the alcohol blast pass by like a summer thunderstorm. Then deep, rich but refreshing licorice,blueberry compote and a touch of pebbles in a stream.  Big, but not heavy; the acidity and high alcohol retention makes it perfect for roast duck dishes or even winged game done up in red wine sauce.  Decant and drink over 2/3 days.  Definitely want go find more and revisit in like 5 years.  A real beauty.  95/96 points,Massive, concentrated and powerful, this offers lush, heady flavors of dark plum, blackberry and cherry tart, with touches of anise. Shows plenty of grip as well, with a long, rich finish of dark chocolate, toffee and cream. Very young. Best from 2040 ?? ,The potential is there. Obviously far too young, but still the deep dark, sticky fruits show through. Spicy alcohol heat, drying finish.,This is far too young to really appreciate properly but it can be drunk now. Although the nose is quite dumb, the fruit acid and tannins are pretty well integrated with a nice dollop of spice. It would just be a bit of a waste to drink now rather than in 10 or 15 years.,Deep ruby color, intense, expressive and elegant notes of ripe black fruit like blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and lovely aromas of eucalyptus and menthol mixed with tobacco leaves, dried herbs, fig, prunes, vanilla and cigar box. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. ,Excellent flavors of red stewed fruit and still quite tannic. A baby wine that can develop a lot more in bottle.,Nice nose of white pepper and blackberries with a touch of cassis. Bit heavy with out the classic lift of mint. On the palate it is very sweet with soft tannins. A slight hint of bitterness but severely lacking in acidity. Again it is just a bit too heavy and clumsy. It is not bad, but I expected more. Compared to the 2015 this is a sorry effort. 89-91p,Silky plums, very nice.,Strong fruit flavors ,Excellent straight or mixed in cocktails. Perfect with vanilla ice cream too,What a find! Instant hit to the nose: Caramel, dried apricots, white chocolate.... An exquisite oiliness with sublime, persistent length,This is drinking well in 2017, but still a lot of alcohol heat. I'd like to see 5 more years on this and it should be seductively rich. Already deep fruit and chocolate.,Founded in 1822 and still managed by successive generations of the Guimaraens family. This is something special and should be set down for many years. I opened this bottle early to celebrate my Mom’s 86th birthday, which was a very special occasion. Dark purple with complex aromas of berry & currants with notes of dry herbs. On the palate lots of rich dark berry flavors, with cedar, pepper and mineral at the core. Dense tannins, lingering ending with a statement. Very nice!,Good price, good value, getting better with years passing, a very pleasing port with spicy character but good get more depth ,Yum.  Caramel and nuttiness that just grabs your attention and captivates you through the long finish.  Great after a long day of travel.  Woof!,Nice bottle swap by the folks at Yiannis Wine Shop.

Enjoyable wine and as with a lot of Portuguese wines, you are getting great value for money. Powerful wine, tannins are smooth.  Cheers and happy Friday 🍷🍷,Solid winter red. At first (after less than 20' decanting) the nose was shy and dominated by the oak, the palate quite green (tomato leaf, eucalyptus). But after ~60' of decanting, it opened up to more fruity and complex aromas of mulberry, ripe plum, leather and cigar box. It also softened up to a very balanced palate and plush mouthfeel. ,Dark cherry in colour. Really stood out colour wise. Smelt cherry, a little oak. Tasted cherry, mild tobacco, had a little spice on the aftertaste, tannins were good balanced by decanting and it was very good with beef brisket. Not normally a blend fan but this was enjoyable and reasonably priced.,At first I wasn’t quite impressed, as her nose seems to be a bit too subtle. As time goes by, her initial vegetal nose of tomato turns into red fruit, and predominantly sweet spice, such as cinnamon. The hue is purplish, and it is evidently full-bodied. On the palate, she is thick,  velvety, with appropriate acidity that makes her round and a long finish. A fine wine though not my favourite of the night.,Dark color with a pleasant fruit taste. Bold in flavor that is pleasing…nice quality taste for price range. Saad recommended ,Beautiful Douro from Casa Ferreirinha. Great blend of touriga Franca, touriga nacional and tinta Roriz. "

69734,"Wowza had this sitting in the house for a few years and just gave it an airing. Sumptuous wine earthy notes but velvety smooth dark fruit. Can’t see how anyone could dislike a portugese triumph ,🍷 In the glass, bloodstone ruby red   👃 In the sniffy sniff, earthy and ashy with summer fruits and notes of festive spices, cherries, red currents and mince pies with traces of oak   👅 In the mouth, very spicy with tonnes of dried fruits and packed with tannns... Blueberries, currents, raisins and glacier cherries, with licorice, star anise and oak   🥂 This port is totally outstanding, but feels just a tad unbalanced... It may be better if opened in another year or two...,Terra Feita 2001 from Taylor. A real treat! Sumptuous wine, loaded with fig, dates, sweet earth and beautiful rich extract of spice, grape jam and compote.   Lasted  (unfortunately) 2 days. A note to self: order a case!  Happy Christmas Hannukah and new year everyone!,Opened w. Steve Standbridge a couple of weeks ago & still going strong, a SQVP from the Pinhão Valley.  Deep ruby. Pronounced aroma intensity w. black cherry jam, prune, baked blackcurrant, crème de mure & violet. Black pepper, kirsch & dried dark flowers. Developing w. a slightly hot spirity note & chilli pepper.  Sweet. Rich, soft & floral. Perfumed violet, black cherry, crème de violette, damson jam & blackberry cream. High alc, full body, m+ acid, m(-) tannins & a touch of chocolate on the m+ finish.,Rich port, great deep rich fruits and silky tannins.,Great QPR for a single quinta vintage port. Not from a declared vintage year so a great way to get to taste the dense dark opulent blackberry & cassis fruit you only get in true vintage port but without breaking the bank!  At 18 years old still has plenty of longevity & drinking beautifully now.  Be warned this stunning port throws a heck of a lot of sediment & requires careful decanting.,Apologies for the short notes.  Found this, like the Vargelles 2004, to be quite hot on the alcohol for a wine of this age and status. Raisin and ripe red fruit flavours abound, and, like it's younger brother, lacks tertiary character.,Its hard to believe that this fruit is 17 years since harvest - it’s massively intense with a muscular and indulgent character.  Masses of dried figs and sticky burnt sugar coat the mulberry and damson fruit beautifully.  Opulent and concentrated but not tame - this is quite a wild, brash glass of port wearing it’s gritty, sweet earthy tannins on it’s sleeve.  The alcohol was a little off-kilter on day one, but after mellowing in a decanter overnight it’s now more in tune with the spice and fruit. 4.2⭐️ 👏,For 18 months this scan has been hiding on Vivino waiting for me to rediscover it. Today I did thanks to a review of a different Taylor's Port. This was served by @[1|6118632|Andy B] at the end of an excellent evening and his TN (which I've just read) is much more useful than my scribbled note which is - Very deep dark purple. Gorgeous nose  of violets, liqourice, prune & Xmas cake. Full body, long slightly spicy finish. Still a baby, very fresh. 4⭐,Bought this for my Brothers Birthday after a bit of guidance from the staff at Majestic. Deep dark fruit flavours like plums, damsons, raisons and black cherries...perfect with mature cheeses and a bit of blue smelly Stilton. Seriously full in flavour, very jammy, very intense, very more-ish. Not a bad gift if I don’t say so myself 😀,Classic and very good now. But, will probably get much better if hold for the future,Those Chocolate candies with the booze injected inside. Rum? And whisky, too. And caramel.  After awhile I realised there was very little fruit in this one. A bit one dimensional, but tasty for the sweet tooth. ,Dark purplish-red, powerful dark fruit nose with earthy and smoky notes, tannin-rich mouthful of fruit flavours giving way to dark chocolate and fig during the prolonged finish. More structured than the Vargellas SQVP, but opens nicely and well worth trying.,Did not impress me. Seemed too closed to make a real impression. Lack of power, especially in the taste, which disappeared almost before it even began.,Nice, smooth, mature - a bit too much alcohol in the finish"

Very well integrated wood in general, on the fruitier side; but well rounded and full bodied. Bit of red fruit and strong vanilla. Excellent.,This is a good wine but absolutely not my taste... aromas reminded me of artificial red fruit bubblegum. Velvety mouthfeel, smooth tannins and a rather long finish. Reading the other descriptions here makes me wonder if I grabed a faulty bottle... ,100% trincadeira, very nice and balanced, with a twist of licorice ,Good with parmeggiano. ,Balanced, simple at the noise and start, but explode at the end in the mouth. Liked the complexity and mineral,I'm in a lucky week. Another great wine. 100% trincadeira, typical Portuguese varietal. Dark fruits in nose, blackberries, plums, raspberries, very aromatic.

At first synthetic pineapple candy but with some air the vanilla spices take over. Bitter and buttery.  (Only 2 months of wood used on the chardonnay)   Medium plus body with good intensity. Acidity is beautifully integrated with the spices of the wood what gives a sparkling after taste.

74701,"Ripe blackberry, palate is mild,Color: dark red with a black center Nose: thyme, red fruit On the palate: black currant, cherries, spices. Quite interesting red wine.,Confusing as their website indicates that their AB monocasta would be 100% AB yet the back label seems to say this was made ""mainly"" from AB. Still, it's a decent, drinkable product. Has more personality on the nose (taco shell and squid ink, anyone?) than on the palate where I find a freshness that is a bit too cleansing and a tannin that is on the young side (a 2014 drinking in 2016; 12 months in small oak barrels; ageing potential according to the label of up to 7 years). 14.5% abv.,Ripe dark berries with herbs,  coffee and liquorice.

Apples and pears on the nose, that is really a rather evocative scent and pungent at the same time.   Light to medium in body, light acidity and a whole lotta refreshment.   Would recommend to anyone!,An unctuous sipper not too dissimilar to a crisp Alvarinho or the better known Albariño out of Rias Baixas. Full bouquet nose, refreshing zesty notes with a honey kick. The flavours get more interesting with each mouthful. Versatile enough to match well with most things, but a meaty fish (maybe monkfish) would be dreamy. Will certainly re-order.

75606,"Sour cherry, black and red currants on the nose. Mild black fruit and oak flavours with a long smooth finish with mild tannins. ,I’m not usually drawn to wines at 15% alcohol, however this is a finely balanced, drop with beautifully integrated flavours. Sour cherry, a little tobacco, prunes, aged in oak, and yet the alcohol never overpowers. I reckon Malbec fans would rejoice.   Stands up really well with spicy food. Exceptional for the price. ,Aged in French oak for 12 months this tantalising blend of Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez and Trincadeira is a little gem with many indulgent qualities. Deep ruby in colour it announces itself to your palate with a fanfare - spiced plums, cherries & blackberries - silky smooth and soft tannins but my word - they appear with a headlong rush! Decent tannins, the finish is rewarding if a little peppery. Summary: Maybe a tad overwhelming at first, if you can get past that point it’s a heartwarming treat.,Good red wine with acidic and dry finish, oak and dark fruit for an amazing reserve from 2016 of the Carmin house! ,Same review , same taste,Good at that price range. But I’ve had five beers and a couple of g&t s so who am I to judge. ,Very good wine dark colours and good value ,Can’t go wrong with an Aragonez Trincadeira combo. Really rich and tanniny. Great with meats but also with cheese. Vinos from the Alentejo easily my favourites from Portugal ,Smoke and leather balance mildly to develop a smooth no nonsense Wednesday night red. A little tobacco, typical of the region, pairs well with lamb or game. Cassis and vanilla notes at the end. ,Oak flavor, nice balanced for meals, reasonable pricing ,Better than expected with fresh cherries and raspberries on the nose, definitely bathe Reserva is bolder and easy to drink. It lacks complexity and doesn’t evolve along the tasting but still pleasant. Overall a decent blend within regional typicité. Cheers! ,A bit on the sweet side but otherwise an acceptable wine.  Not a heavy or strong wine despite 14.5% alcohol. ,3.25 Nice every day bottle, bit better that the price sugested. Black currant, red currant, forest floor and hints of oak. ,Smoke, deep, well balanced and a really good wine. ,Smooth, touch of spices, medium to long finish. Great with chocolate deserts."

The wine itself still had some fruits and a bit of  toasted almond (!!!) ,Also had this by the glass at the Garrafeira Nacional in Lisbon. Like the Vega-Sicilia, this is also more than special. Complex and intense nose of toasty oak, cherries, sugar kane, spices, grass and herbaceous notes. Great body on it, smooth and elegant. And a great twist on the palate.

Elegant and balanced with notes of dark cherry, prune, balsamic, eucalyptus, and dried figs. A whiff of fallen leaves tingles the nose. A voluptuous, sensual feel caresses the mouth. Paired with Gouda cheese last night. Yup, I drank this very young and it will be at a good age in 5-8 years and will last for 30. But (1) this is a super vintage year, and (2) I’m a geezer who can’t wait!,Typically for 2003 this is a voluptuous port, relatively forward for its age. Dense, with black cherry, prune, fig and mocha. The palate is smooth and spicy, rapidly developing more savoury tobacco, tar, anise. It is not overly sweet or acidic. It doesn’t have the magical combination of intensity and complexity that characterise the best vintage ports, and like many 2003s I wouldn’t keep it indefinitely. I’m not sure it will improve; it is great to drink now. 4*+. "

I was quite impressed  by its slow-motion opening up. It is dense, opaque and runs the risk of not being polished if does not rest long enough in bottle. A wine for Autumn.  Aromas of very ripe black forest fruits, violettes. A subtle note of vanilla and heavy on oak-like tertiary notes, including smoke. In mouth, part of this intense 'crianza' is passed and pending to be polished. Bur all in all, this 2010 presents good refinement. Interesting. Elegant.,David Baverstock and Luís Patrão…art in the labels…Esporao. Wine in glass reviles deep ruby colour. Swirling the wine in glass…scent reviles black fruit, wet stone, vanilla and spicy aromas with medium minus intensity. In mouth It is robust and very well-structured…I got surprised…positively. It is dry wine with medium plus acidity and tannins structure. It has medium plus body and medium finish.  It is very good wine. Serve it with barbeque meat. One additional note: 1+ hour decant."

With distinct minerals,  discreete lemon acidity and oak. The fruit is very fresh with yellow apples, apricot and peach.   The taste is fresh, but with significant oak. Lemon, yellow apples. It's a bit flatter than the nose, otherwise the score would be higher. This is 4.1.  I see other reviews mentioning California style, but this sends me to South Africa: Stellenbosch   Great with a shellfish lasagna. ,Short notes: oak and butter galore, malolactic fermentation defined. Hate it, love it, I’m firmly in the camp of “use it sparingly” and this completely overdoes it imho. Otherwise decent tropical backbone and good balance with a sharp lime finish. ,Have never had this style before; it seemed like a nice wine, but simple to an oaky Chardonnay which isn’t really my style.  Deep gold color, full bodied. Nose of butter, honeysuckle, lemon, and mango. A creamy feel on the palate with pear and more tropical flavors as well as pie crust mid palate.  Rich finish.

Such a unique red blend from southern Portugal. What a nice surprise. ,Very fruity as you’d expect from the grape varieties. No real complexity just an easy drinking quaffable Wine. ,The Shiraz balances the more tart varietals to give a wine that punches well above it’s weight considering the price range. ,Lighter, with a very slight acidic tannin that will definitely tamp down with a little time.  Cherry note, but not too strong and a mild finish.  ,Fruity and light, lacks complexity but very good anyway,Final de baunilha .

1105380,"Alicante Bouschet is the 🍇 ( cornerstone of south 🇵🇹 Alentejo).  Beauty grape. Makes a dark coloured wine though the fruits are more in the red spectrum on the palate  Nose is Christmas cake , tobacco  and a dark Smokey leathery note underneath.  Palate has good depth to the stormy black raspberry with a balsamic / herbal kind of note  as it gets to its long dedicated finish.  Impressed enough to move up the ladder and demolish the next level Alicante .  Stay tuned.   🇵🇹 🍇 discoveries ✅.  Though 😃 here,Deep concentrated ruby red in color.

Complex earthy aromas,If S (syrah) was bombastic, how do I call this? Tremendous powerful, in a way like the black wines of cahors, but with other aromas offcourse.

Tasted it blindly and what a pleasure. Dark ripe fruit in the nose and on the palate are combined with a freshness of the acidity but also some pepper touches to make give it quite some body. The tannins are present but elegant and soft. The finish is long lingering and again very fresh to make this a heavy but summery wine. Top quality though it comes with a price (+€30). If I hadn't know the price, it would have received 4,5*,The wine was decanted for 2 hours and a little solids...were filtered out. Yummy big fruit and succulent flavours.  I was in Portugal 40 years ago and drank wubbish. Today has enlightened me in pursuit of grapes I can't pronounce."

An elegant, well structured wine and for that it receives 4 stars. I was disappointed with the strength of the flavour, especially with the Syrah blend. Defiantly needs some cheese to bring the wine to life. For the price, I won’t be going back. ,Pretty much the same as the 2014 I've tasted in Belgium, just before travelling to Portugal, but with less tannin dominance. What's more, with the dish (meat in a cabbage leaf with beetroot sauce) it was superb.,4⭐ for this Alentejo red wine. Extraordinary aroma focused on red fruits and some flowers.

I was very curious when was opening the bottle as price was good one. But to the point. Plummy colour on the glass. Nose? O my gosh, the nose is full of fruits of blackberry, cherry, blackcurrant, plum and blueberry. Not expected such palette of fruity smells combined with oak, vanilla and chocolate additionally.

Deep dark cherry, dried fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, leather, and earth. More than a tad of tannins. Definitely a meat-paired accompaniment. Bought on sale in a northern Portugal grocery store for under 10 €. ,The first smell was of damp socks. Some toasted notes, slightly peppery, something like the stone of plum or cherry.

1162976,"Finale of the tasting at Quinta de Nápoles in Douro. Vintage port can only age in barrels for 2yrs unlike tawny port, so the rest is about what happens in the bottle. Infinitely reasonably priced vs non-fortified wine.  Nose: reductive nose. Great oxidative mushroom contrasts with prune. Marshmallow finish.  Palate: nice tension between the sweetness of concentrated fig, quince+caramelised orange and an acidity that bites. Smooth tannins. This results in an overall elegant, lingering finish.,91/100 Notes of cherry, tobacco, pepper, and leather. It smells like a wonderfully aged Pinot Noir. On the palate this is a little more elegant. There are flavors of nuttiness and toffee on the finish. The alcohol sticks a little more with this wine. Firm tannins. ,Wow, what an elegant sweet wine! Full of hazelnut, toffee and a certain je-ne-sais-quoi. Long lasting finish. 10x better than the 1978 we had 2 days later.,1982 vintage, Raisin, blackberry, blueberry, cinnamon, thyme, cranberry, nutmeg, fresh cut roses on the nose, with caramel, sea salt, molasses, honey, fig, chocolate syrup, cherry, and minerals on the palette. Really nice port that is drinking well.,1982 - peppery, green and timut pepper, leather, tobacco, reminds of some aged earthy Pinot noir ,just wow!  such finesse and depth in this port.,This is an interesting vintage wine from Niepoort; whilst I still prefer the 1987 (despite its nearly excessive volatile acidity (and let’s not even begin to speak about the 1985)), there is no shortage of interesting aspects to enjoy about this wine: Mint, eucalyptus, a strong medicinal character, and an enjoyable cranberry flavour greet the palate and last for a considerable amount of time on the palate. Definitely worth trying!,Cherries, almonds. Good acidity, strawberries and rhubarb, dynamic and very good. 91 points ,Not to sweet with oaky, smoky notes. ,Clear medium tawny (Amber, golden, honey) colour.

This will definitely be one of my to go to ports from now on.,Should have drunk it earlier....,Speechless The nose is luscious with figs, raisins, burnt almonds that leads to a sumptuous palate with lashings of treacle, licorice, raisins and figs with burnt caramel. The back is amazingly complex with vanilla, oak and a sublime aniseed finish. Class,5 stars for ultimate potential, probably more like 3.5-4 for drinking right now, but no surprises there. This will be magnificent. Right now it's a little disjointed; you have the tannins, the fruit, the heat but they hit you separately rather than melding together seamlessly the way they will with another 20/30/40 years in the bottle. Fun to taste a port this good this young, but wouldn't do it as a matter of course!,Lunch at Devin By Sephi.  Super concentrated nose bursting of dark ripe fruit, cassis, tobacco, sigarbox, roasted almond, cedar wood, raisins and dried figs.

Outstanding.  4.6🌟,4.6. Clear, inky purple. Clean, medium plus intensity aroma of blackberry, plum, blueberry, mocha, orange zest, vanilla.

Outstanding. ,Dry raisins and sumptuous vanilla flavors that warm the palate with spicy oakiness.,I know it's young, but I was impatient to try one of these ""fabled"" 2011s, so I drank this with friends over a period of a couple of days. Like an unfolding ballet this was many different drinks over time - starting with blackcurrant, then moving towards ""grape brandy"", it then gained an edge and lost some fruit, but a few hours later the fruit was back, blackberries this time, and the finish got longer. Right now this is simply lovely - in 20 years time this could well be a classic.,Rating: 4.1. Followed the Château Cheval Blanc with this hearty 30 year old Niepoort port. Dark, full bodied and smooth with a limited 19% ABV. Expressing aromas to gig, rhubarb, pomegranate, dates and apricots with a tantalizingly sweet array of flavors to plums,black cherry, nutmeg, vanilla, Belgian dark chocolate and a hint of espresso at its end. Simple, yet cloyingly satisfying. Interesting port; will have again! ,Still very young but what surprised me was the purity and power of fruits.

Wine is sweet with medium+ acidity & tannin, high alcohol, full body, pronounced flavor intensity & a long finish. Flavors are same as nose. This port is outstanding with potential for further aging.,Wow! Of the 4 bottles of this Niepoort vintage I’ve opened, this is by far the most impressive and remarkably different than the others: Dark, intense and with rapier-like tannins (I even think of some Taylor’s character, here, but even more generous in the best ways of the Niepoort style); with sweet cherry resolve on the finish, I could only wonder what wine this would have been in 10-15 more years...clearly a (delicious) mistake to have opened at this stage.,Opaque and full bodied. Creme de cassis, marzipan, winter spice, bitter cocoa, mocha, crushed violets with granite schist minerality. More floral and fruity on the nose with more minerality showing on the palate. Intense and unctuous with a long silky finish and mouthfeel. Already delicious at this young age. Another 20 years should smoothen out its rough edges. Yummy.,Speechless The nose is luscious with figs, raisins, burnt almonds that leads to a sumptuous palate with lashings of treacle, licorice, raisins and figs with burnt caramel. The back is amazingly complex with vanilla, oak and a sublime aniseed finish. Class,I have not had a vintage port for a while and by that point of the lunch, we were quite toast... my somm friend thought it would be fun to cut the neck of the bottles with the classic port tongs and a blow torch to warm it up. It worked and came out clean! 5 stars service and delivery. To be honest, by that point I cannot remember the full taste profile of the wine, but I remember liking it... a lunch to remember ,Absolutely amazing port at niepoort winery👌,Excellent port with dark fruit as well as fig/prune undertones. This will definitely be one of my to go to ports from now on.,2003 - ripe fruits notes, very charming boy for a warm vintage, peperry, jammy red fruits, intense  but still elegant and has  some finesse,4,4 stars. At the end of a marathonic blind taste, I was not in condition anymore to take notes on this 33 years old Port.  Nevertheless, the classiness of it was stunningly obvious, with a top notch lushness, that is hard to describe in terms of its outstanding texture, that was mindblowing in conjunction with fresh elegant inky compote berry fruit, plum, fig, liquorice & prunes and a whole load of lovely smooth spices. Acidity easily caught up the sweetness, to make this a balanced luscious gem.,Superbly better than the fantastic 82 to a more modern wine, acidity, fruit and everything hangs together in this 32-year-old wine - drink it if you find it! I'm reluctant to use the word umami but there is a almost impossible intangible flavor.,93/100 It smells dark and dense, this vintage is incredibly young for its age. Notes of dark plum, black cherry, mocha, and pepper. This is very dense and the tannins are still fierce. There is a great feeling of orange peel acidity and intensity.

Vintage port can only age in barrels for 2yrs unlike tawny port, so the rest is about what happens in the bottle. Infinitely reasonably priced vs non-fortified wine.  Nose: reductive nose. Great oxidative mushroom contrasts with prune. Marshmallow finish.  Palate: nice tension between the sweetness of concentrated fig, quince+caramelised orange and an acidity that bites. Smooth tannins. This results in an overall elegant, lingering finish.,Wow, what an elegant sweet wine! Full of hazelnut, toffee and a certain je-ne-sais-quoi. Long lasting finish. 10x better than the 1978 we had 2 days later.,My first Porto in magnum. Very impressive. 4.6,4.3. Oohhh this is tasty!  Very young still -- this has a couple decades to maturity -- but already delicious. The nose has raspberry jam, prune, chocolate covered raisins, fig, and licorice.  The palate is intense, basically matching the nose, but adds blueberry compote. Moderate sweetness, but also medium+ acidity. Intense and delicious. ,I don’t drink much ports/dessert wines, but I got to admit this is a very good wine. It’s not overly sweet, honey, oxidized yet with the complexity. Great intensity on the palate and it just lingers. The lingering finish is crazy. Everyone who doesn’t drink port should drink this. ,Fantastic Wine!  Already in a good drinking window.

I’m very excited to try another one in about years from now. ,Tasting at Niepoort cellars in Vila Nova de Gaia in Porto. 2000 was apparently a great vintage for Niepoort, and this showed in the intensity of the flavours. From 60+yr vines from the typical Douro schist soil of Vinha da Pisca, Pinhão+Ferrão.  Nose: savoury and intense caramel+fried fig. Some nice peppery notes.  Palate: continuation of the nose in a quite full body: intense fig bomb followed by oxidative notes of soy sauce/yolk. Long umami finish.,Fabulous!!!! Massive wine, not showing its age. Dark color. Sweet and intense. Doesn’t let go. My favorite port maker. It has a distinctive dusty aroma to it. ,And again I can only give 5 stars. Don't understand want to understand why this wine was not well received by my regular friends. I didn't care because this port is just gross. Very personality and spicy. Limitlessly long.

1163127,"Tried at a tasting & remembered it as better than it was when we opened it. Sadly I can't remember too much about it now except that it was fruitier and stronger than I prefer.

Elder berries and barks, slightly vegetal nose. Split palate, a lot of alcohol and sugar, tannins are a bit green.,Cassis and pure. Very heavy on the pallet. Surely one the greats. Needs another xxx years. Can't go wrong with this,This wine has great potential although is much too young now. ,Nice port. Sweetness to it.  Thicker and dark color. No real spiciness to it which I miss. ,The best of three 2015 vintage ports tasted in February. These recently bottled wines were all delightfully fruity and approachable, it would be no crime to open a bottle now. Typically for the vintage this Noval has a wonderfully floral nose. Abundant blackcurrant and black cherry fruit. The palate is dense and warm, spicier than the others tasted.

Amazing concentration of fruit, powerful yet fresh. The balance here is amazing: alcohol, sugar, or tannins don't stick out. This is deliciously ,There is potential here! Still young, but already great! The tannins are still a bit rough but will well develop with time. Not too much sweetness and good acidity. Great finish that will become a 5/5 in few years in my opinion! Cheers 🍷,One of the best young Port’s I have ever tasted. So rich, lovely blackberries and lots of tannins. Beautiful wine. And will last for the next 40-50 years. 🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷,Wait! This wine will be brilliant, but only if we wait...opening bottles of this now can be equated with nothing less than oenological infanticide. Wait!,Ok, pretty much impossible to swallow at this stage, but what a wine this will be. Just wow,This beautifully perfumed wine has all the tannins that will allow it to age gracefully over many decades. It offers rich wild berries, dark plum skin, orange blossom,licorice and dried lavender - infused blueberries and great structure that will support that aging. A mineral undertow accentuates the elegance. Surprisingly brooding, with an cocoa- powder lifted finale and a pleasant freshness on the aftertaste!  ,TOP DOG PORT  Very young at this moment!

A bit of grassiness adds depth, but I don't think it needs it.,That was stunning, floral, fresh, delicate, well balanced with a fine structure and pure fruit. ,Rich, full, complex and very long lasting taste.,2004 was relatively dry and cool in the Douro. Noval declared, while Symington and Fladgate produced some top end single Quinta wines. This is very densely coloured, with a garnet rim. Black fruit and violet on the nose, slightly medicinal. The palate is sweet, concentrated and tannic. Feels younger than 16 years. Stony, earthy minerals; liqourice and chocolate. Delicious, impressive, validates Noval's decision to make a vintage port. Keep for now; open 2025 onwards. ,One of my favorite port houses. This one is magnificent.   So many layers of aromas to discover. What I like is the vinous style, it is not as sweet as others. It has some edge.,Pure elder berries. Maybe a bit too simple, but very drinkable! Fine acidity, present but not overwhelming tannins, melted sugar-alcohol balance.,Spice, smoky, meat. Leather. Sweet spice. Not the pallet weight of the 2007 but so complex and delicious. A perfect port from Noval. Thanks ,Dulst 25y #10 Closing time!  What is better than a good tradition to close a tasting than a good and well aged Port?  Well good traditions never disappoint. This 2004 is great to end a exceptional tasting. The end of the tasting and begin of the midnight snack with a great cheese platter.   Typical port nose with dried raisins. The palate is fine and elegant with black cherries, dried raisins, orange zest, subtle vanilla and wood, spices and very fine body. Also with a long lasting finish!  Rate 4,0⭐️,[Dulst 25 years conclusion] You can’t go wrong with fine, mature vintage port. This one is basically still an infant at 15 so unsurprisingly very fresh and a perfect pairing with some ripe cheeses. Earthy nose with mint, eucalyptus and blueberry followed by a palate with pleasantly contained acidity, fine acidity, characterful tannines, pepper, spices and raisins. 4.2 ,A matured vintage port, a cork in 1’000 pieces... Tar, earth and leather meet raisin, jam and dried red fruit. Dry, concentrated, surprisingly fresh, but not as juicy as expected. Present alcohol on the palate, kind of burning. Elegant style, but this is not an easy quaffer. Complex yet demanding! Not fully convinced if the bottle wasn’t slightly faulty... 4⭐️ anyway! ,Rich, full, complex and very long lasting taste.,Dark ruby colour.  On the nose plums, chocolate, mandarin orange blossoms and baking spices.  On the palate full bodied with chewy tannins, sweet, fresh fruit on the mid palate and a long sweet plum finish.

Almost 5.,Someone has to do the job #winelover - taste of the 2013 Noval Vintage only 1200 cases to be released - Pure, class and elegant but a bit more concentrated and muscular than the 2012 - another great port to store for a few years ,1,200 cases made. This was a terrible vintage for port, and Noval were one of the few big houses to declare a vintage. Very different to the 2011 and needs more time.   Much spicer and more oaky than the 2011. Blueberry, cinnamon, clove, char, prune jam, raisin, blackberry, cherry. Black currant and raspberry jam. Softer than the 2011, lacks the power and intensity. ,I’ve been looking for the chance to sample a young vintage port. This 2013 proved softer and easier to drink than I imagined.  Dense purple. Rich black fruit, blackberry, black cherry and prune, with cinnamon and clove spice. It’s a little floral at this age. The sweetness, acidity, tannins and alcohol vie for supremacy. Painfully young, but still enjoyable. I could imagine trying this with roast beef, or a bittersweet dark chocolate tart.  Enomatic sample at Hedonism, London.,Ok, pretty much impossible to swallow at this stage, but what a wine this will be. Just wow,Elegant yet complex, with juicy currants, licorice, spice and cedar. The only fault here is that I opened this too early. This will evolve over time and become even better.,Still too dominated by a sharp spiciness which will settle over time.  But nonetheless appealing and softened by lovely sweet red fruit.  Doesn’t feel like a strong vintage.  But I wouldn’t say no if you offered me a glass!,👁 deep Ruby  👃🏻 burnt, overcooked, jammy black fruit, particularly plum.  👅 sweet, with between 100–1 20 g/L residual sugar, 20% alcohol, very high acid, lots of soft, plush tannins.   Decadently rich black fruit. Delicious. ,Deep ruby with purple rim. Blackberry, raisin, prune, leather, ginger, orange peel, vanilla, licorice, molasses, pepper, coffee. Med+ finish with the cocoa tones and a bit bitterness on the palate. Bold, med+ tannin, offdry. Unfiltered, lots of sediments & skins. Still vibrant, need more years. 4.2.,Well developed with deep flavours, moderate tannins and a long finish,Unlike restrained 2014, this one is a bit more open, but still too young. The nose is a bit funky, the black fruits are bruised and oxidated. The palate is more friendly then 2014, but still not impressive. ,Not particularly my taste. Very perfumed palate and nose. Moderately sweet and soft alcohol. Elegant though. ,Not ready to drink now, so aggressive & young,Concentration and dense. Some tertiary character. A bit meaty. Big tannins. ,Very cherry and cocoa. Bomb in mouth with loads of tannins, intensely sweet and highly alcoholic. A very young porto vintage from a textbook growing season.,There is potential here! Still young, but already great! The tannins are still a bit rough but will well develop with time. Not too much sweetness and good acidity. Great finish that will become a 5/5 in few years in my opinion! Cheers 🍷,Incredible port. Smooth. Vanilla, ripe plum and a long finish. ,Quinta do Noval Vintage Port 2018.   WS NYC,Ohhh yes. Young vintage from Quinta Noval.

A bit of grassiness adds depth, but I don't think it needs it.,There’s a lot of excitement about this port, and it’s easy to see why.  The nose is lovely and fresh, violets and vibrant black fruit.  A lot of weight on the palate, dense and spiced, while retaining a clear sense of purity and lift.  Excellent balance of sweetness, tannin and acidity.  A great prospect. ,There is potential here! Still young, but already great! The tannins are still a bit rough but will well develop with time. Not too much sweetness and good acidity. Great finish that will become a 5/5 in few years in my opinion! Cheers 🍷,Really delicious. Well balanced fruity character(plum, blackberry, cherry), long lasting finish with licorice, chocolate, deep oak, leather flavor. Better than silval 1996 vintage.,Herbal, some stem/green notes, red fruit like red currants and raspberries, black currants and blackberries, high acidity and has excellent structure. Austere at the moment but will be very long lived.,Wait! This wine will be brilliant, but only if we wait...opening bottles of this now can be equated with nothing less than oenological infanticide. Wait!,Incredible power, fragrant, ripe black fruit, sweet, dense. Actually quite enjoyable even so young.,Consistent with previous editions, it’s a great vintage Port, an extraordinary eine"

1174337,"A balanced wine with great vivacity , nice evolution, good length with matured and fine tannins, a great one from Portugal with a bright future ,First time with this Portuguese legend. At 13 years of age this is a full fruit super structured and full body red. Tannins well resolved, long finish and overall great wine. ,This is a very well produced wine from very old plants. Complex, structured and tasty wine.,Fruity, round, good acidity, medium body, long finish. It keeps getting better!!,Never given a wine  a 5 before. Really, really  wonderful wine experience. In magnum and 15 years in the waiting. Mature, fruity, so smooth and concentrated with an incredible freshness. So, so nice.,Smooth, fruity, nice pencil oak, very juicy,expansive mouthful of sweet tertiary flavours – spicy plum, dried fig and panforte with warm, sun-scorched earth.,Mouchão is always good, no matter wich wine you choose...just go for it!,Amazing! Perfect with fish and shrimp.,Shown the complexity and 10+years of aging but still have a long way to age,Something wrong with this particular wine(year?). I am a big fan of Mouchao wines, but as Mouchao 2003 (theoretically the same wine) there is something in the aroma that stops me from drinking this one even after hours in a decanter, herbaceous, smoke from green wood!? Not sure but something completely unpleasent,Perfect portuguese so many flavours,Very good wine,Basically the traditional Mouchão 2002 with the addition of being kept in the producers cellar until  its fit for optimum consumption. The usual black ripe fruit nose with balsamic,light wood and dark chocolate notes.Full palate of jam and ripe fruit,vanilla and figs,wood and almonds...balsamic. The full body gives way to a very persistent end with good acidity filling the palate.There is a trapped spirit in the bottle that makes you eat and drink more.Be very careful!!!! ,Excelente! Potente, elegante, macio, carvalho intenso no final. 🍷🍷"
1175183,"Fantastic discovery from Portugal. Great coupage of white varieties, with lots of potential. Great oak ageing that leaves you asking for more (ageing). Nobility. A very solid 4-star with potential for more perhaps trying with more ageing in bottle.  Aromas of citrics. Apricots. Green plums. Fresh yeast. Lots of minerality. That hint of toasted caramel from the wooden barrels so typivlcal from elegant Chardonnays. In mouth, volume. Evolutive with time. From 'less' to 'more'. More Personality than Intensity. ,Fruity scent with tones of white peach, minerals and some oak and pears. Nice round palate with some sweet liquorice tones,World Class wine,This wine was nearly at the bottom in a blind lineup. And after multiple retastings I have to agree that this scoring was justified.  Medium yellow with nose of green peppers, apples, white grapes, raw oak. Medium+ mouth feel and viscosity. Medium+ finish, unbalanced and lacking integration.   Likely has potential down the road but not ready now. Would hold 2-3 years minimum. ,Clear white in colour, pear on the nose. Rich, intense, complex, minerals, sweet pear, soft lemon.  My last Grau white wine drank on a day England potentially resurrected their test reputation and my son scored 91. Really happy with this wine, the quality to cost value of the wine bought from Grau has shocked me ever time I opened a bottle..,Exciting white blend of 10+ portuguese varieties. Good complex nose and elegant creamy but fresh mouth. Liked it,A tropical nose, pineapple and mango. Palate I'd say is more green fruits. Lime. Bit of weight from the battonage. We had some slight bottle variation here at the tasting. ,Enjoyed it. Nice spice. Cool label , minerals apple tropical oak,My rating is 4,1 . Cc,On a lighter side, but mineral ant tasty,Clear, bright light intensity with a touch of green shades. Freshly sliced green apples on the bouquet. Healthy dose of malic acid on entry. Interesting texture, perhaps some skin maceration in elements of this Douro white blend? Medium plus acid. Medium alcohol. Perhaps this will age well and soften some. ,Decent white. Medium body, medium flavour. Oakey but not overpoweringly so. ,Think soft burgundy oak Chardonnay from Portugal ,Dry fairly acidic taste furthermore quite sweet pear  tasting wine.  If wine is given air and swirled longer this taste becomes rather more stronger. Drunk while eating pork which combined together very well. "

The palate is quite developed, very silky, with clove, cinnamon and nutmeg spice. High acidity, but not as high as the 2000 vintage.  Superb! ,Great port. Colhetas are bottles on demand.

Goes well by itself or with fruit, caramel or cream based deserts or cheese.,Single vintage and Quinta harvest and bottled 2009 what could go wrong? Not much, well balanced Tawny Port where the sweetness of the wine doesn’t take overhand. Perfectly on its own or to the usual blue cheese etc. 4.25⭐️,Ups! Needed a port for my portwine sauce.

Nose of caramel, alcohol, dried figs and dates, walnut, wood smoke. The palate is full of Christmas spice, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. After 14 years in oak the tannins are super silky. Piercingly high orange peel acidity which gives it a very vibrant feel, but will not be to everyone's taste. Noval's 20 Year Old Tawny is easier to drink, but has less personality. More in comments >>,The 2000  Quinta do Noval Porto Colheita Tawny is superb, showing warm and welcoming notes of caramel, dried fruit, honey, sultana along with a pinch of toast. The mind immediately jumps to pairings like stilton, Roquefort, or dried fruit, though, surprisingly the staff at Noval recommend trying it with fresh carrot, unpeeled. I love the this Port's vibrancy and balance, the palate bright, like a newly minted penny, its brimming over with walnut shells, figs, golden raisins, and spice cake. Just lovely. 20.5% ABV,My favorite colheita from the Quinta so far. So velvety and balanced that you can easily drink many glasses of it. I like the ""dulce de leche"" touch it has now.

This nutty finish is balanced well with a great acidity. ,Caramel, orange marmalade, fruitcake, walnut, ground cocoa, and some dustiness. This port had a lot going on with it and everyone else at the table seemed to appreciate that as well. It didn’t quite have the viscosity or richness I was expecting from Noval though, so not quite the perfect wine. But a great one to serve after a night spent tasting lots of different wines and wanting to end on a high note.,18/20. Still fresh and fruity. Berries,cherry, drugstore, fruits, vanilla, wood, caramel, nuts. Extremely balanced on the palate. Tannins, sweetness, bitterness and acidity are in harmony.

1206377,"Tasted beside the 1977 Taylor with the winemaker David Guimaraens, it doesn't get better than this. Stunningly powerful yet full of grace, poise and timelessness. The purity of fruit and pulsating veins of acidity just like the Taylor but this 77 Fonseca had a slightly more refined mouthfeel and rounder explosion of fruit. This was my favourite wine of the tasting. ,For the Love of Port 2017 Meet Up - Chicago Voted the winner of the night, and well deserved! Beautiful beautiful wine with a good life ahead,A superb 1977 vintage port. Have had this about 30-35 times over the last 25 years and it definitely back in form. For a few years it was rather thin but now it is fantastic ,Wow !! This 1977 Fonseca is irresistibly good, boquet of ripe berries, prunes and raisins, taste of mocha, dark chocolate, coffee, and long fruity delicious aftertaste of ripe berries, this is on top now and does not get better just different and even more ripe with longer storage, I think this can last for at least another 40-50 years.  98p,4.9.

More like a Tawny at this point, with lots of pecan, almond, caramel, toffee, earth notes, bitter chocolate, and a very long finish. Another glass please!,Was almost past it’s useful date. Cork was mostly in good shape but bottom 1/4” stayed in the bottle. Color was bricked; light orange. Last maybe 1 1/2” was sediment. Taste was great. Nose and taste was spot on.

Touch of dark chocolate, blackberry, licorice, berries and spice. ,Best port I've ever had. Rated 100. Had with Bev and Jim and Kerry and Kristen.

The fruit has broken down into a soft velvety finish., From one of the more highly rated vintages of the last century this was perfect now.

Terrific poise & a fine finish.,Delicious mature port, a big treat to try this.  Still plenty of dried fruit character, medicinal, with chocolate and spice.  Not overly sweet, the intensity and structure easily carry both the sugar and the alcohol.  Complex and layered, lovely port.    I'd put this above Graham's 1985, just below Dow's 1985, but that may be personal preference more than an objective assessment of quality. ,What an amazingly rich and complex port, lovely nose and flavors just pour over and play on the palate to a smooth long finish,Phenomenally balanced wine with all the key elements.

Real class.  Enormous body. Dynamical. Fruity. Enough acidity.   Has breed.,Love this. I have always loved the peppery, spicey sweet Grenache and lack of excessive softness that has been the style Fonseca that over time. I recall the ‘63 like that. This is really wonderful. Fresh, vigorous, racy, not too heavy or sweet. Still quite young. Peak in 5 years ? It may soften and integrate but the risk is losing that wonderful peppery fruit.

This half bottle was a gift from the manager of my neighbourhood wine shop. How nice of him! Decanted and left overnight, this offered up very rich and heady aromas of figs and raisins. A lot more going on on the palate: hazelnuts, intense dark cherries, figs, macerated plums and chocolate. This had a nice backbone of acidity which kept the flavors fresh throughout. I would say this was very accessible after extended aeration. Paired with roquefort. Classic.,Almost black color.  On the nose with aromas of ripe berries, liquorice, some butterscotch and violets.  Soft and round on the palate with silky, well-integrated tannins and lots of fig fruit.  Warm, ripe finale with a long-lasting berry fruit.,Said goodbye to a good friend who is moving with this port & good cigars.  18 year old port for a friend that has lived in Dallas 18 years.

Very good for special occasions ,A fantastic wine from a fantastic Lodge that has only slightly missed the mark for this truly remarkable vintage.,Soil and bark dominate the nose. This is a very unique Port - I had to return to it to make sure my notes were correct. Indonesian curry comes to mind as a pairing, with lemongrass and banana leaf notes  This would make a great pairing with Hawaiian laulau as well, or perhaps a sticky rice dessert.,A dark red wine with a simple, strong, sweet, well-defined raisin note with a smooth, long sweet finish with a hint of barrels.,Deep, dark ruby, opaque. Nose is dark chocolate,Dutch cocoa, and sweet home-brewed vanilla extract. Stewed cherries at the end of the nose.  Medium body for a fortified wine, so not heavy and cloying. Alcohol makes it hot on the palate and it has a long finish.  Barely any raisin on this. Flavors are more chocolate and rum-soaked cherries. Alcohol is powerful but there is a dry tannic edge to it too.  I wish this weren’t $100+ a bottle as I want more, but I noted on the bottle, ‘not for chugging - $100! 🤪,Very fruity with loads of blackberries, blueberries and cherries. Then very peppery and tight. On the palate it is initially super-sweet but then very tannic, acidic and tight. Right now it is totally teenager clumsy but in 10-15 years it will certainly come together. Hard to rate at this early stage but obviously really great potential. 97-100p,2017 is still dense and closed. Great potential once the tannins soften out.

The other was the colour: I have malt whiskies which are paler (though this had a reddish tint to its hue). Citrus, saline, minerality and apricot.,Nr#3 at After Holiday Tasting, Riesling from Portugal. Nose of furniture wax, paint, taste is high acidity. Overripe grape fruit, bitter.

Well made and with good 2-3 year potential. Well balanced,A good everyday wine from Portugal. Shows a lot of red fruit mostly and bit vanilla.

Bit peppery, slight citrus.,Very good with goat cheese,This is Portugal red wine from Alentejano region. On eye: deep ruby color. On nose: nice fruit but medium intensity.

Grade is barely 3,5 ⭐️ (3,4).,Blend of Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouschet this is an inexpensive dry red with earthly notes, leather, graphite but short finish.,A bottle we gave some time to let the little reductive whiff dissolve. Afterwards there’s plenty of raspberries, cherries and perhaps a little blueberry... On the palate it’s the fresh approach in combination with the fruit that stands out. The modest use of oak has just a supporting function. Nice wine. Feminine. Perhaps a little aggressive touch from the acidity and a little short but for 9,50€, this is well done!,Bold and full bodied wine. Dry, med tannins, mug oak, savory and a lasting finish with a subtle sourness. Powerful ,Aroma: Lush red fruit, elegant, fresh, satiny and with good complexity.

Another great white from Douro valley. Burgundy style. Great RQP Highly recommended! ,I start to really like white wines from Douro. This is still super young, very floral and quite fatty. Great nose of vanilla oak, white peach, pear. Lighter on the palate than expected from the nose. Will but more from the region and keep. I start to think there are hidden gems in this terroir worth finding. ,This type of wine get's a lot of advantage, when is kept for some time in a barrique... Structure and long acidity...

Perhaps this was a lesser vintage, or maybe not my style of wine. Dark ruby color, and a pleasant enough nose with plenty of blackberry and some pepper notes.

Colour is dark ruby with brown hue.. Nose is intensely jammy with black fruit and baking spice with chocolate and pepper aromas.. Incredible how much is going on there.. Palate is has loads of fruit and spice but not jammy as the nose.. This wine seems youthful and fresh and yet it has hit adulthood in human terms. Huge complexity and intensity without refinement.. This is wine made in the traditional way and feels that way..  Still too young..,Too pricey for what it offers, even after decanting it for 30+ minutes.

1267518,"Garrafeira a style initiated by Niepoort, lets say a kind of cross between ruby and tawny even if it is more tawny style -  this one was set in demi jonhs in 1982 and bottled in 2007 - Pure, clean and straight but a bit closed at beginning, a port wine that really needs time to open up - it is all about elegance, it still feels quite young and gets a beautiful freshness #PortWineDay  #winelover,WOW! strong and heavy prunes, caramel, very mature. intense, bold ink. love it!,Great wine In combination with cheese and gelly pot!,So amazing, honied pralines and orange blossom, figs, tobacco, cherries, complex as hell with a length that goes for near eternity, a unique experience.

Has the color of an aged Pinot Noir. Notes of red raspberry, sour cherry, garrigue, caramel, toffee, and even a touch of nuttiness. It’s extremely elegant for a Port and the alcohol isn’t burning. The fruit takes center stage here. This doesn’t bring the power of a Vintage Port nor the explosive nuttiness of a Tawny but it does bring complexity and length. It can cellar for many years. ,The best of two Worlds;  The Child of Madame Vintage and Senor Tawny.  Aged in Wood and Demijohn bottles.  Freshness, Complexity, in great harmony.  Just amazing.

I'm just now beginning to discover Portuguese wines, and I'm becoming a big fan. This one had a wonderful nose, full body, ample structure, and most importantly, character. It's not too often that can be said for a wine that costs only $15. Perhaps it was that 2011 was an excellent year for Douro. I also realize this isn't the most complex Douro out there, so I'm looking forward to trying the others that I've been picking up.,I really can’t believe how good this was. It had not only lasted but had improved immeasurably. The later vintages are good but the 2008 was superb.

Smooth and elegant with great structure and lots of fruit. Blueberries, blackberries, plum and cedar dominate the palate. Fantastic.,Excellent wine Structured, smooth with nice acidity, very elegant fruitiness with taste of cedar, ripe strawberries and bramble. Mature but still developing. Field blend, approximately 30 different types of grapes approx 120 years old vines. Every single bottle has been tasted and re-corked. ,Phenomenal. Brown purple in colour. A great evolution with time as the nose at first presented an aroma of ripe or even rotten apples which then evolved into vanilla, tobacco spice &wood. In mouth it displayed nothing but elegance. Thin &silky. Super sophisticated. Explosion of fruits, then earthy notes, then vanilla in a massive show of complexity. Fairly short finish with firm tannins which clung onto my teeth very heavily. After an hour or two they softened into pure silk. Fine acidity with lush texture.,A vertical tasting of this small Douro Fojo winery. This 2001 vintage still has a quite clear rubi red color. Moderately intense red fruit aromas with notes of sweet chocolate, liquorice and vanilla, which are short lasting in the glass. Medium-bodied (14.0%), very well-balanced Portuguese wine with nice acidity and alcohol. Tannins are lively, smooth and rounded, leaving a strong, bold, lightly sweet and persistent finish. A 90-GB pts very nice wine.,Delicious, rich with ripe red berries ,This was a fiiine Douro. Rich and bouncy. ,Lush on palate and finish ,Good, somewhat subtle Douro. Mature, ready.

Purchased at Astor Center, New York City. ,A turned violet Portuguese Douro with a subtle nose on berries. It is generous and firm with proper acidity. Inspire of its age it could still go to the cellar for another decade. ,At 18 years from vintage, this one has already peaked and is headed into decline. Drink it now! Enjoyed in Terceira Island while out to dinner with family. Would be 4.5, but dropped.5 due to partial decline.,Lovely aged red wine—tastes like a port but more of a table wine. Smooth and perfect with spicy steak!,Excellent. Slightly confusing re the price though. We paid around 45 euros in a good Portuguese restaurant compared to the average price suggestion of £55 retail. At our price it is fantastic value for a superbly smooth and tannin free medium bodied wine with a decent aftertaste and good length on the palate. I will look out for this wine whenever in Portugal ,Fantastic food-friendly aged wine, striking a balance between obvious tertiary and secondary aromas, and black fruit still fresh, thin yet elegant, and almost silky. At 14% alcohol, it does not overpower the flavors."

 Speaking about vivid fruit aromas and sublime wood integration!

 On the palate you have a layered expression with a recurrence of most aromas from the nose, combined with a perfect balance of tannins and acidity.  🔽🔽🔽comments🔽🔽🔽,[Vivino Leuven 9/11] @[1|17441025|Koen Danhieux] ▶️ @[1|411157|Dries Thirion] I’m starting to like blind tasting, even if I’m not particularly talented. I like it because it confirms why certain wines made me the wine fan I am. Crasto ‘s Reserva is one of them and this mature one knocked it out of the park!! Meaty nose with cinnamon, coffee, perfect oak, blackberry, black currant and smoke followed by a palate with perfect acidity/tannines balance, plenty black fruit and plum. What a finish also!! 4.6,This classic Douro Crasto vinhas velhas or reserva is a great Douro red, very consistent and regular year after year.  From a vineyard as age as 70-100 years and a very low production, hand picked grapes and maleolatic fermentation in new french oak barrels for 18 months emerges this complex red.  Great logevity marks this beutifull fullbodied wine made with tipical portuguese grapes of Douro.  Gold/Silver WS 94 Vivino 4,2  Excellent!!!,Wishlisted #9  A wine from my list wisely selected by @Koen Danhieux from  his 2 cases. The time was about right now to start drinking these top bottles.

Thanks to share this one.  Rate 4,4⭐️,Intense aromas of blackberry, black cherry, blueberry, black currant prunes and violet. Balanced, complex, deep texture and elegant structure. Powerful tannins, well integrated in full body with cigar box, fine chocolate and coffee luxurious aromas. Very long finish ,This is in such a good place right now. Much evolved from trying it 3 years ago when it was uneven. Depth and quality of dark old vine fruit shines through. Polished and rather elegant in its structure/tannins with well judged oak that has married the fruit very well. Didn’t decant and drank rather quickly, certainly worth giving it some air to see what complexity of flavour lies underneath. Beautiful texture, balance and finish,It’s been one year since I last tasted this wonderful Douro. It seems even better. Lots of matured fruits, flowers, vanilla and spices (black tea and sandalwood). On the palate is dense, a fine texture tannins, balanced. It keeps on the aftertaste the fruits, vanilla, flowers and some tobacco for a long, long time.   Este grande Douro melhora a cada ano que passa. Aromas de frutas maduras, violetas, baunilha e especiarias (chá preto e sândalo). Corpo médio cheio, mas denso, taninos muito finos e equilibra,Fantastic Douro!!! Perfectly in tune from nose to mouth. Full of ripe berries and plums, with vivid hints of spices and Port wine in the aftertaste.

The wine structure supports a braised short rib with duck fat cauliflower purée, as the tannins smoothens the dish and brings out the flavors in the food.,The work to make a single blend in touriga is an excellent start. Balenced, surprisingly fresh and fruity with clear notes of wood and a proper care by the wine maker. A really good surprise in the offer of this whine house. ,Deep dark ruby colour. Atimas of licorice, meaty, leather, black fruits. On the palare,tannins are strong, medium alcohol and body,medium acidity, long finish.

1361931,"Fruity oily full & rich but not too much. Very suprising very enjoyable,Fruité et long en bouche, excellent vin ,The bottle is soooo heavy, that I wondered what wine deserves this treat ?  Alvarinho Arinto e Antão Vaz, from Alentejo, clear and clean, a bit yellow straw colour, mineral armas with some stone fruit, more peach than apricot and a bit of quince, still fresh... Flavours of medium minus intensity, minerality and the somehow tiered freshness of citric fruits...  Well a normal bottle would have done it, for this wine you don't need an 1kg glass bottle, what a waist for an ok wine... Actually the Alvarinho...,Maybe not the best pairing, the food was initially overpowering it. After setting it aside a while the quality was undeniable. Oily nose with lemon, stone fruit and pineapple followed by a wonderfully complex palate with perfect acidity and beautifully infused wood. 3.9,Very nice. Soft, elegant. Some honey. Ideal balance. Some oak, little pepper.,Very distinctive ripe cherries and sweet spices flavours. Full bodied with Impressive long finish. Quite earthy though only 25% new oak barrel.,Some reductive (in a positive way) notes,  oak, almonds and dried fruit notes.  Complex and full-bodied, with a long finish.,Fine wines for the barbie#3: Expectation was high but it was a bit disappointing,.. all the ingredients were there to spoil the nose and the tasting buds but the intensity was so weak...a pity.,Balanced and full body,Great wine.

Aged entirely in stainless steel, so no oak.  Black fruit aromas like blackberry and blueberry.  Dry, medium minus acidity, medium body, 13.0% ABV.  Organically farmed in the Douro.  Fermentation with naturally occurring yeast makes this close to a “natural” wine.  Whole cluster fermentation picks up tannins from stems, seeds, and skins.  Great value for an aged, balanced red wine.  ,Strongly aromatic with notes of oak and cherry, this dry, deep purple wine had forward blackberry and moderate earthy notes that lightly dance on the tongue. ,Fruit fun from Douro,Good red wine, with full flavor and aroma.

It greets you in the nose with notes of blue and black fruits and mint aromas.

Well structured. Long finish, good aftertaste.  Very good wine from Portugal (regional alentejano). ,A complex and balanced white.,Aroma of ripe black fruit, wood notes and hints of spice. The palate follows the nose, with big and firm tannins, medium acidity, and a long and elegant finish.,Plummy, easy drinking, little Woody ,started off dry and edgy but soon showed a nice smooth complexity,Very pleasent in the nose, aromatic with fresh fruits sorrounded by balsamic notes smoke and spices.

Lots of fruit also on the palette and noticeable tannins combined with a depth and Fruity sweet makes this a noticeable wine. Very long finish. May improve further over time.,Excellent full bodied red blend from Portugal.  Syrah, Alicante boushet, cab sauv. Gift from traveling children.  Solid Cab like feel with blackberry nose and dark cherry richness.  Lovely wine.  Can't wait to taste the reserve brought home now in storage.,im not entirely sure about the nose,  but i sense green pepper, bell pepper, it smells like what one would expect from an aged wine  oily appearence, intense yellow with grenish notes  tastewise, I detect more fruity aromas than I would have expected accompanied by herbal notes,....very cgarming on the palate...with closed eyes i could possibly take that for a red wine,Remember Lilt (with the totally tropical taste)? Well, not that. But a rush of tropical fruits nonetheless: mango, pineapple, melon. It’s just that Lilt doesn’t really have the tarragon and salty finish. Great glugger and goes like salt and vinegar with your fish (scarlet prawns and golden bream on this occasion).   Yikes! Rating #1964 - year of my birth!,Lots of tanins, wonderful blackberry color!,Dark fruit, violets, bit of jam, very intense, long. A great wine"

An excellent example of the high quality, value-prices wines you find in Portugal. ,I generally stay away from blends but this one hit the spot paired with sautéed mushrooms in soy sauce and a miso-glazed cod with a group of 4. To that effect, it is fairly imposing and a little drier than I expected initially, but the palate balances out and becomes much silkier as the wine opens. I bought it at $13, and feel that this was a very good value wine. ,4-4.5 rating. Tasted in 2016 WineStyle at Botanical Winter Wine Market. $22-24 AUD.,Black fruits and very ‘mineral’. ,Very smooth.

With my nose in the glass they are met with warm intensity, ripe prune, some strawberry, oak and rhubarb. The ball is dropped somewhat in the palate though.

Still stuff to discover: plum, overripe grapefruit, maple syrup, fig, chocolate and burnt notes. 3.7,Nose of raisin, fig, brown sugar and tobacco. Flavors of prune, fig, raisin, plum, vanilla and tobacco.  A little ""hot"". Long finish of raisin and other dried fruit. Paired with a chocolate cake with raspberry drizzle ,Almost mapley taste.

1650763,"This is the white version, which is confusing Vivino because of the label. Smell is apple and taste is peachy - but it’s very subtle. This is as good as Planalto - from the same winery,First off, the listing above states this is a red wine! It is clearly! A white wineEven the label states Vino Branco! So my rating is based on this wire wine from the Douro. So grape Vinhos is Portugal’s biggest producer. They’ve been at it a looong time. Remember Mateus? That’s there founding wine I think.

Amazing wine!,PT grapes - an alphabetical assortment (#22/22 - Viosinho): I'm not sure if they've changed the concept here but while the online info (for the 2016) talks about an altitude wine (600m), looking notably high on acidity (7.10g/l / pH3.00), the label for this the 2017 says it's 'predominantly' from high ground. Anyway, there's still a decent piquancy of acidity which, combined with a subtle nose, good body, and a fine, balanced palate of preserved lemon and citrus peel, makes for a classy product. (14% abv).,Excellent minerality and clean finish, a tad light in depth perhaps but on a summer’s day eating outside.

Slight bitterness and chlorophyll notes in the finish. Refreshing but pretty simple and too varietal aromas.,Between 3.0 and 3.5 but not entirely convinced on the palate. An example of a good wine, with a marked influence of verdelho, but that just seems to miss something. Maybe a bit more weight to balance the acidity.

The last wine from the first round of this wonderful line of Cortes de Cima. I always liked these wines a lot. Maybe the least exciting as it's quite ""common"" grape for me but nevertheless it's always a great pleasure to taste a good TN. Ruby purple colour with a bouquet of blackberry, plum, well integrated spicy background, some tiny flowery nuances. Medium-bodied, medium acidity and medium+bodied. Very firm tannins. Complex flavours similar to aromas plus dark chocolate, vanilla.,Deep red but rather cloudy. Nose shows blue berry and cherry, perhaps with a hint if tar. Rich mouthfeel, with less tannin than I was expecting, and so less grip. Fruit forward. Slightly lacking structure, although very gentle tannins appear at mid palate to give gentle length. ,Spicy, peppered aroma when first opened with initial tight and dry finish.  Given some time, opens nicely with fruit accents and easier on the palette (not so dry).  Me likes especially for the value.  Just finished off with Greek BBQ chicken, Greek salad and garlic bread.

Pair with BBQed pork cuts and spicy chocolate fudge for desert.,Purple colour to it, oak and dark fruit on the nose. Tasted BlackBerry, blueberry, oak, with a little spice on the finish. Tannins present but well balanced. For this single varietal I was expecting something a little more robust but perhaps it’s more Malbec than Cab Sav. Enjoyable bottle, not outstanding though.,Nice juicy, some herbs from Syrah, strenght and structure from petit verdot and touriga to make it real Portugese. Especially after a few years, showing full potential. Lovely! \n,Cinnamon accents provide a zesty essence to the cherry tart and plum flavors. Dried herbal tones on the tannic finish. "

Bold, Off dry and medium acidity,Fairly light, sort of a bright red fruit, jammy nose. A somewhat interesting taste combination of acidic red fruit like Rainier cherries, and moderate dryness, but not tannic - more like a light dusty finishing flavor. Smooth and drying finish. Somehow, perhaps more appealing than the above sounds, and worked well with sardine avocado toast.,Medium purple density. On the nose there is a strong floral potpourri.

Very clean with nice spice notes very red fruit and tart berries. ,Very nice red wine with notes of cherry, oak, tobacco, plum and dark chocolate. 3,5⭐️,Best one from Tras os Montes so far. Still preferring the Vinho Verde,Great value. Initially has a light approach, but quickly shows off its caracther made of a very stony, granitic, profile with deliciously integrated fruit, very mineral always very elegant and impressively drinkable. For a 5yo wine this is quite impressive given that it is the entry level wine of a three tier project. Amazing value,Nice, dry, smooth fruity,Bold taste, quite tannic.

Round tannins and medium+ acidity. 🏁Medium finish but with nice intensity. Spices. 🗒️This has been sitting in my cellar for quite some time, but I swear it can easily take at least another 5 years there.🧓 It kept growing over the 1h30 of aeration, didn't try further.,Moderately intense dark fruit on the nose with hints of spice and rustic characteristics (cut grass, forest floor, etc) but the dark fruit switches to waves of red plum and cherry while keeping the moderate density.  The rustic scents linger at the back of the nose while the spices integrates into the palate.  The layers have very broad range and lingering transitions with very light contrasts from tobacco and graphite in the background.  Balance is a bit off with only hints of acidity.,Ruby color.

What a delicious wine, with a great character,Nice dry. With a slight bite,Had 1984 vintage over a cabbage dish at Belcanto in Lisbon. Beautiful deep golden colour. Oily nose with hints of honey as well. Body is very subtle and little or no acidity but that’s quite expected for the vintage. Bit of smoke and hints of pepper and citrus in the finish ,From a winery steeped in the history of Dão wine founded in 1920 by two brothers, this was a delightfully different treat. Popped and poured, our initial sniff and sip gave away its age. Earthy aromas with underbrush, herbs and surprisingly lively red fruits on the palate. Burgnut described the mouthfeel quite aptly as like a ""rusty nail."" This may not sound appetizing but this is a wine that's better experienced and drank than my words can describe. Thanks Burgnut for sharing this Portuguese gem. Viva Dão!,A great foil for a mature Burgundy especially in the first 30-45 minutes before the sourness in the finish takes greater prominence. Rusty nails and forest floor notes in the nose and palate combined with rose petals, wild strawberries, Asian spices, plums and worn leather. Excellent entry but the mid-palate is short on depth and complexity which is where it departs from a solid Burg and morphs into an aged Rioja.   Easily the best Portuguese dry red I've tasted.,4.2...  Beautiful notes of red fruit, pine, mushroom, cigar, and perfume. This is medium bodied and elegant. The wine has the texture of a Village level red Burgundy. If this finish was a tad longer, this would be through the roof amazing. ,Delicious wine and amazing value for the age. Unfortunately the nuance faded quickly once opened. Old peat, smoke, plum prune, raisin. Felt similar to an amarone. ,Excellent state of conservation, lovely evolved color still with tannin enough and some fruit in mouth for the current age,Brick red. Plums, good and balanced tannins.

1811412,"Robust & understated like our 1st woman President. ,Opening red for the tasting with Nik and Mathias, and my contribution. Strong nose of oak- usually this precedes a wine I don't love. But in this case, the very present oak was softened by deep plum and jammy dark fruits. I wouldn't drink it alone, but as a great compliment to a protein rich meal. I had the pleasure of meeting one of the family members while on vacation in Sintra, Portugal. A nice representative for the terroir. ,The first red that Beth, Mathias & I had during our great evening on Friday, a 100% Touriga Nacional with heavy oaking.  12.5% abv, dark purple red, oily slow tears, inky.

Palate was similar with fruit flavors quickly masked by gravel, turned earth, tobacco leaf, and some green bell pepper. Layered flavors were harmonious. I wish it would of had more fruit, but I loved this wine. Smooth tannins and a lingering finish. ,Sumptuous rich tannic and (my favorite descriptor) old world spices.  This is thick with the aroma of leather, with a basil-ish/eucalyptus-ish back notes. Yes, there’s cherry too on the palate but it’s it’s far far from the CA Cab version of cherry.   ,dragon syndicate and goblins stoked about all work as structured non life with digital marketing friends fyi back home breaking out the oldest huffing wigs from the outside closet and driving around town with the sundown ,A fruit forward red from Portugal featuring the Toriga Nacional grape.

But what better place to grow this grape than in the beautiful furnace of the Douro Valley. Produced by the great Quinta Da Romaneira, this is a banker.   Heavy laden with black cherry and plum. Firm but rounded tannins, concentrated but not overripe, it has superb balance for such a big, rich wine. With a long, sumptuous baked fruit finish that goes on and on. Delicious 🇵🇹 ⭐️,Wow, don't have Petit Verdot very often at all. Just hard to find I guess. Saw it on the list and figured I'd give it a go. Black cherries and blueberries. Floral and herbal on the nose too. High tannins were really accessible. Great balance. Wine of the night for my group. ,4,1- again great PV already rated. Really fresh lively red fruits. At this stage very ready to drink,Tannic, black fruit, blackcurrant, oak, cocoa. Nice! ,A single grape wine with personality.,This was really delicious. I was impressed. Full body. Complex. Full mouth. Really good,Very fruity and elegant Syrah. Fragrant stewed fruits on the nose. Smooth palate of plums, dark cherries, hints of chocolate. I expected something bold and powerful. It does have noticeable alcohol, but still feels quite soft, with polished tannins.  Like the Romaneira Petit Verdot - I enjoyed it but wouldn’t pay €20 for it again. There are plenty of cheaper options that provide the same level of enjoyment."

1924186,"What a wonder and a chance to explore some new grape varieties. Have you put Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional on your list? The fun in this region is the small capacity of individual vineyards and the local co-operativa that produce and market a range of wines based on what’s available. It’s highly experimental and characterful wine making. Naturally the majority is consumed locally but the atmosphere is highly collaborative - they share secrets. This is the family’s ‘Big’ wine. Thank you for sharing!,I think this is an intriguing wine. It’s main grapes are Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. But blended with Portuguese varieties so it still has that Alentejo terroir.

A great white douro!,Citrusai, truputis persiko, žolė. Kartokas poskonis. Nesudėtingas, bet gana simpatiškas.  Citruses, hint of peach, grass. Bitterish aftertaste. Quite simple but nice.,Dry and crisp, not very complex but very fresh with citrus, lemon, green apple, mineral nuances accompanied by oak and smoke. Finish is short and slightly bitter.,Acid notes in the beginning was very interesting. As it warms, it tastes more like sauvignon blanc (more acidic).,Very clear yellow color, soft on the nose with some mineral feshness, quite intense on the pallete: flint, capsicum, grass, lemon. Mineral taste with growing acidity (but not as high as i expected), finish is with smoke and bitterness. Lasting taste. Interesting, pleasant. Good value / quality balance. ,I love a good Douro white. This is not one of those though. Rabigato & Viosinho, 20% aged in new oak, all looking good on paper but this is just vapid & empty with little to no personality.  Pale lemon.

Not too fruity but tasty notes of berries and even green tobacco. ,I tried the 2007, it's strong, oak smell, very special taste. Good at vintage wine category.

Finally, everything you buy with this label is exceptionally well crafted. Obrigado! ,Also vintage 2019 Is exactly as the winemaker promises: color is deep ruby.

How is it possible that a wine with more than 50 years seems like it was produced 5 yrs ago??? ,Really interesting wine. The nose isn't too dissimilar to an old Barolo, tar/leather and dried flowers. Palate is nothing like old Barolo hahaha. It's really bizarre, and I'm assuming atypical, but the main fruit characteristic is like this tart stewed plum. Then there is a whole bunch of tannin that comes through. Unbelievable to see this level of acidity, tannin and even salinity from a wine of this age. Anyway that's my rant about the 67,Fantastic bottle that is full of subtlety. Starts with gravel and fig aromas. Medium texture. As it opens there is just so much more going on.

Surprisingly, because although the vintners goes back to the 1600s - it’s still a “just” a competent medium to large scale wine factory.

But here’s the question, if I can’t detect the chem tricks - it must be a good wine?? ,Yellow, greenish color, with moderate acidity. Good flavors and smells of citrus and tropical fruit. Sweet. In terms of smell and taste, it is a pleasant white from Bairrada region, for those who enjoy sweet wine  (which is not my case).

Got this lovely at a little wine shop in Ojai, CA. Perfecto!,Excellent full bodied Touriga Nacional. Bold at first. But as time goes, it became smooth  Very well made wine.

After a 48 hour period of pre-fermentative cold maceration, the fermentation has occurred in french oak barrels. Aging  in french oak barrels 11m. Bottle aging for 3m. Deep ruby and violet colour. Floral notes typical from the grape variety and spicy notes from the barrel aging. Soft and silky tannins.  ,Ripe berries and plums upfront with an initial jammyness that wanes as the wine opens up. Very smooth mouthfeel and a long finish that has you wanting to take another sip. Not a harsh note in the bottle makes it very easy to drink. A really nice alternative red at a good price.,Dark, full bodied red with plum and black currant on the nose. Leather and tobacco are readily identifiable on the palate.,Blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, violet. Really nice value.

Really good wine.,Medium-bodied, savory and earthy, rose hip, pomegranate, red currant, sour cherry, pepper, sage, earl grey, lavender, oak, mushroom, tobacco, leather ,An intense Portuguese red with deep dark plum and blackberry flavors. Heavier than most tempranillos this wine will taste well even after three days of being open. Will pair with lamb and flank steak or gamey dark meats. Not a lot of bright fruit, so not a wine to have just as a cocktail. ,Earthy with notes of milk chocolate and coffee and some plum in the back, this wine is creamy and has balanced acidity.  There's nothing fruity in this wine.  I note the tannins that promote its dryness though they aren't strong.  Vij described this as table wine.  We'll try it again once it opens up.  Day 2 - a very different wine.  The strong plum is prominent and I feel more of the alcohol, acidity and body.  Today it tastes like what I would expect of Alentejo.  So let it open up."

Not really complex but a pleasure to drink. Not an everyday blend of Vinhão (70%), Alvarinho(15%) and Pinot Noir(15%). Red cherry, lime and  some flint.

Really enjoyed it, and if tasted blind would probably have to think about it a couple of times before guessing. ,Curious, light, mineral, Monção e Melgaço red. It's mainly Vinhão, but with 15% Alvarinho. Vinhão makes light-bodied, acidic wines, so blending it with white grapes creates an unusual red/white hybrid. Red berries, apricot and peach fruit. Dry, low tannins. It works quite well around 16C, although becomes rather subdued any cooler. Good with some simple salmon noodles.

A versatile food wine!,Casa Américo Touriga Nacional 2012.   A:  What I like about the Casa Américo brand of Rioja is the way the winemakers use only French and Spanish oak.  Not many of the Riojas I've had use oak barrels (not even in the blends).  So I was surprised when I was given a bottle of Casa Américo Touriga Nacional to try.

Splendid value!,I don’t know if my bottle is wildly different than y’all’s, but the taste profile sliders were WAAAAAY off for me. To me this is light, bright, soft, and dry. Are there tannins? Sure, but it’s not tannic. This is easy drinking but complex. It’s a very interesting wine, but one that anyone can enjoy.

Discreet and sober aromas and flavors (earthy, fresh black fruit and red fruit).  Violet color, medium dry, some acidity, full-bodied. Advertised as of minimal intervention.  I applaud alcohol at 12.5 ° because it is a moderate value that makes wine more friendly and therefore more gastronomic. Contains sulphites.,Lovely, Portuguese blend of six grape varieties, matured in oak for ~1 year and 5 months in vat. Had the 2018 vintage.  Dark red with purple hues. Rich and fruity medium-bodied red with pleasant acidity and soft tannins. Strongly aromatic nose with plum and cherry predominating.

One can imagine that the wine maker has a lot of experience. The taste was in the beginning a bit harsh but once the wine was open for a while it was a complete difference.

Although seems very young and quite tannic it will improve greatly if you let it breath. It has really a strange and unique taste. But did conquer me. Aroma interesting and grows on mouth taste.,Portugese wines are different. They are very good, worth trying, but they are best to be enjoyed after 10-15 years. (Or at least decanted for 1hour plus). It is a great wine with fruits and spices mix, mushrooms and quite enjoyable aftertaste. Good job.,Soft and sour,Intriguing red made with an unusual Portuguese grape. Really good,Excellent Portuguese wine but need to be decanted, very powerful. ,Animal farm nose. Very original indeed. ,Good but expected more ,Unusual wine with floral aromas. Refined and complex but the 2013 is young even in 2017 so may need a decade to mature fully. Overall a floral nose and smooth finish. Not the big finish expected at this price point. The finish is quite long and lingers on the tase buds. This wine is a bit of an enigma - not stunning but overtly refined and a sophisticated tipple. Maybe decanting for a few hours more would really open it up."

Worth the marketing though ,Very good wine, and with a story behind: in the production process, once in bottle, it is aged 30m underwater in a Portuguese river, the absence of light and the pressure or water being 2 key factors. I suggest you try it and compare with the red wine from same producer that instead follows normal ageing (on ground) to appreciate the difference in taste!,Either most reviews here are wrong or someone didn't take care of this bottle properly before it got to me. And I think it's the latter. Shame! ,Good flavors and aromas of fruit ( black fruit and red fruit) and lots of oak and exotic yeast notes. Ruby / garnet color. Full-bodied, medium dry.

Amazing wine which proves the Douro is a top region!,[Boavista 3/3] This was an absolute gem demonstrating how higher altitude plots not facing Southwards in wine area’s like the Douro can offer an extra dimension. Fantastic nose with red apple, balsamic, kirsch, raspberry, rosebud, cranberry and a very fresh demeanor.

Quartz is the soil that the wine was planted on.  Mineral driven and well balanced. The wine was only 6months in steeltanks and therefor is pretty fresh. The additional year in the bottle made it quiet round and gave the wine a good drinking flow.  Medium body with a integrated acidity.  Mire floral than fruity and with a mineral underlining.  Did fit perfectly wirh our seabass tartare. ,A serious wine for the price. Less aromatic and floral on the nose than the standard Beyra branco, this wine is more mineral and complex while at the same time being weightier both in texture and flavour. Quite broad in the mouth but with a piquant, salty, mineral finish. I wouldn’t chill this wine too much and think probably it would benefit from some ageing. Overall very good. "

The palate is generous, rather fruity, jammy with notes of sour cherries in brandy and coffee with a sunny final,Tasty Touriga Nacional from Douro region. This wine doesn't reveal many aromas but had something interesting in it. I took once one glass in nice wine bar in Warsaw called Wino & People. Nose was at the beginning nothing special when smell but when got done breathe immediately I could feel blueberry, cherry and oak. Palate followed the nose but was more restrained than nose. A lot of work need to be done to pull the taste from this wine. Medium bold wine, expressive red in glass with medium long finish.    ,Visiting Douro is still on my bucket list.

Very powerful wine. Wine with muscles. Intense Ruby colour with dominating red fruits on the nose. These red fruits are dominating also on the palate with hints of woody oaky flavours. Very firm strong tannins but very well integrated. All these flavours are just sticking to the palate and tongue making very long finish with long lasting aftertaste. We took 2 bottles.

Round and not too heavy,So damn Good wine! Dark fruits and chocolate. Concentrated and cherry! Deep and with some nice acid,In the nose vanilla with reminescents of black fruits. Vanilla does not just cover fruits, it simply replace them. This lack of balance could be masked by some spicy, acidic food - that combination gives an extra points and makes it really drinkable.  3.5 solo, 3.7 well paired with food,Full body wine.

For those who want fresh red, look elsewhere. I would have liked to know this wine at a slightly younger age.,Granate-red with a light-red brim and orange hues, delicate nose of red currants and resin, elegant structure with fine-kerneled tannins, strong and slightly bitter palate of again red currants, resin, orange peal, mint and kardamom spice, long and rather spicy finish!

Perhaps some air will do wonders...,NB there's also a sparkling version/variant of this wine (NPT Bruto - see my 15 June 2019) that Vivino may or may not have added to its database.,Natural wine from a big traditional producer.

The grapes for white wines were sourced from terroirs (all above 550m, all 90+ years old) “that give us freshness and minerality, instead of the exuberance that sometimes characterizes the region,” said Ferreira, including, in the north, Pinhal do Norte...,Aromatic, some body to it. ,High acidity and mineral. ,Excellent!

With diverse fruity aromas and flavors (red fruit and black fruit). In the olfactory and gustatory plane it is fine.

8328815,"What a delicious wine! 😍 A very tropical fruity wine. It is light in the mouth, but has a very powerful taste.   Nose: fresh lemon and peach. Aromas of a white wine. Green apple, Peach, lemon and some pepper.  ,One of the top Rosé for Portugal im my opinion. Pale rose color, very light but with a very strong taste, accounting for the specific grape. Red fruits, pepper, maybe some other fruit, peach. A must taste.,Bottle number 0681/2541 meaning this is special. It has sold out so we are lucky to have bought 6. An orange rose colour in glass with nice clarity. A good nose flowery. In the mouth quite a different taste with a sharp but pleasant edge. Kiwi fruit sharp but very enjoyable. Met the approval of SWMBO so a good recommendation . Do try it if you can find it.,Amazing wine !!!   In nose: strawberry, cherry Mouth : soft citric flavours, lemon and orange  Good acidity, well balanced and great to pair with food (seafood e.g.) or simply to enjoy it alone ,One of the best Portuguese Roses, it will get better with some time at the bottle.,Fruity, delicate, light "
8348940,"Shiny yellow. Aged in oak barrels for 3 months. Straw, citrus and yellow garden fruits nose. Vegetal palate with dominating lemon taste. Smooth, balanced, hint of minerality, bitter finish. I expected more for a reserva, I’m either not in the mood or the wine is average 😉🥂"
8381336,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. Full-bodied, medium-dry. Still young. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Alentejo region. Contains sulfites. 14,5.° alcohol!!   "
8386795,"(3.8) Alvarinho from Tejo - my favourite style - dry and dense with gentle fruit. SS tank fermented, unoaked.  Mouthfilling intense and short on the palate with loads of limestone minerals and salinity.  Finish adds more salinity and citrus notes. Medium acidity.,Very nice refreshing Alvarinho from the southern Portuguese region of Tejo and not as one might expect from the northern vinho verde area  Clay and limestone soil  Very nice citrus acidity balancing the minerals  Recommended    ,Tejo VR, Central Portugal Alvarinho  Pale gold (so pretty!)  Nose is very inviting: toned down with citrus rind and orange blossom, mainly peach syrup, ripe orange.  Minerality in mouth is great - you can taste the terroir (chalk - clay soil). It’s synced with lemon, lemon rind.  There’s either no sugar or there’s very little. Good and long! Would be great to take with you for a dinner party to pair with cod.,Lemon citrus orangeblosom ,Super interessante 👌🏻,Light acidic wine quite. Apple ,Fresh, fruity, zesty with nice finish. That different taste that makes it stand out from the rest. Definitely need to try! ,Interesting local saucignon blanc. Surprisingly spicy.

Gorgeous raspberry aromas, outstanding acidity, not a lot of depth or complexity but just a very well put together, refreshing rosé."
8453535,"Weekday Dao blackberries and plums, tar, liguorice and vanilla oak on nose based red. Nearly fullbodied and medium fruity finish.  Ok structure and balance but slighly one dimensional texture. ,Dark purple red. Loads of tar and charcoal type of scents rising up initially. With some air these give way to dark plums, licorice and cocoa infused blackberries. Full bodied with marked tannins that frame the fruit in a slightly severe manner. Some tarry notes reappears in the finish along with a ripe, brooding and thick-skinned dark plum bonanza. I guess this is back to a mainstream, old fashion type of Dāo than a more recent velvety ‘Burgundian’ revelation. Feels like a too young dry Port. 13,5p,Fresh, young Touriga Nacional,Ink, ripe cranberry, pink peppercorn, clove, blackberry. Nicely balanced. Lingering acidity. Intense but delicate. ,Blackberry, plum, soft smooth palate, nice wine,Colour is medium ruby. Bouquet has dark cherries and berries, a bit pepper and herbs. Palate is medium-bodied +, round tannins with good balance.  Aftertaste is medium long and pleasant. Wine was ok match with Catalonia pasta pan (chorizo & sea food),3.0 bsrely. Too juicy, cherry and unfortunately too sour "
8465022,"Intense aroma of red forest fruit, predominantly raspberry.  In the mouth it surprises by the smoothness and balance.  Wine still young, with very present tannins, advising a few years of aging. Great price.,Blackberries and black cherry in the nose. Medium bold, dry, yet fruit-forward in the attack with more blackberry and some stone and leather hints in the body. Tannins up front that last throughout. The finish improves as the wine breathes. ,Ok wine, too much acidity in my mind, for 8€ I think there are much better wines in Dão"
8492810,"Citrusy and a bit sharp. Love the Arinto-led blend. €9.15 PV,Two years old got it mellow with a rich yellow color and round finish,Lively, good acidity and length, excellent,Supermarket series, the last one from the weekend, didn’t have time to taste this one. The best for last, maybe 😂 👃 a subtle nose, doesn’t reveal much, maybe a bit dull for my taste. Tropical with some citrus and minerals. A touch of fig and mango at the end.  🍷 vivid contrary to the nose, light bodied, low acidity, perfect to drink without food. A modest aftertaste. ,Fruity and delicious taste ,Fruity, raspberry, blueberry, cherry; smooth, round and a good hit,Apple, citrus, grapefruit. Good! "
8519255,"Amazing.  Beautiful colour. Nose of pencil shavings and spice. Silky smooth palate full of dark cherries, blackberry and a hint of nutmeg.  Delightful. ,I’m getting more and more impressed with Taboadella. This one,  for Portuguese conditions, relatively high altitude of 500 m, w loads of granite and silt in a magnum bottle.

8609518,"A sublime example of excellent wine-making. Dry, with deep dark cherry, earthiness, some tobacco, some leather, a trace of spice, and a smooth yet quiet layer of oak. A dead-bang winner. With a few years of aging who knows where this would end up.

A vibrant wine that will get better with age.,(4,2) Amazing clarity and purity here. Very elegant rendering of Touriga Nacional, leaning towards a very floral style. Violets. Rosemary, some vanilla. Black fruit. Excellent freshness.
 Fantastic wine for the price.,Textbook Touriga Nacional giving fresh black and some blue fruit. Just a hint of prunes, black chocolate and lifted violet and grilled spices. Very attractive and classy perfumes. Medium to full body with high tannin and acidity. Sinewy but not unpolished with a warming, medium finish. Needs food. Better from 2023.
