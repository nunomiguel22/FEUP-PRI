80040,4.5,"From a winery founded in 1588, this Vintage Port is sensational. Elegant and balanced with notes of dark cherry, prune, balsamic, eucalyptus, and dried figs. A whiff of fallen leaves tingles the nose. A voluptuous, sensual feel caresses the mouth. Paired with Gouda cheese last night. Yup, I drank this very young and it will be at a good age in 5-8 years and will last for 30. But (1) this is a super vintage year, and (2) I’m a geezer who can’t wait!",DCLaxfan
80040,4.0,"Typically for 2003 this is a voluptuous port, relatively forward for its age. Dense, with black cherry, prune, fig and mocha. The palate is smooth and spicy, rapidly developing more savoury tobacco, tar, anise. It is not overly sweet or acidic. It doesn’t have the magical combination of intensity and complexity that characterise the best vintage ports, and like many 2003s I wouldn’t keep it indefinitely.

1136261,4.0,"Pocas still use foot treading for their Colheita tawnies, with the juice aged in old 625l Portuguese oak barrels. This 1997 is quite woody and spicy. Loads of fruit and flavour, prune and fig richness cut by citrus peel. Tobacco, leather, vanilla. Good length. Very high acidity, but it works in combination with the confident, generous style. Full of personality, and well-priced. I find Pocas a bit hit and miss; this one is a hit 🍷👍",DF

Almost, of course. And about wine only. This tawny juice has Port's aftertaste only! Even 3+ for this. No complexity, no balance and dried plums juice mixed with warm water.

This was the oldest wine I tried and although it was detroned today (see notes tomorrow!) it will always have an emotional connection considering it was put on cask in 1948 (both my parents’ birthyear) and in a bottle in 1974 (my birthyear)! Upon pouring we were very worried about the, Frankly, dirty & ugly light brown color. It turns out this is not so strange according to the ‘aloirado’ description on the label meaning ‘blondish’.🔽🔽🔽🔽",Frederic Knockaert

5376404,3.5,Good surprise. Very mineral and not boring at all. Drinking very well but surely with some potential to age and to develop the more classic Riesling notes which are now just apparent,Joao Vasconcelos

On nose: well balanced, medium minus fruit expression. On mouth: when I try this wine immediately after opening the bottle I notice not so good high acidity.

Legends apart, this is a beautifull fullbodied accid and tannic red that needs at least 3 hours decant to let emerge all his qualities. But then, you will kneel before it. Unfortunately most people rush to open and drink too young ones.   A red for adults!!",Sergio Almeida
2545450,4.5,"An iconic Portugese wine. Dark, slightly turbid red. Fruits in the nose is just felt among some funky aromas of some baked veggies and moderately medicinal aromas.

Fruit is still present, deep plum, damson and a slight bite of cherry - giving that hint of youth. The fruit really works in harmony with savoury forest floor notes and hints of leather and tobacco. If able to, give this an hour in decanter before serving to allow it to open up. Awesome value!",Simon Griffiths
1259564,4.0,"Unique and wonderful wine from Portugal. Dry nose moves onto a cranberry mouthfeel and a really pleasant result. Medium dry, earthy tones and a slightly tart finish. Really impressed by this wine. ",Kevin Costello
1259564,4.0,"👃Baked, spiced figs and dates  👅 The figs and spice are prominent and there are also some slight mocha tastes as well.   Still has grippy tannins after all these years. Nothing overly complex but a real treat!",Alex
1259564,5.0,"Full of life. Tertiary flavours and a definite portyness. A sour red fruit note of cranberry too. Amazed to find that this was made entirely without oak. The blend consists of castelão, baga, and the now extinct varietal moreto.",Malcolm V
1259564,5.0,"Woooey, what a treat! A lively filly with a kick in her step even after 25 years (equivalent to 120 years old in wine years? 🤔). From Bairrada DOC by the Atlantic Coast and made from Baga, Castelão Nacional, Moreto grapes.  Leather, tons of mushroom, juicy blackberry, slate, cranberry + red bean paste, blackcurrant, nutty coconut on the lengthy finish. Enjoyable chewy tannins + zippy acidity holding it all together.  20 min decant. Try if you like old Chateauneuf and old Bordeaux.",Carolyn Feng-Friberg
1259564,4.0,"Interesting and unique red blend with Cabernet  Touriga National and Baga. Baga is a varietal with high tannins and acidity but the age of this one, '95, has tamed the tannins and balanced the acidity. It isn't a fruit bomb but has a great nose of red fruit and earthiness. Really nice wine experience.",DRHelter
1259564,5.0,"Wine tasting - what a faff - but a fun faff. I’ve just tasted 5 different contenders (rated 4 or above) on Vivino and every one fell short - interesting at best, disturbing at worst. So I try to benchmark with this fella (I gave a 5 recently) and it blows every other pretender out the park. For me this is a wine to impress, intrigue and inspire. Understated soft mushroom earthy sexy brilliance. Goddamn - One needs a reference point sometimes for life and art, this brings me home quietly with aplomb.",Joe Coyle

2395325,4.0,"Really interesting wine. The nose isn't too dissimilar to an old Barolo, tar/leather and dried flowers. Palate is nothing like old Barolo hahaha. It's really bizarre, and I'm assuming atypical, but the main fruit characteristic is like this tart stewed plum. Then there is a whole bunch of tannin that comes through. Unbelievable to see this level of acidity, tannin and even salinity from a wine of this age. Anyway that's my rant about the 67",Christian Klinken
2395325,4.5,Fantastic bottle that is full of subtlety. Starts with gravel and fig aromas. Medium texture. As it opens there is just so much more going on. Really enjoyed this,Max Schwaner
2395325,4.5,"It’s an experience to drink this unique Portuguese wine. It should be kept at a cooler temperature and then allowed to breathe in the glass. As it breathes, the flavor opens up so it’s maybe better to start with sips to check out the changes. ",Kay Kim
2395325,4.5,"Earthy notes, tobacco, mint with nice jammy red fruit of cherry and raspberry, remarkable freshness given the age.   Palate was M-F bodies with very supple tannins and good acidity.   Unbelievable given the age",Olli Weisser
2395325,4.5,"A special bottle, took nearly two hours to open properly. Small cork delicately removed in one piece with regular corkscrew. Nose dominated by menthol and forest floor, with still-kicking blackberry, raspberry, plum, black licorice and tight tannins. Saddle leather, cedar. Slight twinge of vinegar needs the fat of a rich meal to cut - paired with a dry-aged Snake River Farms NY strip and was delicious. Rusty garnet color. A big wine with an everlasting finish, if perhaps slightly past its absolute prime. ",Rhys Marsh

83737,4.0,"Enjoyed tasting this port with Churchill’s winemaker Ricardo Nunes.  Certainly the best LBV I’ve ever tasted.  Didn’t realise that LBV aged for this long but this still has legs.  Benefits from being made in a non-vintage year meaning that it gets the better grapes.  Matured in oak vats for four years before being bottled.  2005 was a hot vintage but this is still elegant and fresh.  Herbal notes with spice, black cherry and liquorice on the palate.  Firm tannic backbone.  Drier finish than many ports.",Giles Hannam

6418009,4.0,Happy WWW.  In Lisbon better try their signature white 🍇.  This is Arinto from Alentejo though.  Still south 🇵🇹  The grape using 30%French oak plus on Lees 6 months to add some creaminess to the texture.  Solid mineral acidity flavours in the passionfruit and apricot. Quite a lovely balance and so refreshing.  Oak also brings a little baking spices  Paired with tuna carpaccio while I await my oven roasted octopus 🐙  Solid 4 ⭐️.   So many 🍇 here 🇵🇹 .  So little time.  I gotta pick up the pace 😉,KK

Lots of blueberry, cherry, nutmeg, pepper, and cedar on the nose. Slightly sweet and jammy, pleasant mild acidity, more spiced red fruit, and show-stopping, big, firm tannins. Long finish. Delicious!",Nathan
3652286,4.0,"Lots of potential here but needs five plus years or more to figure out what it’s good for.  Aromas of blueberries, blackberries and black plum. Aforementioned fruits on the palate with some fig and violet.  Not overly sweet at this stage, but a rich and powerful port nonetheless.

Good news, as I wasn't able to fit in a visit to Sandeman in Gaia in October. Sandeman have bucked the trend by not declaring a vintage port in 2017. This young Quinta has a real concentration of fruit, 2017 is such an intense vintage. Deeply coloured and sticky. Leafy, spicy. Palate seems well balanced.

Or yes, store it in the cellar until you can comfortably refer to it as a decade-old vintage.",Matt Gargula

75975,5.0,"Amazing experience to have this 24 year old mate tasting so rich and flavorous. My first time trying such a prestigious (and expensive) wine but it was worth it. It took a while for the nose to show some earthy scents. On the glass, characteristics of an old lady on the color and thick viscosity. The wine itself still had some fruits and a bit of  toasted almond (!!!) ",Eder Coelho
75975,5.0,"Also had this by the glass at the Garrafeira Nacional in Lisbon. Like the Vega-Sicilia, this is also more than special. Complex and intense nose of toasty oak, cherries, sugar kane, spices, grass and herbaceous notes. Great body on it, smooth and elegant. And a great twist on the palate. The sweet and spice tones suggested by the nose, subtly turn exquisitely savoury on the palate with some bitter vegetal notes. Very different than the Vega, but a magnificent wine nonetheless.",Vinny Fardin

1614920,2.5,This did not really hit the spot for me. Seems a bit sharp and has a punch to it. Alcohol is too sharp for my likings. Maybe it has been opened for too long - however this was not my bottle so I am not sure if this has damaged the wine to some extent. Figs with raisin and some fruit but also pepper.,Claus Christensen
1614920,3.5,"[DOC Dinner 4/4] 2️⃣ desserts 🤗😋 so I need a good size glass of port! My 1st from this house & of a nice age so expectations were high. With my nose in the glass they are met with warm intensity, ripe prune, some strawberry, oak and rhubarb. The ball is dropped somewhat in the palate though. The sweetness is kept well under control but more acidity to take advantage would be welcome because it’s a bit austere.

Tasted up against 1968, and it was hard to say which one was better.

9001,4.0,"Another excellent wine from 🇵🇹. Very fine notes of pear lime citrus oak jasmine with a mildly sweet twist. Body was soft, balanced, with moderate acidity and good volume despite the low but refreshing abv.

 On the palate you have a layered expression with a recurrence of most aromas from the nose, combined with a perfect balance of tannins and acidity.  🔽🔽🔽comments🔽🔽🔽",Koen Danhieux
1291873,4.5,"[Vivino Leuven 9/11] @[1|17441025|Koen Danhieux] ▶️ @[1|411157|Dries Thirion] I’m starting to like blind tasting, even if I’m not particularly talented. I like it because it confirms why certain wines made me the wine fan I am. Crasto ‘s Reserva is one of them and this mature one knocked it out of the park!! Meaty nose with cinnamon, coffee, perfect oak, blackberry, black currant and smoke followed by a palate with perfect acidity/tannines balance, plenty black fruit and plum. What a finish also!! 4.6",Frederic Knockaert
1291873,4.5,"This classic Douro Crasto vinhas velhas or reserva is a great Douro red, very consistent and regular year after year.  From a vineyard as age as 70-100 years and a very low production, hand picked grapes and maleolatic fermentation in new french oak barrels for 18 months emerges this complex red.  Great logevity marks this beutifull fullbodied wine made with tipical portuguese grapes of Douro.  Gold/Silver WS 94 Vivino 4,2  Excellent!!!",Sergio Almeida
1291873,4.5,"Wishlisted #9  A wine from my list wisely selected by @Koen Danhieux from  his 2 cases. The time was about right now to start drinking these top bottles. The best field blend I know!   Bordeaux red in colour, nicely looking with a well defined nose of black fruits, caramel, coffee, complexity. The taste starts with a velvet mouthfeel, a lot of power, a lot black fruits, perfect wood, a tad of mint and very refined. Koen will have a lot pleasure with his other 11bottles. Thanks to share this one.  Rate 4,4⭐️",Dries Thirion
1291873,4.5,"Intense aromas of blackberry, black cherry, blueberry, black currant prunes and violet. Balanced, complex, deep texture and elegant structure. Powerful tannins, well integrated in full body with cigar box, fine chocolate and coffee luxurious aromas. Very long finish ",Adrian Butuc
1291873,4.5,"This is in such a good place right now. Much evolved from trying it 3 years ago when it was uneven. Depth and quality of dark old vine fruit shines through. Polished and rather elegant in its structure/tannins with well judged oak that has married the fruit very well. Didn’t decant and drank rather quickly, certainly worth giving it some air to see what complexity of flavour lies underneath. Beautiful texture, balance and finish",James Wills
1291873,4.5,"It’s been one year since I last tasted this wonderful Douro. It seems even better. Lots of matured fruits, flowers, vanilla and spices (black tea and sandalwood). On the palate is dense, a fine texture tannins, balanced. It keeps on the aftertaste the fruits, vanilla, flowers and some tobacco for a long, long time.   Este grande Douro melhora a cada ano que passa. Aromas de frutas maduras, violetas, baunilha e especiarias (chá preto e sândalo). Corpo médio cheio, mas denso, taninos muito finos e equilibra",Raul Vianna

1272205,4.5,"Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: This blend of old vines (75%) and Tinta Roriz (25%) was our favorite. Deep dark red in the glass, it is a powerful, ripe and fruity wine which is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. It‘s really good now, but it has more ageing potential.

1272205,4.0,"Tinta Roriz or tempranillo compared to Touriga Nacional in my book is inferior at least in Douro valley. The style was similar to the reserva of TN but the grape just is not as warm and approachable at the age I was tasting them (3-4 years). Aromas of ripe fruit, cassis and pine buds. Quite robust body with gripy tanins and long finish. I can imagine other people like this better than the touriga nacional. Like comparing Bordeaux right and left banks. :)",Edijs Locmels
1272205,4.0,"75% Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo).  Fire on the nose (spice and alcohol in high intensity), burnt wood, red fruit - something approaching a pomegranate flavor?, fine tannins, high acid, and toast.

4301235,4.0,One of my favourite Portuguese red wines that you can find in one of the biggest discounts in Poland at this very attractive price  point. Another good vintage in my opinion although you will find some completely opposing views on VV which is perfectly normal. Nose of red cherries and oak.

On the palate there are some meaty accents and red berries.  But what’s the big difference? The acidity level! This wine doesn’t has the acidity level as a Burgundy PinotNoir and so it makes everything a bit dull.

2334566,4.0,"4,3. A great white Alentejo. Mature, citrus, pomerans. Bitter almond notes. Good shy minerals. Some gooseberry in the aftertaste. Brought this wine from Portugal to Sweden. Enjoying at the brink to the baltic sea with some fresh shrimps. ",Leif Lindqvist

1162976,4.0,"I have not had a vintage port for a while and by that point of the lunch, we were quite toast... my somm friend thought it would be fun to cut the neck of the bottles with the classic port tongs and a blow torch to warm it up. It worked and came out clean! 5 stars service and delivery. To be honest, by that point I cannot remember the full taste profile of the wine, but I remember liking it... a lunch to remember ",Ben_in_Paris

1162976,4.5,"4,4 stars. At the end of a marathonic blind taste, I was not in condition anymore to take notes on this 33 years old Port.  Nevertheless, the classiness of it was stunningly obvious, with a top notch lushness, that is hard to describe in terms of its outstanding texture, that was mindblowing in conjunction with fresh elegant inky compote berry fruit, plum, fig, liquorice & prunes and a whole load of lovely smooth spices. Acidity easily caught up the sweetness, to make this a balanced luscious gem.",Brennus
1162976,4.5,"Superbly better than the fantastic 82 to a more modern wine, acidity, fruit and everything hangs together in this 32-year-old wine - drink it if you find it! I'm reluctant to use the word umami but there is a almost impossible intangible flavor.",Jackah Gson
1162976,4.5,"93/100 It smells dark and dense, this vintage is incredibly young for its age. Notes of dark plum, black cherry, mocha, and pepper. This is very dense and the tannins are still fierce.

1162976,4.5,"This is a real Vintage Port -  This is Niepoort! Vintage Port is only produced in the best years, 2007 was a really good Port-wine vintage Purple-(red) colour, nearly black Aromas of chocolate, dried herbs, spieces, amarena cherries and vanilla with an oaky touch On the palate complex and concentrated with still young tannins; really smooth with a touch of pepper and berries.  Long finish with a fruity aftertaste and hints of leather Lots of potential- wait another 5-10 years! That's a true Niepoort Port!",Gerardo Corleone
1162976,4.5,"1997 was a stellar port year. And it is showing in this beauty.  Wonderful subtle impressions of dried fruits, raisins, apricots. Some alcohol impressions too.

From a 98 pt vintage, this bottle is packed with thick, chewy flavors!  Dense purple tumbling into the glass, it emits aromas of beautiful violet & blue fruits. Thick but delicate, the palate reveals flavors of blueberry, licorice & cherry cola with silky tannins and a light woody note, all coated in a soft leathery finish that goes on for minutes. Elegant! 93 pts",Scott White
1162976,4.5,"Well balanced and a long length. Silky, full bodied with out feeling jammy or jelly. Nutty nose of candied almond. Light density for a port. Medium acidity. Notes of red cherry, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, raisin, leather. Well structured ",Javier Jimenez
1162976,4.0,"Finale of the tasting at Quinta de Nápoles in Douro. Vintage port can only age in barrels for 2yrs unlike tawny port, so the rest is about what happens in the bottle. Infinitely reasonably priced vs non-fortified wine.  Nose: reductive nose. Great oxidative mushroom contrasts with prune. Marshmallow finish.  Palate: nice tension between the sweetness of concentrated fig, quince+caramelised orange and an acidity that bites. Smooth tannins. This results in an overall elegant, lingering finish.",Takkino Felduchi

Only just showing some garnet reflections, this still has a core of red cherry and plums, with rich spices of cinnamon, pepper, toffee, caramel and mocha. Vintage Port is known for its long aging potential and this is no exception: another 20 years and this will still be singing despite being in a good place right now. Cheers!",Liam Fox

He planted vines of the Baga variety, directly, as was used in pre-phylloxera Europe, in sandy soil.  You need six vines to get one single bottle of this wine. Powerful aroma of ripe red fruits.

4398985,4.0,One of a kind. This single Tinto Cao grape has lots of structure. Although seems very young and quite tannic it will improve greatly if you let it breath. It has really a strange and unique taste. But did conquer me. Aroma interesting and grows on mouth taste.,João Vaz Velho

4398985,4.0,Unusual wine with floral aromas. Refined and complex but the 2013 is young even in 2017 so may need a decade to mature fully. Overall a floral nose and smooth finish. Not the big finish expected at this price point. The finish is quite long and lingers on the tase buds. This wine is a bit of an enigma - not stunning but overtly refined and a sophisticated tipple. Maybe decanting for a few hours more would really open it up.,Mike Manchester

Very aromatic, slightly animalic nose with sweet, ripe prune and black fruit followed by a palate with more prune, tart, enjoyable acidity and perfect tannines. There is quite some sweetness that absolutely doesn’t bother as it is so constructive. There’s also a lot of power and long finish with vanilla and a bitter edge.

It works quite well around 16C, although becomes rather subdued any cooler. Good with some simple salmon noodles.

Rusty nails and forest floor notes in the nose and palate combined with rose petals, wild strawberries, Asian spices, plums and worn leather.

Interesting bottle, especially when you go and get it at the spot :)",Matthijs Hommel

At this stage in development, it’s softly textured—aging in terracotta and cement amphorae, as well as the presence of lees during aging, has graced this wine with ample creaminess at the mid-palate that’s nicely balanced by bright acidity.

This 1977 Fonseca is irresistibly good, boquet of ripe berries, prunes and raisins, taste of mocha, dark chocolate, coffee, and long fruity delicious aftertaste of ripe berries, this is on top now and does not get better just different and even more ripe with longer storage, I think this can last for at least another 40-50 years.  98p",Per G

Black fruit and violet on the nose, slightly medicinal. The palate is sweet, concentrated and tannic. Feels younger than 16 years. Stony, earthy minerals; liqourice and chocolate. Delicious, impressive, validates Noval's decision to make a vintage port. Keep for now; open 2025 onwards. ",DF

Piercingly high orange peel acidity which gives it a very vibrant feel, but will not be to everyone's taste. Noval's 20 Year Old Tawny is easier to drink, but has less personality.

1267265,3.0,Tasting at Quinta de Nápoles in Douro. This red is a collaborative project between Douro's Quinta de Nápoles and Dão's Quinta de Pellada. Combines the ripe structure from 130+yr vines of Douro (60%) with Dão's fresh elegance. Both were fermented in stone Lagares and aged 1.5+yrs in French oak.  Nose: fruit forward with inky heavy black plum dominating.  Palate: dried figs contrast with pomegranate acidity. Medium tannins. Stemmy greenness provides relief from the intensity. Nice acidity toward the end.,Takkino Felduchi

1924186,4.0,What a wonder and a chance to explore some new grape varieties. Have you put Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional on your list? The fun in this region is the small capacity of individual vineyards and the local co-operativa that produce and market a range of wines based on what’s available. It’s highly experimental and characterful wine making. Naturally the majority is consumed locally but the atmosphere is highly collaborative - they share secrets. This is the family’s ‘Big’ wine. Thank you for sharing!,Christopher
1924186,4.0,"I think this is an intriguing wine. It’s main grapes are Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. But blended with Portuguese varieties so it still has that Alentejo terroir.

1175699,4.5,"Spotting this On a Wine List; I thought I was ordering a mistyped Albarino from Spain but when the bottle arrived to the table; it actually was an Alvarinho from Portugal! & This is not your typical light & thin Vino Verde; but a medium bodied Summer white that is an unexpected surprise for any Summer occasion. Zesty Melon like flowers, loads of white pepper and bundles of white shallots with hints of minerality here and there plus balanced acidity. It’s just superb. ",Young Kim
1175699,4.5,"Clear with a green edge on colour. Nose of citrus, herbs and white fruit. On the palate, there is lovely citrus, pinapple and gooseberries (almost sparkling feel to it).

1175699,4.0,"Had this about a year ago and tried another bottle to see if short term aging had some benefit. Often referred to as the ""Green Wine"" of the Vinho Verde region with a concentrated fruit character with notes of pepper spice. Lively acidity gives this wine a zesty boost turning the fruit into a complex dry wine with character, apple and citrus, smooth and well balanced on a lingering finish. Wine developed deeper character, very nice! Great value. A Fav!",Sipping Fine Wine
1175699,4.0,"No. 2’ Wine Pairing 2/7 Would have guess Sauvignon Blanc if tasted blind, but this was a delish Vinho Verde with Alvarinho.   Nose: Stone fruit, grass, citrus, oak.

1175699,4.0,"Nearly 2 years since I last rated this lovely Monção e Melgaço Alvarinho. It only seems to improve. I see there are positive ratings for 20 year old bottles on Vivino! A remarkable wine. Apricot and peach fruit, lime peel acidity, infused with minerals. Dry, intense, elegant and refreshing. Great on it's own, or with seafood.

1240543,4.5,"Without doubt the best still red Portuguese wine I've ever tasted. It smells of caramel, vanilla, black cherries & waffles! The palate delivers smooth tannins & medium acidity. The initial flavours are all about primary fruit enrobed in cream with a finish redolent of something more complex...fennel, rosemary & game.",Wineman Steve
1240543,4.5,"This wine is different, but crazy good. The Bouquet hits you like nothing I have tried before (a mix of Rioja Gran reserva, Barolo and Port). Its oak, vanilla, strawberries with a hint of Caramel 🤔 And its pitch black. Extremely balanced and smooth. The ‘connection’ between Touriga National and Cab is clear, but with almost hints of green pepper (shiraz?) and butter... Clearly the best Portuguese wine I have had (so far)...",Porsgaard

The taste is fresh, but with significant oak. Lemon, yellow apples. It's a bit flatter than the nose, otherwise the score would be higher. This is 4.1.

Finally, everything you buy with this label is exceptionally well crafted. Obrigado! ",Christopher
