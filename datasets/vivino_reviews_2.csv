0,2484848,"A very nice Alvarinho 😊  An interesting fruit (and berry) basket of goosberry, green apple, tomato stem, pear, lime and lemon. All in a medium intensity. High in fruitiness and acidety gives a good balance.  Length is good, balance good. Life is good 😊"
1,2484848,Had this wine in Lagos at the hotel we stayed in ... really a nice wine. 
2,2484848,"Great Alvarinho, loved it. Intense yellowish colour, nose of citrus, but the very ripe sweet lemon. Fresh and elegant, but not overly acidic at all, all really balanced, tasty and long.   Type of wine I could have every day. Very gastronomical too, went great with my burrata. Well done !"
3,2484848,"Very very calm. Excellent balance, light and calm. Fruity. No gas"
4,2484848,"Candied lemon, hay, beeswax, chalky. Doesn't fulfil its promise in the mouth, rather neutral with a slightly bitter end."
5,2484848,"Delicate aromas, very floral, light white melon, crisp acidity, some salinity, subtle elegant flavours "
6,2484848,"✅ Still delivering after 5 years, this Alvarinho made by traditional Quinta de Sanjoanne has a golden yellow colour, still shiny and transparent. Aromas of grilled pineapple, green apples, ripened oranges. Still powerful acidity, flavours are complex mineral nuances, orange zest, peaches in syrup. Finish is dry, long, fresh. 100% Alvarinho, fermented in stainless steel vats followed by aging in steel vats and bottle. Paired with ""bacalhoada"" au gratin.   "
7,2484848,"Citrusy and slightly sweet, smooth. A wonderful wine"

9,2484848,A wonderful surprise. Aged and supreme.

11,2484848,Excellent wine. Very good value for money. 
12,2658364,This wine from alentejo has a soft elegant nose with aromas of red and black fruits; it is full bodied with pro eminent tannins; bold wine with rich notes of forest fruits and high acidity  Moderate length 
13,2658364,"VERONA BELO HORIZONTE MG  3.3 Good QPR. Ruby red colour, mix fruits, compote, spices, polite tannins, good acidity, agreeable finish.

14,2658364,Fine red at the price. Good first taste...but doesn't hold for long.
15,2658364,"I had this wine two years ago. Another bottle after resting in the cellar but In my opinion not better now, although still an excellent wine. A bit more balanced and smooth. Fully recommended. "
16,2658364,"Clear, medium ruby. Clean nose, medium intensity, aromas of strawberry jam, blackcurrant, chocolate, vanilla, toast. Dry. Full body, medium acidity, medium but firm tannins. Flavours of strawberry jam, blackcurrant, chocolate, vanilla, toast. Medium finish. Very good."
17,2658364,Barrel aging clearly notable but doesn't add much smoothness or depth to this wine
18,1722302,Love at first sight.
19,1722302,Very nice full balanced red but with a slight sweet aftertaste that reminded me of Pinot noir even though this was a mix of four grapes and nothing to do with Pinot noir 
20,1722302,"Very nice red blend from Bairrada, Portugal. I got this bottle directly from winery, after relaxing and picturesque ride from Luso. Wine itself consists of 30% Baga, 30% Touriga Nacional, 25% Shiraz and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and it aged 6 months in new oak barrels. It has dark ruby colour, nose is very rich and pleasant, while palate reveals berries. Wine is well balanced and long lasting."

23,1722302,Light.  Tannins not intense.  Light spicy. Good finish.

30,1722302,"Very good, dry and fruit with wood notes "
31,1722302,Had it open for one hour before tasting and it could have had a bit more of time. Intense purple Dão with a leathery
32,1722302,"It is very classy and elegant, with very ripe tannins, powerful black fruits and intense, perfumed flavors. This wine could certainly age for 5–10 years. "

34,2069631,Good and equilibrated. Excellent price value. 
35,2069631,"Lazy Sunday, rainy day... a good day to open a bottle of wine.  👃 mildly spicy, warm, black pepper, red fruit ( strawberry, cherry) and vanilla notes.  The body is extremely light, but it’s good regardless, balanced, low acidity and a moderate aftertaste.  I was excited it to be more bold because of the year but I guess since it’s organic, that might have a impact. "
36,2069631,"Red fruit notes on the tongue, high tannins. A bit too rough for my taste. "
37,2069631,Lovely after a tough week on a lockdown Friday. 
38,2069631,"3.5-5. dark purple with nose of red fruit and pepper. Medium body, tannin and acidity. Dryish with a little chewiness. Wnba."

40,2069631,"Nice taste of red fruit and citrus fruit, but a little bit on the tannic/acidic side. Not very complex. It goes along quite well with a vegan Bolognese pasta."
41,2069631,Open taste. More fruity than Tempranillo grapes. Less tannins. 
42,2069631,"Incredibly deep purple, candied fruits with some holiday spice on the nose. Drinks thin, easy. Low complexity, cherry, vanilla, Ash, doesn't linger. Pretty simple wine, no complaints from plum's <$20 picks. "
43,2069631,"Delicious floral notes. Old world earthiness with a classic Port red blend flavor profile.  Composed of a field blend of estate fruit: Touriga Nacional (45%) Touriga Franca (25%) Sousão (20%) Tinta Roriz(5%) Tinta Cão (5%)  Deep dark purple! Faint nose of red cherry and soil.  No mistaking these grapes! Hearty red fruit, raspberry, blackberry, and subtle meat and slate, but mostly fruit driven. A surprising amount of acidity and a med full body.  A nice drinking wine with or without food at a good price.   "

47,2069631,Strong herbal notes to start then flushing out with hints of plum and mineral deposits in the finish.
48,1744679,A vivid dark violet from Douro with a nose on cherries and berries. The palate has volume and solid but non aggressive tannins. A pleasant surprise in this less known wine.
49,1744679,"Deepest evil purple - lots of long, stringy legs - tight hints of grape in the nose - big in the mouth - wild dark berries - nice rough edges - a bit of a bruiser, but an honest, easy, and pleasant drink - reasonable finish - good value. 4 hour decant. 14.5%.

59,1744679,"@ PORTUGAL VACATIONS - 2018 - In this cozy restaurant in Ovar center I tasted this very interesting daily wine from “Tras os Montes” region. Limpid and intense red color. Nose marked by fresh red fruits as strawberries and blackberries, rounded up by vanilla and spices. In mouth, good body with powerfull tannins well integrated in the ellegant fruity flavors. Good lasting with exciting aftertaste. Paired well with my codfish migas lunch. Cheers! "

62,1744679,Smooth and nice red fruits
63,1894092,Quite surprised by this one. I bought this nice red at a simple supermarket at gorgeous Castelo de Vide. Full body though still fruity with a nice bouquet. Smooth and enjoyable. 
64,1894092,Fruity very enjoyable wine we enjoyed with veal and padron peppers.  Easy to drink once it aerated for a bit
65,1894092,"Achei o nome diferente, mas aí lembrei da banda, belo vinho.  Different name, came from the rock band, nice wine."
66,1894092,"Fruity, medium to heavy body with a round finish. Cherry and other berries. A finish quite unlike other Alentejo wines."
67,1894092,"Nice wine! Red fruits, blueberries, nice acidity and concentration. Go Xutos!"
68,1894092,"So finally the celebrity wines have found its way to Portugal! this is itself a very good music group that this wine carries it’s name from- unfortunately despite the interesting grape mixture you can’t say the same about the wine... A little bit too short, alcohol in front of the mouth at 13.5% - it is a little flat despite what seems to be proper work in the vineyard."
69,1894092,"Great berry fruited flavours, dense and enjoyable. Not bad for that price! True alentejo but smoothe"
70,1894092,"An interesting a drinkable wine. Medium in body, leggy, a lot of sweet dark fruit, very tannic.  Smells like port."

79,1197707,"Wood in aroma, like appasimento"
80,1197707,"Fruity, with hints of plum and red fruits. Extremely sweet, and therefore it needed to integrate a little more acidity. The worst part is that the wine is already past its prime. If you have it stored,  drink it now."
81,1197707,A random holiday purchase from a supermarket in Portugal. Lovely smooth slightly smokey hit with a decent finish. Not sure on price I think it was about €8 - something of a bargain for s quaffing BBQ wine

89,1504338,"Finally a big gun comes out after so many other wines.. What a beauty! 👀Deep ruby in colour 👃Pronounced nose of blackberry, plum and black cherry with beautifully intertwined oaky vanilla with touches of raisin some crushed gravel 👄Pronounced on the palate with black fruit and sour cherry with some earthy minerality and big spice to a looooong finish. Luxurious and rich with big grumpy tannins and high acidity! 8 years young requiring another 15 at least! What a beast! 4.3🌟 and only getting better "
90,1504338,"Black berries, chocolate. Sensation!"
91,1504338,"Heavy and ok nose for a Portugese Duoro, but little nuance and complexity"

96,1504338,"Super good red from Barrida. Touriga National and Touriga Franca. Full bodied, chocolate, red fruit. A beautiful blend of fruit, acid, tannin. One of the best Portuguese red I ever tried(and I tried many😜). "
97,1504338,Wine Meeting Bacozon 30/05/2019
98,1504338,"Waw, this is it, all you expect from a great wine, after de anting a very soft start, chocolate and spices, ripe red fruit but incredible finish!"

102,1504338,A powerfull wine. Open and let it breathe for 20 minutes!
103,8348940,"Shiny yellow. Aged in oak barrels for 3 months. Straw, citrus and yellow garden fruits nose. Vegetal palate with dominating lemon taste. Smooth, balanced, hint of minerality, bitter finish. I expected more for a reserva, I’m either not in the mood or the wine is average 😉🥂"
104,6349654,"Dark garnet color. Proper and black currant. Fresh due to acidity. Too much presence of tannins for Syrah, in my opinion. "

108,6349654,"Wines of Portugal, June 10 - wine fair - quick notes - simple, high acidity."
109,6349654,Above average for price range. 
110,6349654,"Advantages: very good value, very affordable in my region. Complex fruity nose with blackberry and blueberry, heaps of smoke, tobacco, licorice, allspice, with a palate of salinity, like salty, rocky, smoky, tannin. Definitely bites, and could use some age. I wasn’t as much of a fan as some others, I thought the body was medium and the finish was medium, which for a warm climate Portuguese Syrah, I thought would be stronger. Well balanced overall and nice flavors for a good price point. Not a standout."
111,5264080,The best wine all of the world

149,80415,"A treat. Figgy, syrupy and unctuous. But there’s still an acidity that lightens the whole deal. 40 years and more old - luckily the cheese - Picos blue, Stilton, Cotherstone, and Mont d’Or, none of it approaching the same age, all helped it across the road. "

170,76378,"4.5 92p. Nice and complex bouquet with dried apricots, honey, nuts, cherry sauce and oak. Really nice palate with complex notes of dried fruit and oak on a well balanced acidty and a honyed sweetness.  Choose 1966, 1985 or 2006, if you want to optimize QPR.  11-"

178,76378,If you want excellent Colheita Port - you can always count on Burmester to deliver 👌🏻
179,76378,31 years old port = great expectations 😋 however this did not quite live up to these expectations. Very light brownish color. In the nose nuts and sweet fruits - same goes for the palate. But it seemed to be a bit thin in every way. Don’t get me wrong this is a very yummy port - but I expected a bigger and more memorable experience.
180,76378,"Not sure what has happened to this one, but it’s like the power has disappeared. It’s almost hollow"
181,76378,Not convinced about the quality of Burmester
182,76378,Amazing. Taste of mild honeyed port wine. The best one I've ever tried.
183,76378,"Beautiful dark orange-brown color with reddish hints. Brilliant clarity.  The aroma is acidiously fresh and vibrant with notes of orange peel, kumquats, raisins, prunes and brown sugar.  The alcohol is a little intrusive right after opening - with a vauge turpentine note. Tastes great with juicy-sour, ripe fruit and sweet, fatty caramel. Long aftertaste. Yum! "
184,1135751,"Very good entry level vintage Port. Prune, blackberry jam, walnut, caramel. Excellent pairing with Stilton blue cheese and with 75% dark chocolate. 😍"
185,1135751,"First experience with a VP, and it's a great experience! Deep dark red color, lots of fruits and power.. Great wine now, but you can easily taste the potential of this wine also!"
186,1135751,"Like a good rich MF filling Amarone... O Is it a Port, nice any way!"
187,1135751,"A blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and Sousão from Porto, Portugal. Blackberry, plum, dried apricot, raisin, blueberry, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, coffee. Very Long aftertaste. Fruit-driven, rich, nutty, creamy and aromatic. Nice Port."
188,1135751,Supposed to be one of the best vintage of the decade but this bottle was off oxidized and corked notes #portwineday #winelover
189,1135751,Great porto. 20 percent of alcho ! Grapes from the Cima Corgo in the Duro Valley. Two year in the oak casks. Intense aroma os red plums.

191,1135751,"Delightful, but still a baby!"
192,1135751,Good try for a Nice Wine. Can be stored for Many years. 
193,1135751,Amazing value. Bought it ages ago for nothing and it is a stunner. Light brown colour like liquid caramel. Nose is all nuts and intensity. Really increasing your expectations. 
194,1135751,"Red fruit, cinnamon, mint, black pepper. Not perfectly balanced but pleasant and quite complex: 4"
195,1135751,"Dark ripe cherry, plums, vanilla, forest floor, smokey notes. Very lovely aromatics.  Red berries, plum/cherry, wood, vanilla, tødry, tart finish. Deep wine not too complex but nice challenging nuances nevertheless.  Nutty notes. 91+"
196,1135751,"93/100 From the 2016 Port Vintage declaration tasting. Red fruit, raspberry, pepper, and firm tannins. This isn't as accessible as others in the vintage but it is nicely structured and has a long life ahead of it. "
197,1135751,"A lovely port. Very fruity, very sweet, with tastes of dark cherries, with a long aftertaste. It has developed a lot since the last time I tasted it, and to the better "
198,1135751,Eye: Vintage red with a brown touch. Nose: Classic vintage honey. Mouth: Fine sweetness with a round end.  A fair bottle.
199,1135751,Great Port wine! Perfect match for well-made desserts.
200,1135751,"Vanilla, wood, black cherry, blackberry. A hint of tertiary notes like fig and caramel.   Lovely dark fruit, black fresh cherry, plenty of tannin, vanilla, wood, a hint of caramel and fig. Fresh finish, lots of  black ripe fruit, wood and vanilla. Lovely! 91"
201,1135751,Nice port. Not quite as powerful as expected.
202,1135751,Balsamico taste. Not pleasent. Not sure if faulty. 79 points

206,1135751,Very  nice. Value for the money. Happy to have some more in the cellar. Dark and very good rich taste .

210,1135751,Nothing spectacular comparing to other '97 vintage ports but pleasant loaded with forrest fruit and still some edgy tannins in a positive sense.
211,1135751,Early start to test the Ris A La Mande. Perfect fine tannin and acidity to balance The sweetness
212,1135751,Perfect to drink now
213,1135751,"Good port. Goes well with sweet dessert, a bit on the sweet side by itself. Good blackberry and cherry. "
214,1155199,"Bottled 1985. Quite developed nose with hints of dried violets, dried apricots, wet forest floor, prunes and plums. Medium + acidity and medium tannins rather well balanced and full bodied. Tobacco, acacia honey, stewed blackberries, blueberry marmalade and chewy liquorice caramel.  Very different but very good. "
215,1155199,"Lack acidity, acetone and candied peel. 83 points"
216,1155199,Excellent portwine with very silky taste.
217,1155199,Be careful with temperature. It is most tasty at 16. At higher temperatures is starts to be much worse. 
218,1155199,87 pts garnet red delicious dried fruits very concentrated in the mouth alcohol a bit to dominant probably a bit to old??
219,1155199,"Life’s short and the number of surprises poping here and there is fairly limited. Why not enjoy every of them, at the fullest."
220,1155199, brown sugar red fruit vanilla
221,1155199,Everything but plum!
222,1155199,Very nice port. Nose of nuts and prune. Full body of raisins and brown sugar.
223,1155199,Grape. Wine. Balsamic. Graze. Strawberry/ Grape. Red fruit. High tannins
224,1155199,20 year old Vintage Port and Stilton on Christmas day. Wonderful.
225,1155199,"Sweet, fruity. Has raisins both in the smell and taste. It’s nice company for chocolate."
226,1155199,"Understand now the value of well evolved Porto. Totally different from anything this century, clear and strong. Pure. Buy this if you find it somewhere..."
227,1155199,"Incredible Port. 2011 was reportedly an outstanding year for Port so I had high expectations.  The nose is a bomb of flavours, hints of dried fruit like prunes, raisins, dried fig. Also notes of plum and dark fruit. "
228,1155199,Some of the best I have had 🍷
229,76390,Typical port but a little less syrupy than I would have expected.  Cork breaking into the bottle didn’t help
230,76390,Excelente vinho do Porto!!! Viva Portugal!!
231,76390,"Interesting notes of violet, cherry, mushrooms, forest, nuts."
232,76390,"Great taste, but it could last longer.. Okay color also.."
233,76390,light and mild. should probably not be very many more years in the cellar 2015 very good
234,76390,"Very nice port, with a lot of floral and fruit flavours.."
235,76390,"Still good, red colour. Very subtle nose of decaying berries, pepper and mint. Quite sweet with very good acidity and nice tannic reserve. For a so-so house this is a surprisingly good effort in a difficult year. 92p"
236,76390,"Multi grape port wine from older vintage and still at decent price and with rich notes of cherries, chocolate and oak - and with an interesting “cheesy” hint (kind of sweet cheese). Good acidity and nice, nice."
237,76390,Nice glas of tasty and balanced Wine bringing back memories of an good old friend 
238,76390,Very nice as a chilled aperitief
239,76390,"Caramel, dried fruit and fig. Deep ruby color. Balanced. Medium sweet. Long finish"
240,76390,"Still good, drunk July 2016."
241,76390,"Well balace between fruit and acid. And tanics. Raissin, tobacco and chocolate and hint of caffe. Very well aged in the Bjørklund-cellar."
242,76390,Again a really very fine vintage port in all senses. 
243,76390,"Caramel, raisin, fig, prune, smoke, vanilla."
244,1189822,"While many prefer vintage or 20,30,40 year old tawny’s my favorite is by far colheita   Made only in the rarest of quality vintages you get the IMAX 3D expression of port wine   Dark amber in color with waves of hazelnut and apricot notes The mouthfeel is clearly fortified wine with a molasses thick consistency  On the palate is the warm prune, fig, hazelnut all rounded and smooth like no other wine  95pts"
245,1189822,"wow. almonds, sawdust, leather, dried fruit, on nose. dirt caramel color with a full mouth feel. same on taste with vanilla, butterscotch and caramel.  Very elegant."
246,1189822,This is drinking perfect right now!
247,1189822,"A 1985 vintage Colheita that was a bit of a disappointment. Unclear amber color. A bit mute on the nose with scents of figs and dried fruit. Very sweet and very much alcohol, almost a burning feeling. I will stop there.    "
248,1189822,"Since Para was gone, we replaced it with this beautiful Barros and paired with Vaniglia del Madagascar ice cream😍😍 Big cheers my friends🍷🍷"
249,1189822,"Perfect Colheita from a year which has a certain aura. Intense amber colour with most intriguing tears in the glass. Full and concentrated nose, dominated by a multitude of dried fruits, some spicy notes of rose pepper, cedar wood, and a subtle touch of vanilla. Extremely refined in the mouth, elegant, with a notable character and a pleasant freshness, helped by prevalent tannins. Long and persistent finish, extremely well masked alcohol - I almost fell in love - but alas, she's gone now. "
250,1189822,"Születésnapomra I.  What a wonderful surprise I got today! Couldn't have antecipated such a fabulous treat. Such a fine gem.  Port wine is not really my thing, I confess. Yet. Could never really comprehend its soul. Maybe this one's a switch.  Within a fabulous aged amber hue, a perfectly conserved nectar flows. Elegantly alive, conveying honey dew coated figs, orange peel sprayed up dried fruits, in a full silky, stable and nostalgic path. And I liked this. Liked it a lot. Bottled in 2014 and born in 1984."
251,1189822,"Surprising color, light brown with some spark in it. Nose is probably biggest surprise with pleasuring tones of dry fruits, figs, raisins, prunes, apples and honeyed walnuts. It could remind you some great aguardente with an oriental spices. Then the palate is turning you back to wine world with silky and smooth taste, with finish just opening your fantasies."
252,1189822,"A wonderful very old Tawny again 😃 candied citrus notes, grilled nuts, sweet spices - beautiful wine with great balance and nice acidity 🍷 a must try "
253,1189822,"(95/100) Fabulous Port Wine!!!  Fig and nuts on the nose and explosive on the mouth, with caramel and almonds. Sweet but the acidity holds everything together!!"
254,1189822,"Very good.  Burnt orange colouring.  The nose is sugar cane, Christmas cake.  The palate is superb.  Good balance at this age.  Has weight, sweet caramel, soft spices.  Rated 4.3.  At $70 it’s fair."
255,1189822,"Apricots, figs and brown sugar. Nutty flavors from oxidation. Taste of hazelnuts,  not too sweet, with a refreshing acidity. Although sweet , aftertaste is somewhat dry. Great port, ready now"
256,1189822,Very faded brown color. On the nose typical port scents of figs and almonds. Lean and elegant on the palate with a subtle alcohol kick at the end. A very nice port indeed.
257,1189822,"Excellent Port, chocolate, nuts and almost a bit of sherry taste after so many years in the cellar. A fantastic wine to enjoy now "
258,1189822,"A dense golden port with a nose on nuts, flowers and roasted coffee beans. Powerfully attack with volume, flavor and magnificent final. Still young after 30 years."
259,1149238,Figs plums great wine 
260,1149238,Dense dark red fruity Berry nose. Velvet tannins. Grippy acidity. M Teeth drying out Dry sensation. Sweet red fruity taste. Dense after taste. 
261,1149238,"Deep ruby red colour. Very dense, sweet nose of dark berries, raspberry confit and sweet cherries. On the palate impressively dense and concentrated, good acidity and long complex finish. Needs some more time of course!"
262,1149238,"Cardamon and nutmeg light nose, palate is very well blended in a dense complex mix of flavors with baking spices and blueberry notes"
263,1149238,Lots of currant and dark ripe berries.  Nice full bodied Porto with a good level of acidity and a smooth silky finish.  Cheers!
264,1149238,Pretty floral note on top of a frame of bright plum tones. Rich and sweet with dark berries and cherries on the palate. Vibrant acidity provides a good back bone.
265,1149238,"Beautifully balanced port with perfect sweetness that elevates the berry aromas and leading vanilla hued finish. First time drinking a port from this house, and pretty impressed."
266,1149238,"Amazing taste and body!! Drink alone, with dessert or whatever 🥳"
267,1149238,"Eyes: Deep purple  Nose: Intense aromas of fig, cassis, blackberry, licorice, bouquets of clove, nutmeg, vanilla  Palette: Sweet, high acidity, medium tannin, full-bodied, long finish"
268,1149238,"Pocas is far from my favorite Port brand, but I must say that this LBV is really not too bad. If you are into LBV's you can easily buy this. It has all that a classic LBV can offer."
269,1149238,Complex and elegant. Loads of chocolate and blackfruit marmalade. Rich and fairly concentrated. Tannins are finely grained but not very well integrated alcohol.I assume that needs time to age.
270,1149238,"I seldom drink portwines but today it felt like a good idea to accompany the cheesecake and strawberry sorbet. A very nice combination. Taste of chocolate, oak and vanilla + plum. Also a slight scent of coffee.."
271,1149238,"This is a style of Late Bottled Vintage that should be aged. It has great red and black fruits at this stage but will develop a more structured, dense and firm character as it matures. Give this well-made, juicy wine with its sweet black fruits at least until 2017."
272,1149238,"Port night was great!  Clear, deep, garnet color. Clean, medium+ intensity aromas of Corinthian raisins, cherries, cloves and black chocolate. Sweet, low+ acidity, medium tannins and full body. Long finish. Very good."
273,1149238,"Haven’t gone back to this bottle in a while, it is still deep inky like a port should be, sweet plum and dark fruit, fig, raisin and light oak.  This might be on the sweet side - even for a port, but I like it."
274,1266123,Showing some aging characteristics in the nose. More of a reductive note with a big bournon and rum like nose. The oak is subtle in the palate with a good balance on acidity/fruit. Warm finish. Drink soon
275,1266123,Rich full bodied with long lasting mellowness. Delightful 
276,1266123,"Decanted then exhibiting light ruby hue with golden rim. Nose of ripe preserves of fig. First sip just fills your sinuses with hints of dark chocolate, mint and figs. A mellow long finish. Excellent!"
277,1266123,Has a nice alcoholic and caramels' note on the palate. Gets less string after breading for some minutes. Very strong and nice on the nose. A very enjoyable vintage Oporto wine. Nothing to go wrong here :)
278,1266123,"When I tried to open the bottle,  the cork broke. I was quite disappointed because my expectations were high. So I managed to uncork the rest. At first I thought that this wine was bouché, but when I poured it in a glass, this port revealed its nature. A nose of nuts and warm sweetness. At the palate : still a lot of acidity.  Great port."
279,1266123,"Had some after work at a colleague's house yesterday afternoon,   Producer Real Companhia Velha, to my understanding the oldest wine company in Portugal  On the nose dried fruit, molasses, sweet tobacco, cherry, nuts and sweet kitchen spices. On the palate figs, nuts, raisins, cheery, cracked black peppercorn, orange chocolate, syrup and salty caramel   Well, had several good wines last night so notes and the experience are slightly cloudy. 4,3⭐"
280,1266123,"Prune, honey, and caramel. Very sweet, which is not typical for vintage port. Interesting color: almost ruby in electric light, dark tawny in natural. Excellent."
281,1266123,"🇵🇹 4.6 Memorable Port.    This was a gift fro my late step-dad, Jaime Novoa, thank you viejo!   Beautiful caramel color with very slow moving legs.  Chocolate, leather, macerated raisins on the nose.  Just wonderful flavors of chocolate, honey, balsamic vinegar, raisins, Saúde 🍷🍷🍇"
282,1266123,Now that's an old wine.  Musty looks and classic aromatics with lots of sugar to mask any residual defect. Decent Porto featuring long snd warm finish.
283,1266123,"Amazing Port.  So soft, smooth, rich, integrated and balanced taste. 🔝 Bought and imported in 1985 by my father while we where in Porto. Has been resting since then! 👍 Saude! 🍷"
284,1266123,Once upon a time I was the officer responsible for the Officers Mess wines etc. I bought a lot of Port. This is a very good example of a vintage port. Unfortunately these wines are now beyond my pocket in most cases but this bottle was most enjoyable.
285,1266123,"Deep purple hue. Cherry, black cherry, and cassis. Oak, chocolate, and caramel. It has notes of spices and tobacco with a lingering finish. It is starting to change my mind about vintage port vs tawny."
286,1266123,"Excellent mature Vintage Porto,  from vintage 2007,  a medium garnet-brow color,  with brick rim.  Nose: pronounced  caramel, mocha, baked almonds, hazelnut, walnuts, sweet spices, star anise, dried fruit, fried cherry, dried plum, dried fig, dates, golden raisins, candied orange peel, dried apricots, honey nuances, cedar, tobacco, cigar box, Wine full body, elegant, smooth, with great balance between sugar, fruitiness and acidity, nice velvety texture, complex. Finish very long, elegant, sophisticated."
287,1266123,"4.9 WIP, it has everything"
288,1266123,"Waow, what a port Lots of essens and volume  Notes of blackcurrant and heavy berries Straight to the heart....."
289,2402435,Still Young and a bit agressive
290,2402435,"Great, 5 years after its producing. I think it could improve even more with age."
291,2402435,"Let's be honest , it's an ok Moscatel from Douro, but nothing more. "
292,2402435,"Red fruit, less tannin. High alcohol, high acid"
293,2402435,"A Portuguese red blend that’s value driven.  Deep garnet in color with earthy notes of dark fruit   Medium/full bodied with a tart fruit expression.  Tannins are gripping and the acidity is fair.  Super dry mouthfeel tilts the wines balance.   On the palate it’s black cherry, red currant and licorice  86pts"
294,2402435, red fruit chocolate cherry
295,2402435,Adulto. Taninos suaves.
296,2402435,Ripe dark berries. Balanced and pleasant tannins. A little wood smoke and chocolate. And good with cheeses and meat 
297,2402435,"Slightly dry with nice notes of dark berries. Easy to drink, nice with cheese."
298,2402435,"Very good, smooth! "
299,2402435,"3.2@Quinta Pacheca Douro. Wine pairing lunch, 2/3. Paired with baby goat. Fruity, bit rough, young, enjoyable."
300,2402435,"Regular table douro wine, pretty smooth if you let it breath, bought in Portugal it's a good value for the money. The terroir is definitely a Douro slopes one."
301,2402435,Surprisingly fruity and pleasantly Douro. I loved visiting this winery and the variety of wines and the hospitality. Would love to find this more available in the US. 
302,2402435,"Great value, lovely refined and elegant!"
303,2402435,"Nice but trivial, black fruit, little red fruit, and very little oak..."
304,4995848,"Very (x2) nice well balanced wine. Red fruit, just enough acidity ...smooth"
305,4995848,"Deep purple, garnet rim. Nose of dried scrub vegetation, dark chocolate, menthol, blueberries and pomegranate. Dry, medium acidity and (building) tannins, medium (+) alcohol. Pomegranate, dark chocolate and black cherry on the palate.   Generally, this wine seems short in its bulk of complexity. Blind, I wondered if it was past it's prime. Although, I truly think the void in this wine is its deficit of structure (specifically either elevated acidity or tannins) and their age-worthy benefits. Moving on..."
306,4995848,"A lot of menthol, fruits and lighter then the others? Haha strange since it’s gran reserva lol 😂 enjoyed and I recommend to try them all! 🇵🇹😄"
307,4995848,"Expovina tasting. Very.good, with its sweet residue it reminds a bit of amarone."
308,4995848,Produced the old fashion way... 15% and my fav red grapes... What else do we need more?
309,4995848,"Very nice deep violet color with great tearing. A full bodied red with hints of red berries, cherry and prunes. Dry finish that pairs well with red meat, fatty fish and seafood, game and strong cheese. "
310,4995848,"Dark in all matters... color, nose and mouth deep dark choclate, blueberries and tobaco - nice wine, still young"
311,4995848,"Very dark ruby color, plum, black fruit, some smoke. Dry and long finish..."

314,2864107,"Full bodied, with medium acidity and soft tanins. Notes of blackberry, cassis, plum, vanilla, leather, menthol. A bold but elegant wine. "

319,2864107,"Savory, full, and great mouth feel"
320,2864107,"Jammy and full bodied Tinto leaving tasting notes from blackberry, cassis, tobacco and oak. High on alcohol and very rich in taste 💪🏻🇵🇹"
321,2864107,"The Castelão, with a superior, most magnificent nose.. A mate of mine wanted to try a wine from the southern coast of Portugal, not Dão which is what we had prior to this bottle. A mix of dark and red fruit.  Ripe tannins that guarantees furtherageing potential than the 5 years we had before opening."
322,2864107,"The wine aged for 12 months in new French oak barrels and another 6 months in the bottle before its release . The bouquet shows souvenirs of dark forest berries, roasted coffee notes, scrub and dry wet clay. Dense and well concentrated in the mouth with present but already smoothed tannins , it finishes dry, a little austere and very intense. "
323,2864107,"Medium to deep ruby red colour. Some evolution on the nose, slightly balsamic, walnut, dried fruit, wood and tobacco, medium bodied palate, youthful texture with a tannic backbone, red fruity notes and a spicy finish with pepper and clove. Traditional style for long ageing. "
324,2864107,Nice and tasty. Bananas and (slightly) coffee
325,2864107,"Castelão. Earthy with notes of minty eucalyptus...Ruby brown medium intense color, aromas of eucalyptus wood and dried leaves, autumn and tobacco. Flavours of dried spices, cardamon, nutmeg and dried red fruits. Medium volume and discreet acidity... Still young ...Bit pricy..."
326,2864107,Luscious Flavour if red fruit
327,2864107,Reminds me of Bordeaux.
328,2864107,"dark cherries, smoke, and wood. Good but not as deep as I hoped for. "
329,2046423,Good wine not expensive
330,2046423,"Really sweet, excellent picnic wine and not too expensive. Is it Apple I taste as after taste? "
331,2046423,"3.5⭐ for this Alentejo white wine. Good aroma focused on mineral, citrine, some spice and melon. In the mouth dry, acid and fresh with notes of mineral. Short persistence in the mouth with good structure. Elegant wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🥂"
332,2046423,Fruity with apple bouquet 
333,2046423,"Hints of melon and apricot. Extremely refreshing little Alentejan, would drink again! "
334,2046423,"Worth trying, fresh and light. Should be tried outside."
335,2046423,"citrus 5-spice powder citrus Good with grilled spicy grilled fish,Cameroon style"
336,2046423,There is better from Alentejo at the same price.
337,16385,"First impressions are that this wine is one grassy mama. Bit average for $14 a pop though.   Citrus of the lime variety, bit of Pear. Not shabby but probably won't go again."
338,16385,"Light, fresh, nice."
339,16385,Definitely better the next day!
340,16385,"Another great table wine. Dry, mineraly and hasn’t been within a thousand kilometres of an oak barrel. "
341,16385,Light and fresh- lemon and melon An easy drinking afternoon wine 
342,16385,Sampled with shrimp and seafood risotto by the beach at Praia das Macas. Blissful setting and not a bad rose either. Dry and meaty with crisp finish 
343,16385,"Portuguese blend of varieties I never heard about: Malvasia fina, Siria and Gouveo, from high altitude vineyards, in stainless steel. Pale lemon. Discrete nose. Ample, fat. Slightly bitter. Enough minerality and freshness to stand against seafood."
344,16385,"Medium bodied white with lush acidity and notes of crisp Green apple, lime zest, pineapple, cantaloupe and dill, which follow through on the palate with a bit of mineral, Flint/limestone and ginger spice. "
345,16385,Palacio Mateus in during Portugal 
346,16385,"Light, pale yellow, dry, lime"

348,16385,"Citrus, fresh and delicate"
349,16385,Fruty and nice white wine with clear teast of green apple and melon. Three grape is blended and the aroma is a bit difficult to smell. Good to cheese and long fruty aftertaste 
350,16385,"Vacations @ Fernando de Noronha, lunch on board of Trovão dos Mares (thunder of the seas).  Medium yellow color, tropical fruits flavors, mineral notes, medium- acidity, fresh.  Paired with shrimp moqueca.  Rate 3.5"
351,16385,"A solid value white   A Light fruitful, aromatic, lychee, melon nose.   The pallet is well balanced & cheek filling chompy tropical fruit body with good length dried lemon, yellow melon lime.   An easy summer friend.!"
352,1170226,3.9 Excellent structured Portugués red blened. 6 months in French oak. Medium to full bodied  Blackberry chocolate oak Highly recommended !!!!! Love ❤️ 
353,1170226,"Round pine qualities: spruce shoot syrup, light rosemary and juniper parallel to strong fruity aromas of cherry and dark fruit. Dark chocolate and some sugary candy fumes that extend to the pallet, the wine is somewhat sweet but not unctuous. Thankfully it is also zesty and firm. Having said that the wine is still comparatively lean. "
354,1170226,Nice one! With oak vanilla chocolate black fruit dark fruit blackberry cherry strawberry raspberry 🍷🍷🍷
355,1170226,Sweet initially and then it’s gets nice and dry. Good value for money  black fruit oak
356,1170226,"Excellent Choice for the price. Not so dry, but tannic and intense. "
357,1170226,"Nice red rubi, intense and well bodied. Fruity and notable chocolate, this wine has strong character despise it's softness on the palate. It's a bit sweet and smoky, perfect for special occasions."
358,1170226,"I love the muskiness taste at the initial note, smooth soft touriga on the taste bud, and a little mixture of other grapes. Love it. "
359,1170226,Very sweet at beginning and a bit bitter at the end
360,1170226,"Crisp, apple goodness "
361,1170226,"Nice Portuguese red, loads of boack fruit and good balance, very good QPR."
362,1170226,3.5 dark fruit black fruit oak vanilla 
363,1170226,Has good vanilla taste. Not too sticky or sweet. 
364,1170226,"Red fruit, spicy, full body and 14,5 witch is more than full body. "
365,1170226,"Quite good on the palate with a take away burger for sure, acidity on the medium side a little smoothed out with that black fruits blackberry pleasent on the nose.  Still very young and underrated grape blend. "
366,1170226,"Good, smoky oaky pepper smell and taste with proper body and acid so good"
367,4386655,"Light and fresh, lavender notes?"
368,4386655,not overly fruity an a sharp taste. Okay for a cheap bottle for mid week drinking. 
369,4386655,"Frutado, final agradável. Boa surpresa."
370,4386655,Tried during Zurich Wine Festival 2021 (Switzerland)
371,4386655,"3,6⭐ Pale straw colour. Tropical fruits, pineapple, honey and apples aromas. Nice balance. Med low acidity. Apples, grapefruit and herbs on the palate. Pleasant herbal finish."
372,4386655,"Crisp, light tasty wine, best served chilled. Delicious with seafood"
373,4386655,🇵🇹 almoço com a família. Branco do Alentejo. Acompanhou umas francesinhas. Leve. Agradável.  🇬🇧 Lunch with the Family. White wine from Alentejo. Paired with francesinhas. Light. Nice wine.
374,4386655,"Fruty, easy to drink especially during summer "
375,4386655,"Pineapple, touch vegetable, fresh. "
376,4386655,Not the best 
377,1368329,Very leathery and earthy.. loved it 
378,1368329,Dry and pairs well with pistachio ice cream 
379,1368329,~3.5... Mediocre and one-dimensional oaky black fruity... Totally lacking any acidity... Worthwhile to skip...🤦🏻‍♂️
380,1368329,"Round and charming, silky tannins, velvety and powerful at the same time "
381,1368329,Nice easy structure with no oak... Nice with every penny!
382,1368329,"Quite heavy tears, dark berries in nose, nice rusty taste and feel, good balanced tannins, fine structure"
383,1368329,"Seriously deep purple, at 14% this packs a serious punch - rounded fruits - interesting back notes, and a long finish - worth trying again in a few years, I think."
384,1368329,Great value for money.
385,1368329,Easy drinking with heavy jam
386,1368329,"Spicy, smooth, lighter, you can taste the varietals in the blend. Nicely balanced. My first taste of the Douro valley...I'll be back for more!!"
387,1368329,"Medium ruby Portuguese blend.  25% Touriga Nacional, 25% Touriga Franca, 25% Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), and 25% Tinto Cáo.   Aged entirely in stainless steel, so no oak.  Black fruit aromas like blackberry and blueberry.  Dry, medium minus acidity, medium body, 13.0% ABV.  Organically farmed in the Douro.  Fermentation with naturally occurring yeast makes this close to a “natural” wine.  Whole cluster fermentation picks up tannins from stems, seeds, and skins.  Great value for an aged, balanced red wine.  "
388,1368329,"Strongly aromatic with notes of oak and cherry, this dry, deep purple wine had forward blackberry and moderate earthy notes that lightly dance on the tongue. "
389,1368329,Fruit fun from Douro
390,1368329,"Good red wine, with full flavor and aroma. One of the better red wine in my trip."
391,1368329,Reasonable wine served as ‘house’ in a small restaurant in Lisbon. Like many it improves as you drink the bottle.  Dark coloration and lots of cherry in the taste. Reasonable tannins and not too strong aftertaste. 
392,94433,"Enjoyable red wine from Setubal. Some purple berries and white pepper with a medium, smooth flavour. "
393,94433,"Cherry red wine. Medium intense nose with red cherry, white pepper, earth. Balanced fresh acidity, medium high soft tannins, medium body, spicy and fruity, short finale."
394,94433,It is not worth the 10 bucks. It lacks smell and body. Bit of a dissapointment.
395,94433,"The first time I’m tasting this new one from JMdFonseca and I like it.  Black fruits like blackberry and blueberry up to hints of cassis. A floral dash and some green herbs are offering that little extra in the nose. On the palate it’s the remarkable acidity that grabs you...  nice!3,6⭐️"
396,94433,By the wine 
397,94433,"Deep, dark crimson purple colour. Bouquet of dark fruit, oak, and cloves. Juicy palate of dark cherry with pronounced acidity. Medium bodied with light tannins. Short, dry and fruity finish. Medium price and good value."
398,94433,"Dark ruby colour, scents of fruit,some brandy/alcohol. Getting  dark fruits taste, smooth, light, some tannins later on. A nice light blend."
399,94433,Strong and a bit different. 
400,94433,"Couro, chocolate, fumo, frutas degustado na By the Wine "
401,94433,"Meaty nose with black cherry, prune and wood followed by a palate with pepper, leather, very present tannines and good acidity."
402,94433,"Heavy, will age well, very good for red meats"
403,94433,"Black currant, strawberry, violet and pepper. Excellent food wine. No oak whatsoever. "
404,94433,"Dark berries, smooth on the palate. A good wine for the price "
405,94433,Still young and sharp. One year in the bottle and it will be just fine
406,94433,"Tastes younger than it is, supple, pruny (if that's a word - remember the band Sloan?) and all on cherry, cherry liqueur, prunes of course and good wood. As all things Portuguese, high quality for a correct, even low price. "
407,94430,"Sweet white that needs to be very cold to be enjoyable. Is so sweet that for a dessert wine is good, while served in a small portion, works very well. Either my wife was used to enjoy sweet wines found this one to sweet to have as part of a dinner. "
408,94430,"Tropical fruit, low alcohol and light body. Balanced and short finish. A good sweet wine"
409,94430,"Good price, but very fruity and too fruity, too young and too much of fruit fragrances. Nice for drinks or dessert wine on a hot night with a cube of ice"
410,94430,Sweet light . Ok as light desert wine or free drinking on a warm summer evening. Otherwise pretty basic. 
411,94430,"between sweet wines, this is one of i liked others, like “bd” by tiago cabaço i did not like! "
412,94430,"I never saw a dessert wine made of alvarinho grapes as these portuguese one that has loureiro grapes as well.. Limpid golden color. Nose of pineapple, passion fruit followed by banana and kiwi ending in floral notes. In mouth, fresh, balanced, good acidity with fruity flavors and subtile sweetness. Average lasting with very pleasant sweet fruity aftertaste. Paired perfectly with portuguese egg based desserts. Great! Cheers!"
413,94430,"A rare sweet white from Setubal, in fact pretty rare to find sweet whites in Portugal in general. Terrific balance, so good that it can be drunk on its own. And should be. My wife's favourite Portuguese wine so far."
414,94430,"Crisp white, goes great with seafood "
415,94430,"Quite dry, flowers and rose blossoms on the taste. Not a desert wine though, classic rose"
416,94430,"Good dry wine, lots of fruits- not a dessert wine !"
417,94430,"The wife loved this, she has a disposition for sweat wines and this was a pleasant drink that wasn’t too sweet or tip into the desert wine area"
418,94430,"Wine made with the grape varieties Moscatel de Setúbal (50%) and Malvasia Fina (50%).  Yellow color with greenish tones. Intense sweet aroma,with lmond notes.  In the mouth is very fruity, smooth and sweet.  Prolonged aftertaste."
419,94430,"A moderate nose with floral notes, the body is extremely sweet ( maybe I should have payed more attention to the sweet part written on the bottle 😂😂)  with caramel, pineapple and cinnamon, low acidity. "
420,94430,Quite sweet; really good very cold with ice
421,94430,"Sweet, vanilla wine."
422,5217519,"Very warm, soft and dry. Excellent house wine priced at €3,90. Ruby colour and balanced light red fruits. I give it a 3.75. Saúde!"
423,5217519, cherry dried strawberry
424,5217519,Very smooth. Berry flavours. Good vine at a ok price 
425,5217519,Really good wine. Mix of Berry and vanilla but lovely and soft 
426,5217519,Rich with deep fruit notes and a clean aftertaste
427,5217519,Fruity and great value.
428,5217519,"Fruity, sweet, cherry"
429,5217519,Perfect wine! Ill repeat it asap 
430,35234,Nice chardonnay. Softly taste and aroma of citrus 
431,35234,"Light fruit, pear"
432,35234,"Aromas intensos tropicais , especiarias e citrino ! Final médio encorpado !"
433,35234,"My first Portugaise Chardonnay. Pear, citrus, apricot, grass, vanilla. Quite flat but drinkable. Good pairing with seafood salad. "
434,35234,"Tried first as an aperitif, very flat. Later paired with a prosciutto pizza with gorgonzola, a lot better. Floral crisp nose. Mid body and complexity. Lime. Very fresh. Mid acidity. 3,5 with the right pairing. "
435,35234,"For the price it was fabulous, really citrusy and refreshing a great surprise. "
436,35234,It is better to drink in Portugal natural grapes. Thus chardonnay is ok. Citrus and a little oak.
437,35234,Light yellow. Flowers in nose. White fruit in mouth. Balanced. 
438,35234,Good wine. Too expensive again
439,35234,"Refreshing, crisp, light  but complex"
440,35234,Smooth and rich. A lovely Chardonnay!
441,35234,"Fruity, mild and good for pasta "
442,35234,nevertheless I love chardonnay it was a simple one.
443,35234,"Light, acidy and fruity but complex and good Chardonay taste. "
444,35234,Fragrant slightly sweet  
445,4970384,"#portugesewinenight  The colour is not speaking to me. Pineapple, tropical. Its a little fruity for me and not really my style. Next please. Lets move to the rose....  #winemafiabudapest score 33"
446,4970384,"ES89. Blend of Arinto, Vital & Viosinho white grapes from Lisbon region. 13% alcohol. 5m in French oak. Impressive golden color. Lemon zest. Interesting white wine from Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹."
447,4970384,"Dry, fruity and finishes ever so slightly with oaky notes. "
448,4970384,"Super! Mar d’ fora,  carvoeiro Very very nice with fish!👍🏻"
449,4970384,"Absolutely undrinkable. Dark urine coloured, indistinguishable, strange aftertaste. Just no. "
450,4970384,"Honey coloured, rounded"
451,4970384,"Golden clarity. Started with a chilled wine - straight lemon. However, as it warmed (to near room temperature) it became more aromatic & fruity though still dominated by lemon. A very fresh wine for a blazing hot day - but, at the price, I would go for a vinho verde."
452,4970384,"Golden in color, with a yellow plum flavor, a bit of citrus and light oak. A lovely Portuguese white."
453,4970384,TN to follow.
454,4970384,"Nice, fruity but with good acidity, "
455,4970384,"Minerals, and a sour Apple taste. Very nice."
456,4970384,Lemon then melon. Would work with white fish. A very interesting wine which created a a good debate about flavours and mouthfeel. Final conclusion will not buy again. 
457,4970384,Not my bag. Oxidised melon. 
458,4970384,A bit disappointing
459,4970384,"Very lemon zest and tart, but not acidic. Stony / mineral too. Very dry - maybe too austere, could do with something to soften the astringent sucking on a lemon vibes.  Still, went back for another glass. "
460,81371,"This rich and hearty ruby porto will wisk you away to a beautiful place.  The deep dark crimson near blackish color is hypnotic forcing you to raise your glass in a slow motion that you are not aware.  Before your mouth experiences the pleasure, the bouquet can't help but to give your olfactory senses a message. The porto then flows smooth and softly across your toungue revealing rich ripe dark fruits, chocolate, coffee and the best of figs.  This tawny guy has found a ruby to love."
461,81371,"Raisin, black currant, smooth finish, great value LBV."
462,81371,"Heavy body, riped black fruit, need time for ageing, still young"
463,81371,"Excellente port wine, very tasty. Ideal for an after dinner rejoy"
464,81371,"Very smooth and drinkable, serve slightly chilled."
465,81371,rich deep and warming
466,81371,"Nice port, easy drinking. "
467,81371,The smell is sweet as honny and the taste so good that I need to purchase a whole box soon. You must try this port if you like LBV just a bit.
468,81371,A few days in the fridge....it's still good Complex for a LBV. Lots of sediment as this is the end of the bottle. Good sweetness. Not too hot.
469,81371,A proper port perfect for a long evening. Needs warming and a good decanter but has extraordinary smoothness colour and a real lingering depth.
470,81371,"Deep, opaque purple in the glass, great legs but not overly syrupy. Bundles of baked plum, liquorice, mint and Christmas fruit on the nose but surprisingly light and clean in the mouth. "
471,81371,"I KNOW it is very early to drink this port now but I had to try one bottle! Producers tasting notes is overall ok but astonished me the most is the clear aftertaste og (almost salty) licorice. Really, really made this bottle worthy opening at such young age."
472,81371,Very intense dried fruits and good acidity
473,81371,"Cherries, bkackberries, lemon, tanins, chocolade, dried fruit, beautifull"
474,81371,"Fruity , cherry"

477,1400670,"elegant Dão wine , I tried it with cheese from Portugal , pehaps pairing was not phenomenal but one should try it without strong appetizers and it will shine "
478,1400670,Dark purple-burgundy red. Full fruity forward nose with dark berries and some spice. A full pleasant palate with long finish. Very good wine.
479,1400670,"Deep ruby color . Intense red fruits aroma with spicy notes. In the mouth is smooth, tasty and shows harmony with the barrel. Soft tannins and long and persistent aftertaste. Very good wine."
480,1400670,"My first impression was that of a Sauvignon Blanc,  but then the aromas of the Malvasia Fina came through,  and took over the impression os greenish grass and vegetables, suddenly there were flowers and ripe fruits all over the glass.  Well the mouth with mineral and structured,  green lime zest,  and a salty and smoked ending...I wonder what will be the 2014,  will there be some consistency,  if yes it's a serious contender to  a starting place and ending place in the my top ten..."
481,1400670,"Fruity and round, borderline demi-sec. A safe suggestion by Arsênio, waiter at Maputo's Montebelo Hotel."
482,1400670,Fruity and tasty.
483,1400670,Perfect for arroz de cabidela
484,1400670,Very fruity although with some years. A very good wine.

502,1675533,Full bodied spicy red it combines a ripe rounded easy to drink with rich plum and cherry fruit suited to sliced beef cheese we also had basil  pesto and crackers
503,1675533,"Fresh, medium sweet, nice. Perfect with blue cheese and maple sirup."
504,1675533,"Beiras worked pretty good! Didn't know a wine from the region - kinda stuck too much Douro and Alentejano. Purple brownish deep as a Roriz Tinta should be, odors of nice oak and mineral. You can see the pieces of grape in this cherry fruit filled and top mouth aftertaste of fruits junping - almost citric. A little acid at finish but works very well for a Roriz. Curious experience."
505,1675533,Good drink. NOW
506,1675533,"Smooth full body, fairly nice wine for the price! Not sure where all the criticisms were coming from but deserves at least a 3"
507,1675533,Red fruit easy drinking with a hint of leather 
508,1675533,"Encorpado, acidez na medida certa   "
509,1675533,"Dry, short, smooth"
510,1675533,Friday Mode... So gooood
511,1675533,Not very balanced. Nothing interesting and kind of flat. No depth. Leans heavy on tannins.
512,1675533,Full bodied wine with spice notes dark plum and earthy 
513,1675533,thats a comum wine! in the start there are a baunilha flavour and  the end there are nothing! no flavour no taste!

515,1675533,Good by empório Santa Luzia SP
516,1675533,Very nice wine from me and 3 friends...
517,80259,"Adega do Borba from Alentejo delivers this Monte Claro white that was a great nice surprise.  Made with Arinto, Antao Vaz and Roupeiro it is a very fesh light full of white fruits and flowers.  For the price range of USD$ 7 I find no similars in neighborhood like Argentina Brasil or Chile.  Therefore I consider it a monster value!!"
518,80259,Light and smooth enough. Certainly floral and balanced in mouth. But where it lacks in offense it also lacks in character. Consider it but a table wine. 
519,80259,"Clear medium intensity lemon color with aromas of pineapple , mango ,citrus. On the palate is dry medium plus acidity medium alcohol and medium body. Flavors intensity are also medium with notes of citrus , apple, mango , cream. Finish is also medium "
520,80259,"Tropical fruits, some acidity, long finish. "
521,80259,"Smooth and very crisp. Noticeable acidity, and citrus.  Great structure. "
522,80259,New vintage good balance from Borba. Again we had it with seafood. Excellent value. 
523,80259,Dry white wine.   Fruity and some creamy texture.  Well balanced. Excellent pairing with grilled octopus.  
524,80259,"very good wine, accented tanines and vanilla aftertaste"
525,80259,Elegant white wine with hints of tropical fruits and vanilla. Do not serve to cold!
526,80259,"Pineapple, Peach. Nice fullbodied lunchwine."
527,80259,"Nice full white with lots of secondary flavors, barrique, vanilla."
528,80259,"So silky smooth, I smell some pineapple and a tiny bit of peach it's like I'm drinking water, dry and fresh. I'm having it with some fish which should work wonders"
529,80259,"Still such a great white with lots of vanilla, cream, citrus, pineapple"
530,80259,"From one tasting cup, pleasent fruit aromas in the nose, good and fresh with some complexity and a good tasting finish. Excellent value for this white wine. Great surprise"
531,80259,No comments. .. just hmm #winesofalentejo
532,1733149,Still not harmonic but with great potential if it ever happens that the acid and the oak get together. 
533,1733149,"Smoke and butter on the nose with the slightest hint of baking spices. Similar tasting notes, quite savory. Good with food. "
534,1733149,"Matured white. Amber colour, oak influence, acid still high, yellow fruits."
535,1733149,really good for the price - Chardonay’ish - nutty
536,1733149,"Peachy nose, petrol and green apple on palate, med acidity."
537,1733149," 4.0 oaked and creamy but still vivid.   Complex aromas of citrusy, minerals, florals, creamy, and oaky on the nose.   Moderate body and acidity, creamy texture and balanced yet mild structure (for a oaked white) with a aftertaste of oaky note.  Most surprisingly, the Douro is 14% alcohol content but barely sense it both on the nose and palate.  "
538,1733149,Boo hoo our last bottle of this. Paired with roast chicken with oranges and green olives.  Fabulous wine - can’t seem to find it online to buy again though 😢
539,1733149,"Lovely blend of 3 local grapes i am unfamiliar with  Medium lemon colour, nice full aromas of stone fruits, vanilla, toast & a little nuttiness  Full bodied, particularly for a Portuguese White - nice acidity, pleasant subtle use of oak & a good finish - best White I’ve had on the trip so far"
540,1733149,Dis not like
541,1733149,good drinkable and solid texture 
542,1733149," oak and  butter, very nice bouquet "
543,1733149,"Oak, earth and mushroom to start, then the bright acidity and minerality hit. Grassy on the finish. "
544,1733149,"Very solid wine. Smooth and deep with a lot of texture. Creamy, fatty taste and a rich body."
545,1733149,"Nice white wine, but slight bitter notes..."
546,1733149,"Straw yellow color. Complex and deep bouquet of oak, butter, flowers and hint of honey. Medium to light bodied, balanced citric acids with a floral middle. Finishing with minerals, tarragon, fennel, dill and a grapefruit bitterness in the end. Well balanced and interesting wine. Deserve some good seafood and can handle a bit of fat. Pushing 4s. 5- World class 4 - Very good 3 - Good 2 - OK, but would not buy 1 - To be a avoided"
547,6507821,"Tired blend, deep ruby color, dark fruits, grass, coffee flavors, medium bodied, soft tannins, medium finish.  Alicante Bouschet, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Touriga Nacional. Aged in French oak barrels. 14% abv.  Rate 3.5  "
548,6507821,Very tannic with oak notes. Need to decant before drinking.
549,5175681,"Lots of ripe tropical fruits, some vanilla and oak."
550,5175681,Very tasty. Mix of grapes from different old vines from types unknown to the owner -researching-. Tastes like white Bourgogne!!!
551,5175681,"Unusually good Alentejo, full history on the wine etiquette, 5047 bottles, straight granites and pencil shavings from the two brothers Jorge & Vasco"
552,5175681,"Smooth finish, long lasting. Melon, tropical fruits, light berries."
553,5175681,"4,0  Very elegant and simply delicious!"
554,5175681,"Very nice and balanced white wine, senses of pineapple and tropical fruits, long persistence and great with fish, cheeses and light meals"
555,5175681,Vinhas velhas white ! Excellent surprise ! Full body 
556,5175681,"Pineapple, oak, and a bit of whisky. Smooth start and buttery finish."
557,1166949,"Strawberry and hint of rose petal on the nose, fresh citrus and light apple on the background, dry, soft and beautiful for sunny lazy unhurried afternoon "
558,1166949,This is the 2020 vintage and a magnum. Light in colour and clean. Dry but without a hint of rasp.  Sunday lunch in Meco with good friends. Can’t get much better. 
559,1166949,90/100. A calm and delicate rosé akin to the Provençal classics. Beautifully pale in colour. Notes of strawberry on the palate. Fresh and crisp. No bite. Incredible value for money 
560,1166949,Loved this wine for quality vs price. Excellent tannins and soft smell of roses 
561,1166949,Lovely soft rose. A hint of orange.  Will look out for again.

575,4642954,"I honestly can’t remember all the events that occurred after drinking this wine, but it had been a long day and the six shots of tequila in advance probably didn’t help.  Note for future reference, don’t line the rim of the wine glass with salt, and leave the limes and lemons to one side."
576,4642954,"An Alentejano,made with some typical Portuguese grape varieties. (Unbelievable how many different vinepearls they have in their treasure house) This is an easy going wine with a nice feed  and an overall softness. Some berries and herbs and a little toasted touch. Good! 3,3⭐️"

608,1935409,"This is tasty. Super dark purple and a bit cloudy, just a bit. Dark fruit nose and alcohol in that. Something else like cotton candy in the nose. The flavor is dry, dark, Marionberry. So dry it's almost gritty. Medium to full body. Mild minerals that complement. Acidity is moderate and blends in the profile nicely. Mouth watering and long lasting flavor. Tangy flavor and I attribute some of that to the tannin content. This is a very even, rounded wine that'll please fans of Portuguese wines, newcomers too."

The bubbly sensation is much stronger than the appearance in the glas suggests, which adds to the refreshing experience. "

742,1575487,Light golden. Honey hue  and slightly buttery. Lack of layers of complexity at finish. 
743,1575487,"Complex.mineral. Little bitter, as it is typical for arinto."

755,1105371,Dry rose good partner for a cheesy pasta and some shell fish. Doesn’t hang around long.

758,1105371,"Dry, decent cost ratio."
759,1105371,"Tasting wines from Alentejo, September 20. Beautiful bright pink color, intense red fruits on palate, good acidity, persistent. Defesas were larges demarcated estates that were defended against grazing cattle from other areas and directly linked to the founding of Portugal during the Christian recon quest of the south.

764,1218354,"Spicy. Fruity. Melon, tropical fruit. Quite light. "
765,1218354,Cleaning my backlog. I have tasted older vintages of this one. This edition is vert similar. A very average everyday wine. Had it as an aperitif - no triggering tastes.

775,2384142,"Simple, standard Portuguese white! Fruity. High acidity. Strong mineral feeling. No oak feeling. Hint of lime or green apple. Medium or light body. Unfortunately short but not so bad finish. Easy to drink. It's only table wine but total balance was not so bad. Its first attack was rather sharp with a little floral aroma, and then total balance was short but not so bad finish. Enjoyable as daily white. Good pairing with bread and fried chicken."
776,2384142,"Light-mild body, sharp, floral, nice acid, dry "
777,2384142,Simple white with fresh green apples and fruity apricot.

786,2384142,"Tastes like apple, juicy in flavor (you don't feel too much alcohol) and a little bit too sweet."
787,8971,My favourite brand... the best I ever had 
788,8971,"Wines from Portugal, June 7 - wine fair - only rating. Now let's go to Porto!  Rate 3.8"
789,8971,Good dryness for a port - easy to drink - nice rounded flavours - fruity and complex
790,8971,Very nice port - nice fruity notes with good spice and oak age - very good balance in age 
791,8971,"No wonders, my vintage so a good one - a wine with great freshness, nice and opulent oak touch, intense acidity delicious toffee caramel hints"
792,8971,"Caramel, toasted honey, white chocolate, almond, walnut, pistacho, toffee, pungent on the nose. Well balanced alcohol upholding the natural sweetness of the wine. This is balanced with a coffee bitterness of the long and juicy finish. "
793,8971,"93/100 Wonderful Tawny Port. Notes of honey, toffee, coffee, dried apricot, and almonds. Full and silky in bodied with high acidity and a long creamy finish. Great value for money as far as Ports go."
794,8971,"Excellent - blackcurrant, chocolate and leather - not too sweet"
795,8971,"Gorgeous Colheita port from Niepoort, one of Portugal's most impressive producers. Pale, bright and tawny, with the green rim of long barrel ageing. Nose of dried fruit, old wood and spice. The palate starts soft and sweet, with a tangy, spicy finish. Decadent, bold and complex. Raisin, date, dried cherry, citrus peel, cinnamon and nutmeg, walnut and brown sugar. The big flavours carry the alcohol well and it has a lovely combination of intensity and balance. Very moreish, too good for a Wednesday evening!"
796,8971,"Trivia: does anyone knows the difference between tawny, ruby, colheita, garrafeira, vintage, crusted, single quinta, lbv? And your favorite?  Great dinner in Alabaster restaurant in Madrid, from Galicia, finished with a colheita Porto.  Brownish tawny color, mid intensity. Nose is very nutty with aromas of dry fruit like figs.Sweet and mineral attack, fullbody sensantion,pleasant and frank palate that stays for long time. Great dinner and great Porto:)"
797,8971,"(1980 Colheita)  Upfront forward nose. Elegant smell of raisin, figs and nuts. Velvet Soft mouthfeel. Sweet Vanilla flavours and apricot/fig/date  and a mouthwatering sensation. Astonishing lively at the age of 35 years. Lovely balanced. (was lucky to find at a restaurant serving it at 5 EUR by the glass.) Mega bargin.... Great Long after taste."
798,8971,"In my opinion Niepoort makes some of the best ports, that maintain to be incredibly fruit forward, even at astonishing old ages.  This is just another great example of this. Tasted up against 1968, and it was hard to say which one was better. This had a more vinous feel to it, with notes of blackberry crumble, cigar box, chewy dark chocolate, salt caramel, cassis, black cherries and fruitcake. Needles to say both were fantastic. "
799,8971,"20.5%. Opened on New Years. Very nice. Enjoyed over the past few evenings with a variety of holiday goodies. Paired well with mince pie, fruitcake, goat cheese (a surprise) Dubliner Cheese, and peppermint gum drops. Cheers."
800,8971,"Incredible port! Well balanced with hints of caramel, toffee and almonds. Definitely recommend trying this one."
801,8971,An amber ambrosia from the Niepoort master craftsmen. Lots of lovely dried fruit and caramel but not overly sweet. Beautifully balanced. 
802,2072913,Top acidity. Very special and very much its own style. 95 point

805,1200390,candied caramel and bourbon pecans and plums. complex smooth and warm thickness.
806,1200390,A young port in taste. More ruby than tawny. Sweet sorghum and ripe macerated strawberry and red raspberry.
807,1200390,Medium ruby. Delicate aroma with some menthol and oak. Very concentrated berry flavor and a mild finish. Rich and elegant with low tannins. Enjoyable wine
808,1200390,Great taste that's not too overwhelming for dessert wine. Mint aftertaste.
809,1200390,Pairing: Morgado do Buçaco
810,1200390,"The best LBV i have tasted.  Its not just raisin and cherry, great depth with balsamic notes and a soft touch. Great balance with some nice acidity. "
811,1200390,"Nice, but little sharp."
812,1200390,"Both earthy and fruity.  Velvety, soft tannins.  Forest berries, vanilla,  well integrated. "
813,1200390,"Young fresh LBV. Summer berries, some chocolate."
814,1200390,Unfortunately summer backlog;)
815,1200390,"Plum, walnut and mocha notes. Good structure and mouthfeel."
816,1200390,"Dark red color with visible wine tears. Chocolate, oak, dark fruit on the nose. Tastes of chocolate, cherry and raspberry  "
817,1200390,"Excellent LBV. I prefer Tawny but this LBV is great!very sweet and great cherry color. Coffee chocolate and oak, plum and blackberry. Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz  Excelente LBV. Prefiro tawny and este LBV e muito bom, cono todos os Quinta Nova. Cor de cereja, com botas de cafe, chocolate, ameixa mirtilho e carvalho. Blend de Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca e Tinta Roriz."
818,1200390,"Second tasting...very consistent. Blackberry and dark chocolate on the nose; deep black cherry and coffee grounds in the midrange; fresh juniper, ripe raspberries and honeyed oak on the finish. Quite good. "
819,1201097,"A worthwhile purchase for a rare opportunity of tasting an unusual Portuguese indigenous grape.  NZ SB-esque nose - grassy, citrussy etc.  But an altogether different taste to your usual Marlboroughs sauv blancs. Initial touch of sweetness, but quickly developing into ripened red apples and finishing on sour pear drops.  Interesting wine - enjoyed it a lot."
820,1201097,"Fruity, with green notes. Not as sweet as most vinho verde. Not fizzy as one might expect from vinho verde. On the more elegant and sophisticated side. Revista de Vinhos 16p Good value for money at 6,5€"
821,1201097,Refreshing and a good summerwine 
822,1201097,"Aromatic nose with white flowers, gooseberry, grass and pear. Lightly Off dry wine with good acidity. Refreshing mouthfeel with green apple, lime juice and zest."

826,1201097,"A good, affordable and drinkable white "
827,1201097,"Reminds me of a Chardonnay, oak, smoke apple.. was hoping for something more crisp and mineral-y  "
828,1201097,"Fruit bomb of a nose- tropical and peachy.  The palate killed it, way too sharp and acidic and quite full in the mouth.  Oddly, the finish wasn't too heavy but it lacked interest in any case.  Completely unbalanced and one that I would pass on next time.  Drinkable but not likeable"
829,1201097,"High acidity and a citrus taste, it smells very floral of linden and acacia at first and then it bursts of peach in the smell and taste. Very nice"
830,1201097,"Nice wine to start out next day in Portugal. Fresh, dry, crisp and mineral. A light taste of lemon grass and grapefruit. Really enjoyable and well balanced"
831,1201097,This is a much more serious and layered expression of this grape. More floral and tropical on top of typical citrus and high acidity. Reminds a bit of Albariño. 
832,1201097,"Pale lemon colour. Very aromatic wine with the aromas of lime, lime zest, blossom and orange. Light bodied with the high acidity. Fresh easy going wine, pleasant to drink."
833,1201097,"A straw color with greenish hues leads to a nose filled with hints of citrus, orange blossom and flint. It's fresh with a med-body, graceful acidity, fresh minerals and a persistent finish."
834,1368603,Now that is something quite different! Very complex with layers upon layers of spices and fruits dancing in the mouth. Long aftertaste. Loved it.
835,1368603,"Tastes like a port wine. Smells like a port wine. Yep, definitely a port wine. Probably a really good one too - just not able to appreciate it🥴"

Easy accessible"
837,1368603,"Deep purple in color with seductively long legs. Pronounced nose bursting with black fruits, slight menthol, and faint pine like nose.   Flavors of cassis, evergreen, blackberry jam, and sweet baking spice flooded the palate."
838,1368603,"The color of this wine is an intense brilliant ruby red. Aromas of blackberry and black plum are followed by spice notes. The wine is a smooth on the palate with lively tannins and nuances of ripe fruit, plum and cherry. The finish is fresh, savory and long."
839,1368603,"Really excellent structure, tannins have a grippy, furry, quality that give the body a great heft. Fleshy black cherry and wonderful ripe fruit with some curious floral/herbal aromas of jasmine, lavender, and fennel. Very concentrated, powerful port. "
840,1368603,"Nice fruity, comfortebel acicity. Strong and deep red fruity taste. Long and strong feel in the mouth. A sligt hint of tobaco."
841,1368603,"2015 bottled 2019. Sweet, rich, acid, earthier than the 2005 vintage. Somehow sweetness is not the main flavor component. Fruity but still earthy."
842,1368603,"Nice one. Atoma is not too intensive. Pepper, balsamic notes, not as tart as my prev Porto wine (Collector).  "
843,1368603,Rich smooth and strong.

On the nose a note of tropical fruits including ripe syrupy pineapple, passionfruit possibly and some mangoes. On the a palate a prominent lime/mineral note along with some sour pineapple and a medium-floral finish. Nice balance in acidity (ie not overboard) also. I'd get it again without hesitation.  "

904,2601224,Nice nose. Dark fruit and red fruit. A bit short.
905,2601224,This is better after breathing for at least 30 minutes and being slightly chilled. The plum and blackcurrant tastes come together fondly

907,2601224,"Crisp enough but still relatively young, imagine it will become a little more complex over time but reasonably drinkable now (white)"
908,2601224,"Got this as a wedding gift, to open on our fifth anniversary. Two days tardy, we had this with beef stew. Rich nose of cherry and vanilla upon opening, which quickly started to give subtle, bell pepper vegetal aromas, typical of older sangiovese (though I know this is Tinto).  On the palate, rich with a good dose of acidity, more pepper notes, with a backbone of bright cherry. Very pleasant wine, if maybe a couple of years past peak."
909,2601224,Decent enough but a bit dry & earthy for my taste.
910,2601224,An intense ruby colour with notes of fig and prune which give way to vanilla and coffe from the 2 year oak barrell ageing.

912,1843934,"The name of this wine means ""few clothing"" or ""scantily dressed"" ... at 14% there is a strong blast off the wine at first sup. Strong Oak nose notes. Hints of cherry on the palate and overtones of wood which lingers in the mouth afterwards. Not a bad wine and an easy drink. "
913,1843934,Cherry taste fruity sweet lovely wine
914,1843934,"It has the flavours of typical Alentejo wine with some black fruits but also red fruits, but they are very flat and doesn't develop... Not enough body, not enough structure. Considering the price - it is fair"

929,1843934,"My last one from the trip to Portugal, on the TAP flight home ✈️. Complementary snacks and drinks are getting very rare on short haul flights so I really appreciate this one. Funny name too, too shy to say what it means 😉☺️. There’s some Alfrocheiro in this blend and I swear I can find it back in the herbal nose with clove, black cherry and rhubarb. In the palate very red fruit driven, especially red cherry but also black cherry, very tart acidity and OK tannines. 3.3"

937,1843934,Portugal degustation #4. Fresh red fruits and mild tannins. Really reminiscent of easy-going pinot noir or gamay. Well received at lunch with pasta al pomodoro with burrata.

953,1221513,Has the bitterness of citrus fruits like lemon and lime. Probably more for the summer than a stormy December evening by the fire. Grand wine 
954,1221513,"Our corporate summer party was catered with this one. I wouldn’t have reviewed except I wanted all of you to see that amazing price tag.  Quaffable enough actually ! Nutty, stone fruit. Would take this in a second over a lot of new world industrial swill. "

1003,3169315,"Straw yellow color. Rich, potent aroma of honey, yeast and ripe stone fruits. Very nice and inviting. On the palate are rather unpleasant bitter herbs and spices, like cloves coated in lemon juice. The palate and the nose are so mismatched I blurted ""Yuck"" before I could control myself. Weird. It's also quite oaky. Hmm. And all this at $21.59? Meh..  *** I tried it during wine tasting at the local liquor store"
1004,3169315,Very esoteric oaky leather tannins with a distinct clove oregano spice lingering taste on palate. Not the greatest Portuguese white wine but very interesting. Would go well in a wine pairing at a ski resort ;)

This wine is another that I love. dark fruit tobacco Leather pepper cherry, very ripe one .... Ohhhhh if you have a chance, try it..... Cheers 😘 😘😘😘😘"
1027,1451411,"I selected this wine and I am proud of my choice 😀. Tobacco and plum - at first, then some black fruits,  oak, and light chocolate.  Good full body wine ...however I prefer my Touriga 🤓"
1028,1451411,"3.95  We missed our Ermelinda !! Enjoyed after the first Monday back at work post holiday. On the nose, black fruit and dried fruit, with vanilla notes. On the palate, more tobacco and chocolate with fruity notes. "
1029,1451411,"Wet wood on the nose,very musky, but nice,very.Palate is syrah mainly.sandy long and enjoyable,  very well made.Congratulations to the winemaker.Unusual blend"

1039,1451411,"Well, after the second bottle i had to give up and raise its rating. The food contributed to appreciate it. The aspect was impressive right at the first glass, with a deep red with tones of violet, no transparency. The acidity was evident, very pleasant and complementing the carrot spaghetti sauteed with a generous portion of milk butter and ""Canastra"" cheese. Also a salad with dried tomatoes and mozzarella sticks. The body was great, surely a gift from the Syrah, well ripened and with high levels of sugar"
1040,1451411,It becomes increasingly better to drink (and not just because I'm more drunk). 
1041,3784027,"Beautiful tears, granada colour. Smells of prunes and some dried berries. The palate is very rich, lots of ripe fruits, some wood on it to lend it additional smoothness. Finish of ripe cherries and a bit of pipe tobacco. Awesome value for money."

1047,3784027,"Beautiful floral aroma. Gentle mouthfeel, medium body. Fruity flavor without being sweet. Dry, dusty tannins on the finish. Elegant and fresh, great value."

1062,1921978,"I tasted many wines from Portugal, but I think this is my first Portugeese white. I don't know why, I guess I never had some oportunity before. And that is mistake I will have to fix, because this one was very good. And for excellent price, 7-8 Euros I think. Even though it's made partialy of Albarino, I couldn't find that typical Albarino aromas - aromatic and crispy. This one is more discreet, very clear and tasty, with dominant lime. Very enjoyable."
1063,1921978,"Very well made. Elegant, refined, smooth and fresh. Drinking superbly well now. Doesn't have a lot of density but plays a very elegant trick, slightly citric and perfect Wood usage, never too present. I have some doubt on its aging potential. I have no doubts how good it is!"

1070,1921978,"You can really taste the same grapes that make the port. Lovely berrys, strong tannins. If you like the style this is excellent "
1071,1323947,"Savoury and rustic tannins. Flavours and aromas of dark berries, macerated berries, cloves, spice, meat, black pepper, wood, chocolate, earth. High flavour intensity, medium body, medium finish. "

1101,1245210,Old style with modern quality. Very good
1102,1245210,Excellent. Good value for money
1103,1245210,Medium body with round tannins. Initially somewhat alcoholic but as it breathes berries aromas appear

1111,1245210,"Reminds me of italian Primitivo di Salento, but its a bit softer"
1112,1245210,Some VA on the nose but still nice to drink now. Cheers
1113,8971,"This was a gift from my aunt in Lisbon. She held onto it many years and I'm so grateful I got to have this. Absolutely delicious! It was a golden orange and beautifully balanced. It tasted of caramelised fruits and, with a cheese platter, I was in heaven. Obrigado Tia Anabela!!"
1114,8971,"Great length, good intensity, great complexity and good balance.   4.2 stars"
1115,8971,Tawny port which is very special.
1116,8971,"Great, absolutely great"

1118,8971,"Caramel, toasted honey, white chocolate, almond, walnut, pistacho, toffee, pungent on the nose. Well balanced alcohol upholding the natural sweetness of the wine. This is balanced with a coffee bitterness of the long and juicy finish. "
1119,8971,"(1980 Colheita)  Upfront forward nose. Elegant smell of raisin, figs and nuts. Velvet Soft mouthfeel. Sweet Vanilla flavours and apricot/fig/date  and a mouthwatering sensation.

1122,8971,"Gorgeous Colheita port from Niepoort, one of Portugal's most impressive producers. Pale, bright and tawny, with the green rim of long barrel ageing. Nose of dried fruit, old wood and spice. The palate starts soft and sweet, with a tangy, spicy finish. Decadent, bold and complex. Raisin, date, dried cherry, citrus peel, cinnamon and nutmeg, walnut and brown sugar. The big flavours carry the alcohol well and it has a lovely combination of intensity and balance. Very moreish, too good for a Wednesday evening!"
1123,8971,"Just as great as the 1962, but this bottle showed more age, and the blackberry jam, tobacco and oaky notes were accompanied by a hefty share of honey/nuts aromas. Balance was sublime and alcohol stood furthest back in line, being overshadowed by the complexity and elegance of this fantastic vintage port. "
1124,8971,"20.5%. Opened on New Years. Very nice. Enjoyed over the past few evenings with a variety of holiday goodies. Paired well with mince pie, fruitcake, goat cheese (a surprise) Dubliner Cheese, and peppermint gum drops. Cheers."

Great dinner in Alabaster restaurant in Madrid, from Galicia, finished with a colheita Porto.  Brownish tawny color, mid intensity. Nose is very nutty with aromas of dry fruit like figs.Sweet and mineral attack, fullbody sensantion,pleasant and frank palate that stays for long time. Great dinner and great Porto:)"

1146,1194130,"It’s so nice to get glass or max 2 of this incredible Porto that flows smoothly via your mouth leaving abundant bouquet of very gentle sweetness that provokes to take in more of it although be careful, you might be loosing coordination and life might become too sweet! "
1147,1194130,"A great port that will most likely keep improving with age, although it tastes great now. Well balanced with notes of dried fruit (cherry and plum)"
1148,1194130,"Inky purple. Clean, highly aromatic with  raisin, black fruit, walnut, orange zest, mincemeat. Sweet, high acidity, medium tannins, full body and long finish. Palate confirms the nose. Decanter FWE. "
1149,1194130,"Red fortified wine for ageing. Because of very dense, velvety tannins, which still a bit dominate in the mouth together with fine sweetnes. cherries, some dried fruits in the nose. After 10 year in bottle shows too little note of maturity. Ready to drink but will improve from ageing further 15-25 years. Gaining complexity and softening texture."
1150,1194130," Incredibly concentrated, raisin, dark fruit, but with a later beam of acidity. Spectacular, but way too young. "
1151,1194130,Nice roundness with hints of plums

1158,1718756,Splendid balance of fruit and spice with low residue of pine. 
1159,1718756,"I like! Good and round. Easy with some fruit and a nice smell. Deep red color, almost black.  Don't like the corkscrew. It insist on drinking it all in one day. "

1161,1718756,"Thick, sweet, sweet dried plums and blackberries. "

1166,1718756," Dry smooth. Raisins, nice level of fruit. "
1167,1718756,I can’t believe what a value!!  Unfiltered goodness!!
1168,1718756,Terrible - just terribel. Will use it for some sauces instead of drinking it
1169,76390,"Still good, drunk July 2016."
1170,76390,"Caramel, dried fruit and fig. Deep ruby color. Balanced. Medium sweet. Long finish"

1173,76390,"Multi grape port wine from older vintage and still at decent price and with rich notes of cherries, chocolate and oak - and with an interesting “cheesy” hint (kind of sweet cheese). Good acidity and nice, nice."
1174,76390,"Still good, red colour. Very subtle nose of decaying berries, pepper and mint. Quite sweet with very good acidity and nice tannic reserve. For a so-so house this is a surprisingly good effort in a difficult year. 92p"
1175,76390,Very nice as a chilled aperitief
1176,76390,"Well balace between fruit and acid. And tanics. Raissin, tobacco and chocolate and hint of caffe. Very well aged in the Bjørklund-cellar."
1177,76390,Nice glas of tasty and balanced Wine bringing back memories of an good old friend 
1178,76390,Typical port but a little less syrupy than I would have expected.  Cork breaking into the bottle didn’t help
1179,76390,"Caramel, raisin, fig, prune, smoke, vanilla."
1180,76390,Again a really very fine vintage port in all senses. 
1181,76390,"Interesting notes of violet, cherry, mushrooms, forest, nuts."
1182,76390,Excelente vinho do Porto!!! Viva Portugal!!
1183,76390,"A good port, dkr. 99,-, fine buy. Need some power, a lot of sugar/sweetness,"
1184,1165500,"Intense and limpid ruby red color . Aromas of blackberry  jelly, caramelized orange peel and dark chocolate with a touch of dried figs and dark raspberries . On the palace ripe dark berry fruits with great aromatic complexity,well structured and pure. This is the perfect partner for blue cheese or dark chocolate desserts."
1185,1165500,Nice fruity and full bodies portwine with a great baance between sweetness and fruityness.
1186,1165500,"[Tecedeiras Port 2/3] Juicy nose with ripe prune and brown raisins followed by a palate with beautiful acidity, fine tannines, heartwarming sweetness and some caramel. 3.9"
1187,1165500,"PORT TOP DOG - March 2015.  Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Tinta Amarela and Tinto Cão - just a few of the deep, dark and delicious Portuguese grape varieties to be found in port. At 20% alcohol, this is a powerhouse, with fortunately enough body, complexity, flavour intensity and acidity to pull it off. Delicious aromas and flavours of cuberdon candy, vanilla, liquorice, black cherry, orange peel, caramel and velvety violets, supported by smooth, ripe tannins. Can be drunk now or for several years to come."
1188,1165500,"3,8⭐️ is there a new wind blowing through Porto land? In the last port wines I tasted, it seems like the sweetness is tamed a bit. A “nouvelle vague”? Anyway: red fruit, sultanas, burnt caramel,... nice viscosity and mouthfeel, a true quality product."
1189,1165500,"Dark fruit and chocolate aromas. Half sweet, full body and medium finish."
1190,1165500,Vet enjoyable. Claridges desert wine pairing #7.

1192,1165500,Deveria ter sido classificado como Vintage.
1193,1165500,Celebrating my son's birth. Best wine I've ever had!!!
1194,1235970,"What a nice rosė, pure 100% PN cuvėe brut with never ending, fine bubbles consistently wiggling pinky surface! Subtle nose of forest strawberry, apricot, croissant, crashed stones. Minerally shaking, super dry palate, balanced acidity. Rejuvenating, fresh, long aftertaste.  This Czar deserves a kingdom on 1/1/2021. Truly recommended. Bold 4."
1195,1235970,"N: strawberries, apricot, brioche  P: small bubbles, dry, medium minerality  T: strawberries, red currants, apricot, brioche F: medium long, consistent "
1196,1235970,Another interesting. A Spumante rose made out of Pinot noir grape. 
1197,1235970,"(4,5) Hugely surprising rosé Sparkling from Portugal. 100% rosé. This easily beats some stellar Champagne. Smell of toast and croissants. Taste has raisins, mushrooms, hay, straw, blackcurrant, amarena, sultanas, green herbs. Delicate mousse. Intense flavours. Nicely dry. Almost like it has dried grapes in its concentrated flavours. Long finish. @Perswijn Select"
1198,1235970,A fine pinot... Nothing to envy to pinot champagne.
1199,1235970,"Top of the line bubbles at Murganheira with 100% PN and 5 years on lees. Earthy nose with red berry and red apple followed by a palate with pronounced, slightly tart acidity, blood grapefruit and more red berry before the bit hard finish. 3.6"
1200,1235970, strawberry red currant minerals apricot
1201,1235970,"The mousse is a bit too aggressive in my opinion. Nice breaddy notes accompanying strawberry aromas. Good, not impressive though. Paired with a friend gras and a pear jelly, excellent match."
1202,1235970,Like the Brut better. But this one is quite good. Ruby color but did not expect the bitterness from skins. Very flowery nose.
1203,1235970,"Great taste, fresh, smooth. Great blend of rose. citrus "
1204,1235970,"I feel like Portuguese sparkling is undiscovered, have had very good bubbles in the north of the country. This one is from 100% Pinot Noir. Very dry, minerally, a bit of red berries.  Dry good. "
1205,1235970,"Good Portuguese sparkling rosé made 100% of Pinot Noir. Nice salmon  color on the glass. Mostly strawberries in the nose. Mouth with nice small bubbles, strawberry (not too much), dry and medium finish. I really enjoyed this wine"
1206,1235970,"3,8. Lacks depth of flavors. Still nice! "
1207,1235970,"Apricot, honey and acidic. Not bad, but I would have wanted the flavors to come out more."
1208,1235970,Good sparkling wine from azores 
1209,1418817,"Cool red, deep ruby, maybe would deserve a bit more aging. Quite charged in alcohol at 15% #wine #portugal #red #tinto #vino #syrah Grande Escolha"
1210,1418817,Fruity and a lot of tannins. Need at least 5 years in the cellar
1211,1418817,"Had a blast with this work of art. Ruby, medium sweet and well balanced. Ripe strawberry notes, plum - like sweetness, full bodied but not much. Uma maravilha de Touriga Nacional."
1212,1418817,70/100 Disappointed 😕
1213,1418817,Very rich and full of taste
1214,1418817,"Don’t know what happened but I expected more from this wine, I will give it another try."
1215,1418817,"Very Good blend of alicante boushet and syrah. Another Great wine from Solar dos Lobos. Strong tanins, notes of tomato and vanilla."
1216,1418817," Although the label says only Alicante Bouschet & Syrah this wine by enology of Mrs. Susana Esteban has certainly Alicante Bouschet, Touriga Nacional and Syrah :-)  Deep purple red color with thin blue-violet rim. Profound and concentrate ripe black fruits aromas with fresh, vanilla and oak. Firms and polish tannins with pleasant acidity, high alcohol level and medium to long finish. Very good wine with aging potential (+/- 4 or 5 years). "
1217,1418817,Very nice. Some sulfur and oak on nose. Excellent balance. Round and long finish.
1218,1418817,"Full body, medium to full tanins, earthy smell , cherry, arugula, pepper, black currant   Very pleasant. Perfect with tapas or red meet   "
1219,1418817,"Near Lissobon the river Tejo flows into lovely wine country - granite & schist - nuce structure albeit with some alcohol burns. Alicante Bruchet, Tourige Nacional & Syrah at least and probably some more varietals in the blend."
1220,1418817,"(Nota: 17/20) 03-09-14: got better in palate, softer, really needs to be decanted but probably has more to grow   02-09-14Dark in color shows a very pleasent and complex nose, fresh red fruits with floral notes, it also reveals toasted wood and smoke, in the mouth is where resides the problem in my opinion but this wine probably should have been decanted and it wasn't, i feel it a bit harsh and with a high acidity. Will be saved with vacue vin and thrown in the fridge. Lets see how it will be tomorrow"
1221,1418817,It’s a great wine.  It is also the 200st wine I rate on Vivino 
1222,1418817,"Classic Douro taste, a tad sweet but excellent body and weight of barrel"
1223,1418817,Don’t remember it but we’re pretty damn happpy
1224,76378,Great Tawny. Vintage is always a vintage!
1225,76378,"🍷Colour: Deep amber 👃🏻Nose: Raisins and brown sugar, dried figs, honey. 👅Mouth: Brown sugar, raisins, dried fruit and a fine acidity. Notes of nuts, chocolate, oak and vanilla i finish."
1226,76378,"4.2 90p. Dark brown with an orange hue. Deep, but slightly distant palate with dried apricots, brown sugar and a hint of cherry sauce and oak. Really nice oxidated palate with nuts in honey and oak. Medium acidity. Sweet, tart lingering finish.  Choose 1966, 1985 or 2006, if you want to optimize QPR.  10+"
1227,76378,Delicious Colheita. Light brown colour. Notes off prom and sweet fruit. Rich taste. Smooth with a long after taste. Really powerful with a harmonic tannin and acidity.
1228,76378,"Nice and above the usual standard suspects. Not quite up there with the big stuff but 4,1 is quite precise 😊"
1229,76378,"A good colheita port exuding nutty and figgy aromas with good length, but lacking the depth of flavour and harmony displayed by colheitas due to the poor conditions of the 2002 vintage."
1230,76378,My first real Porto. I remember) 2014
1231,76378,"Krydret, sherry noter, ikke for sød og nem at tømme 😊"
1232,76378,"NOT sweet, to much taste of alcohol"
1233,76378,"Dark raisins and vanilla notes. sweetness was bright and sunshine like, but the Finnish was too tart. "
1234,76378,"A very Nice Colheita! Deep, rich, Sweet and savoury. Dried fruits, nuts, caramel and Vanilla. Lovely acid. I drink way to little port!"
1235,76378,Drinking port with the angels ! I often think colheita more complex than vintage port. This has been in the barrel for 18 years before bottling
1236,76378,This port makes my heart sing. Forty five years--1963 to 2008 on oak. Magnificent balance. Pairs well with a 60 year old pre embargo cigar.
1237,76378,"Fruity, nutty, toffee, with delightful acidity - a rich, intense and concentrate port wine that never stops to amaze me - a very elegant port "
1238,76378,"Outstanding, I am not experienced enough to really say. However this is by far one of the best experiences I have had with ANY wine. Mind-blowing"
1239,1768258,"A red wine from Algarve Portugal 🇵🇹  Taste of blackberries, earth, oak and cherries  Medium acidity, medium aftertaste and medium in taninnes  It’s a nice full bit stil refreshing red wine  Nice!!!!"
1240,1768258,Dull straight out of the bottle. But once you swirl it and smell it you get the woodiness and oaky coming though on the nose. Then when you taste it has strong vanilla flavors coming through. 
1241,1768258,Giving it a 4 because of the surprise. Perhaps algarvian wines are finally arriving. 
1242,1768258,Really nice bouquet when first opened. Definitely needs to breath before it reaches its full potential. A nice drinking wine.
1243,1768258,A lovely dry yet fruity Algaeve white. Great things happen when local grapes are mixed & matched! 👌🏼
1244,1768258,Decent drinking wine but nothing to wow about. 
1245,1768258,Surpris par cet excellent vin.
1246,1768258,"Red fruit, medium bodied, easy day to day wine. Highly recommend!"

1248,1768258,Full bodied and rich 
1249,1768258,"Interesting, relatively dry red"
1250,1768258,"Dark ruby colour. Plums, dark berries a little bit of toffee. Absolutely massive, also on the palate. Very dense and thick (15% Vol.), already smooth tannins, would like to see this wine in 3-5 years. Definetely Bordeaux-Style wine, very powerfull, but to ne questioned whether it can mature over the years."
1251,1768258,"Nice ruby colour, oaky flavour, a bit young but still quite balanced for its age (bottled look only seven months ago on December 2018). Oaky aftertaste."
1252,1768258,"Very nice, plum on the nose. This is a winner... earthy notes as well. In the mouth smoth and balanced, watch out Rhône the rest of the world is coming for you "
1253,1768258,Well balanced with aromas of  red fruits and blackcurrant and spices.  Full bodied slightly oaky taste with an intense finish. An excellent wine. 
1254,1213732,It is a very good wine! It presented a lot of black plum and spices aromas and a lot of black fruit flavors! It is a medium body and equilibrated wine!
1255,1213732,"Great portuguese red blend with syrah and Castelão. Intense red color. Nose of intense plum and blackberries wrapped in subtile vanilla and oak notes. In mouth, rustic as normally wines made with Castelão grapes are, bit very pleasant to drink. Marked tannins, good body and acidity delivering black fruit flavors, wet soil and oak notes. Good lasting showing a “almost sweet” vanilla aftertaste with the black fruit finish. Rough that satisfice, I would say. Paired perfectly with my four cheeses pizza. Cheers!"
1256,1213732,"Encorpado, final persistente "
1257,1213732,Intense. Balanced. Good persistence. I really liked it!
1258,1213732,"Bold and fruity style. Goes fine with meat. In a BBQ with a couple of friends. 3.6 Estilo encorpado e frutado. Vai bem com carne. Num churrasco com um casal de amigos. 3,6"

1260,1213732,"Mint aroma, red fruits and black pepper taste. Huge tannins and high acidity "
1261,1213732,"Encorpado, taninos presentes com acidez presente."
1262,1213732,"Very alcoholic, left a harsh flavour on the mouth. Too strong for my taste at the beginning but after we let the wine breath, it becomes a very nice and smooth wine, pleasant to the senses."
1263,1213732,"Really strong! Dark violet, heavy wine!"
1264,1213732,Not bad. Day by day wine.
1265,1213732,"Rubi, frutado e encorpado. Excelente custo beneficio."

1270,1174337,"First time with this Portuguese legend. At 13 years of age this is a full fruit super structured and full body red. Tannins well resolved, long finish and overall great wine. "
1271,1174337,"This is a very well produced wine from very old plants. Complex, structured and tasty wine."
1272,1174337,"Fruity, round, good acidity, medium body, long finish. It keeps getting better!!"
1273,1174337,"Never given a wine  a 5 before. Really, really  wonderful wine experience. In magnum and 15 years in the waiting. Mature, fruity, so smooth and concentrated with an incredible freshness. So, so nice."

1277,1174337,Amazing! Perfect with fish and shrimp.
1278,1174337,Shown the complexity and 10+years of aging but still have a long way to age
1279,1174337,"Something wrong with this particular wine(year?). I am a big fan of Mouchao wines, but as Mouchao 2003 (theoretically the same wine) there is something in the aroma that stops me from drinking this one even after hours in a decanter, herbaceous, smoke from green wood!? Not sure but something completely unpleasent"
1280,1174337,Perfect portuguese so many flavours
1281,1174337,Very good wine
1282,1174337,"Basically the traditional Mouchão 2002 with the addition of being kept in the producers cellar until  its fit for optimum consumption. The usual black ripe fruit nose with balsamic,light wood and dark chocolate notes.Full palate of jam and ripe fruit,vanilla and figs,wood and almonds...balsamic. The full body gives way to a very persistent end with good acidity filling the palate.There is a trapped spirit in the bottle that makes you eat and drink more.Be very careful!!!! "
1283,1174337,"Excelente! Potente, elegante, macio, carvalho intenso no final. 🍷🍷"
1284,1260143,"From the region ""Alentejo"" , the largest wine region in the middle of Portugal and covers almost a third of the country. 🍇 Trincadeira, Aragonez, Alicante Bouschet and a       small quantity of Cabernet Sauvignon. 👁 Intense deep red color. 👃The perfect wine in this cold weather.      Dark forest fruit, vanilla, a smoky accent, tobacco       herbs and some liquorice. 👅The same elements on the palate and cedar.      A nice balance between power and elegance, acidity       and sweetness. 🎓 My score: 3,8⭐"
1285,1260143,"Lovely wine, full flavoured and a good level of tannin. Dark and mature fruits with some spice. I may have to finish the whole bottle.."

1298,1260143,"Excellent Portuguese sun in a botlle. It went very well with my steak and chips, but it wiuld hold its own amongst the better gastronomy too."
1299,1149941,I’d love to buy it at that price. A wonderful bespoke wine maker. I look forward to returning to the vineyard in the future. 
1300,1149941,"Good quality stuff from the Douro valley here. Ink colored, at its core practically black juice. Voluminous nose full of mature dark cherries and milk chocolate. On the palate at first a bit aggressive but with some air to breath it smoothens out to more elegance and finer tannins. Couple more years in the cellar won't hurt though."
1301,1149941,Very good Douro
1302,1149941,"Red blend with fruit and earth nose; moderate tannins with red fruits in dry, balanced wine.  An inexpensive red to enjoy!"

1309,1149941,"We spent couple days in their domaine last summer.. Their rooms were amazing, service incredible, in the middle of their wine yards.. They have Porto, couple reds and a rose. Educated in south France, their winemaker gives a French touch that distinguish for other douro's. Nothing special, but curious anyway."
1310,1149941,"Powerfull with notes of dark ripe fruites. Medium+ acidity, low on tannins."
1311,1149941,"Dark berries, spice, quite acidic with firm tannins."
1312,1149941,Great white wine from Douro. Portugal
1313,1149941,"Red Douro from Portugal 🍷🇵🇹  Dark bold red colour with violet shining. On the nose dark berry and much oak. On the palate a strong body - harsh tannins, dry, bold fruit in the background. Unbalanced... maybe too young for drinking... even day 2 don‘t open it."
1314,75666,"Cab from Lisboa region. Textbook Cab on the nose, medium body on the palate. Nice fruit, good length. "
1315,75666,"Rounded, balanced, rich of blackcurrants matching a light meal. Had slightly higher expectations"

1324,75666,"Blue berries, liquorice,"
1325,75666,89p Fresh and lean. Interesting. Not your typical cab. Herbs and red and black currant. No new oak to me. A modern old world style.

1328,75666,"Young, fresh and juicy. Light for a cab but with dark fruit and tannins to match.   blackcurrant blackberry chocolate blueberry raspberry tobacco licorice cedar oak pepper"
1329,1906277,"Martel Tour des Vins 2021 (No. 3)  The Cortes des Cima winery is always a good choice for friends of Alentejano. The single varietal Aragonez is particularly well done. Black berries, cherries and plums, 9 months barrel aging. Very good value for money."
1330,1906277,"really fresh black fruits and berries; med light body, but still great character"
1331,1906277,"I must admit I like tempranillo (which is called here aragonez), cortes de cima and alentejo wines so... of course I liked it? (It's not always the case but it happened here.  I'm not kidding, this is probably the favorite expression of tempranillo I remember tasting. Smooth entry, large cigar box, pyrazine, wooden middle, some green freshness that ends in a  bellpepper long finish. Enough tanin to eat with. Good acidity too!!!  Would buy again and introduce to friends!!"
1332,1906277,Delicious Portuguese Red. Lots of cherry & oak. Hints of vanilla. Pretty bold but super smooth. You’ll like this one. 
1333,1906277,"Tried during wine degustation event at Martel at Bellevue (Zurich, Switzerland)"
1334,1906277,Dry sharp lots tannins red fruits red cherries 
1335,1906277,Tasted at BA wine bar Lisbon.
1336,1906277,Lovely soft oak & cherry. Make sure to respect the temperature and give it time to breath. I’m a fan.
1337,1906277,one of the best wines i ever drunk 
1338,1906277,"A pleasant red made from Aragonez also known as Tempranillo in Spain, and Tinta Roriz in the north of Portugal - a nice wine with elegant character - oak used is majority of French with little American "
1339,1906277,"Great wine, strong tannins. On the nose, leather, oak and cherry notes. On palate,  cassis, cherry, oak, vanilla and leather notes. Long finish."
1340,1906277,"Portuguese Aragonês or Spanish Tempranillo. Mas estamos em Portugal. Aquí no se habla, aqui se fala☺. So we'll call it Aragonez. Very dark ruby colour with intense already quite complex aromas of red fruits with fine nuances of toasted oak, smoke, cinnamon, nutmeg. Full-bodied on the palate with great acidity and firm vivid good tannins. Nicely multilayered lush flavours of cherry, blackberry, raspberry with gentle well integrated oak, smoke, sweet spices. Focused & well structured. Fruity-spicy aftertaste."
1341,1906277,"I think this is called Tempranillo in Spain. Deep colour, nose showing red fruit. Palate to me is pure Tempranillo, supported by good acid and gentle tannins which ensure that the tastes linger. Nice length, cleansing finish. A good food wine. Very enjoyable. "
1342,1906277,"Sampled at the excellent ‘Wines of Portugal’, Lisbon. Again, lots of red and dark fruit as ever. Chewy mouthfeel, with soft tannins that still feel a little sandy. I think this wine has excellent further ageing potential, especially given the high acidity. The wine’s let down by a short finish, but still has a great flavour. "
1343,1906277,"Deep ruby red colour, high viscosity. Very attractive nose with the aromas of forrest fruit, wood, vanilla and cacao. Elegant, fruity, smooth and long in the mouth. Good potential for ageing."
1344,1416577,"Very understated nose of black fruits, mocha and sous-bois. You just can't stop sniffing it. Well-integrated palate where the transition from the black fruit-led attack to its vanilla-oak finish is amazingly managed by its balancing acidity and booze. Masterpiece. (9.3 pts) "
1345,1416577,One of the best I’ve ever had!!!
1346,1416577,Red fruits with coffee nuances. Very well balanced. 
1347,1416577,"Dark, ruby-red color in the glass! On the nose aroma of berries, forest, with elegant notes of mocha and coffee! On the palate good freshness, evident fruit with great complexity, firm tannins and a soft, long and persistent finish! Cheers!"
1348,1416577,"Non-market wine , no. 0951/3000 , 60% touriga nacional , 35% touriga franca , 5% rufete. So balanced , black berries . Really good!🍷"
1349,1416577,Just love it...
1350,1416577,Just fantastic! Only 3.000 bottles!! 
1351,2537402,"Good taste of plums and red berries, hints of nuts and spices. Bold palate that reminds me of Tuscany wine."
1352,2537402,"A aboce average Algarve wine, a little sharp at the finish but for the price very good"
1353,2537402,Tastes better in area of origin! Had with BBQ’d steak - very good. Slight sour finish which is actually refreshing and gets you ready for another mouthful ASAP.
1354,2537402,"A decent table wine. Oak, tannins, dry but goes down nicely with your meal of choice."
1355,2537402,"Nice old world wine, balanced with a nice nutty after taste, got it from Albufeira supermarket, was delicious after dinner wine"
1356,2537402,"Creamy but acidic, petrol nose, spiced chocolate finish. Great value red."
1357,2537402,"Medium dry wine. Some tanines, some sharpness! Little over price!"
1358,2537402,Nice and tastefull
1359,2537402,"Tannins not harsh, blue fruits and a little spice... superb with chicken piri-piri which is what we had it with :-)"
1360,2537402,Wonderful wine and very reasonably priced
1361,2537402,Majority Touriga Nacional in a full bodied but smooth blend.  Full ripe red fruits with soft tannins and a long finish.  Good value again.
1362,2537402,Lovely! Well worth the purchase.
1363,2537402,"Felt a tad to acidic, flavors nice though, red fruit, oak and licorice!  Pairing with tomato based pasta or something similar would have faired better for this one! "
1364,2537402,When your on holiday all the wines taste a little better. A nice smooth red
1365,2537402,"Smooth, tannin shy. Robust body. Black fruit, blackberry. "
1366,1247055,Lovely. Dry. Fertilizer. Right up my alley. Old world.
1367,1247055,"Nice reserva, Well balanced"
1368,1247055,Very good for a Portuguese.  More balanced and less fruity than otherwise.  Which I like. 
1369,1247055,Excellent pqr. Probably most surprising wine of trip to Lisbon. Be very happy to have this again and again. Highly recommended.
1370,1247055,"Loads of fruit, berries, black and red. Florals coming through later, old American oak barrels giving roundness and soft spice. Great purple hue, low in alcohol."
1371,1247055,"Drank in Mark Jordan, superb"
1372,1247055,"Good blend of touriga nacional and cab sav. When just opened the wine was red druit dominated and a must say lacking body. A watery finish. Second glass was way better. More herbal, leather and compost. Nice tannin and a pleasant drink"
1373,1247055,"Impressive beginning. There is a pear in nose. Really hardcore and impressive beginning with lots of sharp angles (as it should be in touriga). And then..... Full body, regular finish without impressions"
1374,1247055,"Good flavors and aromas of fruit (black fruit and red fruit). Lots of oak notes. Ruby / violet color. Full-bodied, medium dry.  In terms of smell and taste, it is a pleasant red, for those who enjoy oaked  wine style (which is not really my case. I didn't apreciated very much).        Contains sulfites."
1375,1247055,Packed full of dark loveliness...try with Lindt dark chocolate with a touch of salt to pull out the cherry from the blackcurrant. Lovely! Give it some air before you drink it to open it up. Really benefits...
1376,1247055,"A beautiful dark red which needs time to breath, very aromatic on the nose and smooth on the pallet , chocolatey notes with smooth yet resounding tannins . When you drink your first sip you know your in for something special "
1377,1247055,"Medium concentation, earthy"
1378,1247055,Dark fruit sweet spices smooth tannins earthy bitter finish
1379,1247055,Fruity-red and black-like grenadine. Slight sweet spice. Balanced with a beautiful purple hue 
1380,1247055,Hich acid and not any main body. Went well with a creamy sauce though
1381,80040,"92 Aroma had dried fruit, vanilla and chocolate. Over the palate came raisins, dates, vanilla, prunes, chocolate, cocoa and figs. Medium minus acidity, medium minis tannins and sweet. Happy holidays everyone 🌲 "
1382,80040,"Bright tawny with orange flecks, there are whacks of dried fruit and sultanas on the nose, with hints of bitter chocolate and Christmas pudding. The palate is sweet but balanced with a lovely acidity. A fascinating multilayered wine, with the oxidization bringing out maple syrup flavours, coupled with leather and cigar box aromas wrapped around rich dried fruit. Complex, captivating and holding up beautifully."
1383,80040,"97p The only thing that disturbs me is a faint hint of wet dog that comes and goes. Otherwise this is almost a spiritual experience.  The aromas are so integrated and complex that is hard to put a name on. Quince marmalade, mint, herbal notes. So concentrated and intense with a very very long finish. "
1384,80040,"This has definitely matured incredibly well. Tawny coloured with brown tint. The nose is incredible with dried fruit, raisins, fruitcake, bitter dark chocolate, licorice, leather, baking spices... the list goes on. The incredible complexity extends to the palate with all the above plus cloves, allspice, rich coffee, black cherries, stewed plum and marzipan. One of the oldest ports I have tried and easily one of the best. "
1385,80040,"My oldest port to date and what a joy! Such an unexpected palate of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, leather and foggy pruney fruit, with a lingering warm spice to the finish. Not overly sweet but incredibly moreish. Wow. Incredible."
1386,80040,"X-mas spices, prune, fig and flowers, wood and vanilla. Wonderful sweet nectar!  Rounded yet fresh with minerals, vanilla, plum and fig. Very elegant and caressing, fine and dainty. Has depth, dark spices and nice fruit. Yes, this is great! 94"
1387,80040,Great combo of fruity and subtle peppery notes. Amazed at how it has kept its colour. 
1388,80040,"Pale tawny in the glass with very green and herbal notes of dried and slightly burned sprigs, brown sugar, thyme and basil. Light+ body and a short finish. Quite unusual taste for a port. Cheers! 🍷"
1389,80040,1960 was a very hot summer and so you’ve got a smooth very spicy with a very long finish port wine. It has characteristics of prunes apricots hint of spice on the nose and interestingly enough lots of roses. It is dark in colour for this age with a hint of brown I would suggest that it is very good with hard cheeses.
1390,80040,"Low alcohol, beautifully thin, hint of brandy and didn't dissapoint."
1391,80040,Very ultimately nice
1392,80040,Smooth and delicious
1393,80040,Rummaged through some boxes in my cellar last night and came across a mixed case of old ports. I guess it's kind of obvious what my birthyear is 😄
1394,80040,"From a winery founded in 1588, this Vintage Port is sensational. Elegant and balanced with notes of dark cherry, prune, balsamic, eucalyptus, and dried figs. A whiff of fallen leaves tingles the nose. A voluptuous, sensual feel caresses the mouth. Paired with Gouda cheese last night. Yup, I drank this very young and it will be at a good age in 5-8 years and will last for 30. But (1) this is a super vintage year, and (2) I’m a geezer who can’t wait!"
1395,80040,"Typically for 2003 this is a voluptuous port, relatively forward for its age. Dense, with black cherry, prune, fig and mocha. The palate is smooth and spicy, rapidly developing more savoury tobacco, tar, anise. It is not overly sweet or acidic. It doesn’t have the magical combination of intensity and complexity that characterise the best vintage ports, and like many 2003s I wouldn’t keep it indefinitely. I’m not sure it will improve; it is great to drink now. 4*+. "
1396,1323370,More fruity and elegant than I expected. 
1397,1323370,Dry fruity blue berries
1398,1323370,Jam in the nose and mouth. An aged wine but still drinkable. 
1399,5844814,"Young as a baby 👶, it has great potential for growth. Fascinating aroma, very light, fresh and clear first sip. Long long lasting aftertaste.🇵🇹🍇🍇🍇"
1400,5844814,Balanced bouquet complex of flavours and smooth on tasting great wine for tapas
1401,5844814,"Young, but already stunning. "
1402,5844814,"Lovely super-oaky wine with a strong hint of leather. Full bodied with mellow tannins, hints of plums and cherries. Long finish a variety of flavors"
1403,5844814,"This is A wine. Complex. Strong, bold, intense but elegant. "
1404,5844814,"(92/100) For sure the best of this Quinta that has only 6.5 Ha.  🍇 100% Touriga Nacional   ⏰ Aged on French and American Oak  👃 Medium intensity of red and black fruit, wood, leather   👅Very complex and deep. All the elements go along perfectly. Robust tannins and very long finish."
1405,5844814,"Dark grenade color, high concentrated and even opaque, Great aromatic complexity, prevailing  the forest black fruit and the tobacco notes. In the mouth it is full bodied,with great structure and with an impressive liveliness. Long aftertaste. Accompanied very well sorted strong cheeses. "
1406,5844814,It’s an elegant and well balanced wine. Red an black berries in the nose. We had with grilled octopus and it was a perfect match!
1407,5844814,A brilhante full bodied wine! Fruity aroma and perfect dryness.
1408,5844814,Mediumbodied with elegance

1417,1143701,A favorite of mine. 
1418,1143701,Exactly what we've come to expect from Kopke. Very good stuff. Balanced and fresh; red fruit and violet.
1419,1143701,"Winery mostly famous for its port wine.  Met body, relatively high acidity, dark fruits or even berries, slight smokiness. Soft tannins, easy to drink, short finish. Ok table red. "
1420,1143701,Fresh and young red from Douro. Great for summer bbq and homemade pizzas. Unfortunately I won’t look for it at my liquor store. 
1421,1143701,"Raspberry, black plum, leather, musty cigar box, and blackberry nose. Medium+ tannins. Medium+ acidity. Medium body. Blackberry, violet, plum, iron, and leather. Fresh black fruits and Douro oak aging blend together to make this classy Douro red. 3.6⭐️"
1422,1143701,"Crimson in color with a reddish pink rim. Nose of black cherry, black raspberry, boysenberry, and some ripe plums. Medium acidity medium tannins. This is aged for a year in oak, mostly large barrels that are neutral as there isn't much oak influence on the body. Ripe black fruit, bramble, plums, and boysenberry. Not overly complex. Some Earth and wet stone notes. "
1423,1143701,Really pleasant Portuguese red from a house that is mainly known for their Port. Red as red should be in my opinion 
1424,1143701,"Good wine, good on tannins and definitely noticed some leather and pepper notes. Dry, a very typical Douro wine, in the positive sense 👍🏼"
1425,1143701,"Very good price performance, long finish"

1430,3495737,Vinhos de Portugal @ CasaShopping 02jun2019
1431,3495737,"Very fresh almost crisp mouthfeel, a bit of acidity also there, even if has been in oak it's notable only a bit on the nose. Overall an enoyable Portuguese Chardonnay"
1432,3495737,Yeasty taste. Disappointing bread yeast 
1433,3495737,Weak...a lor of fruit but no body
1434,3495737,I thought this had enough body to balance the fruit. We liked it although a bit on the sweet side for my palate. 
1435,3495737,Paind and straight chard. nothing special about ir
1436,3495737,Very fruity complex with good acidity...high in alcool. Colour of sunshine
1437,3495737,"My rating is 3,5"
1438,3495737,Mineraly and fresh. 
1439,3495737,"Tasty, nothing much to tell about"
1440,3495737,"Frutado, excelente para os frutos do mar."
1441,3495737,Portugiese surprise! Very nice Chardonnay for an unbeatable price.
1442,1413287,"Dark chocolate, oak, blackcurrant, juniper."
1443,1413287,Rich in flavor. The aroma caught me off guard and led me to pure happiness 
1444,1413287,"This wine was made from Touriga  Nacional,Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz-Sousao and Tinta Amarela  wineyards from our best plots located in Meda Region,in the Douro Superior at about 450 meters high, Intense red color.Very fresch and fruity with notes of berries,black cherries and spices on the nose.Very concentred whith a good acidity, soft tannins,long and persistent finish on the palate.  Ageing :14 months in French of barreals."
1445,1413287,"Medium bodied wine with taste of black fruit, cherry and coffee. Enjoyable and very easy drinking wine. "
1446,1413287,Nice sample from Douro.... Easy drinking and well balanced. 👍🍷🍷
1447,1413287,Excellent and smooth. It's a must for the price
1448,1413287,"An ever reliable Portuguese red. Plummy dark body and blackcurrant nose, leading to a savoury palette hinting at coffee and mocca. Decent medium+ acidity, subtle tannins and a present medium alcohol (13.5%). A longer finish would take this to a really next level wine, but amazing value form drinkportuguesewines - yes please!"
1449,1413287,Average white from Douro. Not overly impressed. 
1450,1413287,"Light tannins, black cherry and a dark red colour. Had it in Lisbon and bought two to take home 😍"
1451,1413287,"Very nice wine, dry and good body!"
1452,1413287,"Soft taste, love it"
1453,1413287,"Fruit, light, soft. Nice in a warm day."
1454,1413287,Typical Duoro flavors and smell in this one. However quite flat and without thrill. Okayish.
1455,1413287,"Spicy, red fruits"
1456,1413287,"Very good wine. Much better after decanting. Very round, velvet with ripe red fruits aftertaste. It proved me another time that with Portuguese red wines you better take more old one (reservas)"
1457,1368836,"4.2, Full bodied, dense and thick which makes it quite opaque in the glass. Looks almost unfiltered. It reminds me of the Saperavi from Gitana, it feels like biting into the grapes. It treats your 👅 with hints of Black currant and dark chocolate. On the 👃 it's chamomile. Delicious!"
1458,1368836,"Super smooth, well integragrated tannins, little chocolate, nice solo"
1459,1368836,"Forgot about this one, unearthed it when reorganizing the wine fridge… What a discovery! ☺️😋  Nose with moist, fertile undergrowth, kirsch, black currant, prune, mokka and integrated oak followed by a very intense, powerful palate with perfect acidity, dry, constructive, bite size tannins, black cherry, black prune and black tea. Delicious, and for less than 20€ 😎! 4.4"
1460,1368836,Boa acidez. Final interessante.
1461,1368836,"Deep colour. Heavy syrupy flavours. Too much in this Algarve heat. Also tastes slightly corky - in a good way, not corked. As if it were a more mature red. Probably not been stored well."
1462,1368836,"Dry, and oaky, great full flavor wine. Great with red meat and stong cheese."
1463,1368836,Let it breathe for a few minutes before drinking to get the best out of this wine.
1464,1368836, Very good wine I enjoyed it in his bold taste with traces of so e oak vanilla and maybe dark chocolate...It is really excellent and I recommend it 
1465,1368836,Flattish and slightly burning  Some good taste under that but overall disappointing 
1466,1368836,Great wine from the south of Portugal.  A good safe buy at the price.
1467,1368836,A well worn sofa. Vanilla chocolate notes and a cookie finish. High alchohol and surprisingly low acidity. I'll be on the look out for more Herdade do Pombal.
1468,1368836,"Nice light flavour easy to drink, smooth."
1469,69734,Wowza had this sitting in the house for a few years and just gave it an airing. Sumptuous wine earthy notes but velvety smooth dark fruit. Can’t see how anyone could dislike a portugese triumph 
1470,69734,"🍷 In the glass, bloodstone ruby red   👃 In the sniffy sniff, earthy and ashy with summer fruits and notes of festive spices, cherries, red currents and mince pies with traces of oak   👅 In the mouth, very spicy with tonnes of dried fruits and packed with tannns... Blueberries, currents, raisins and glacier cherries, with licorice, star anise and oak   🥂 This port is totally outstanding, but feels just a tad unbalanced... It may be better if opened in another year or two..."
1471,69734,"Terra Feita 2001 from Taylor. A real treat! Sumptuous wine, loaded with fig, dates, sweet earth and beautiful rich extract of spice, grape jam and compote.   Lasted  (unfortunately) 2 days. A note to self: order a case!  Happy Christmas Hannukah and new year everyone!"
1472,69734,"Opened w. Steve Standbridge a couple of weeks ago & still going strong, a SQVP from the Pinhão Valley.  Deep ruby. Pronounced aroma intensity w. black cherry jam, prune, baked blackcurrant, crème de mure & violet. Black pepper, kirsch & dried dark flowers. Developing w. a slightly hot spirity note & chilli pepper.  Sweet. Rich, soft & floral. Perfumed violet, black cherry, crème de violette, damson jam & blackberry cream. High alc, full body, m+ acid, m(-) tannins & a touch of chocolate on the m+ finish."
1473,69734,"Rich port, great deep rich fruits and silky tannins."
1474,69734,Great QPR for a single quinta vintage port. Not from a declared vintage year so a great way to get to taste the dense dark opulent blackberry & cassis fruit you only get in true vintage port but without breaking the bank!  At 18 years old still has plenty of longevity & drinking beautifully now.  Be warned this stunning port throws a heck of a lot of sediment & requires careful decanting.
1475,69734,"Apologies for the short notes.  Found this, like the Vargelles 2004, to be quite hot on the alcohol for a wine of this age and status. Raisin and ripe red fruit flavours abound, and, like it's younger brother, lacks tertiary character."
1476,69734,"Its hard to believe that this fruit is 17 years since harvest - it’s massively intense with a muscular and indulgent character.  Masses of dried figs and sticky burnt sugar coat the mulberry and damson fruit beautifully.  Opulent and concentrated but not tame - this is quite a wild, brash glass of port wearing it’s gritty, sweet earthy tannins on it’s sleeve.  The alcohol was a little off-kilter on day one, but after mellowing in a decanter overnight it’s now more in tune with the spice and fruit. 4.2⭐️ 👏"
1477,69734,"For 18 months this scan has been hiding on Vivino waiting for me to rediscover it. Today I did thanks to a review of a different Taylor's Port. This was served by @[1|6118632|Andy B] at the end of an excellent evening and his TN (which I've just read) is much more useful than my scribbled note which is - Very deep dark purple. Gorgeous nose  of violets, liqourice, prune & Xmas cake. Full body, long slightly spicy finish. Still a baby, very fresh. 4⭐"
1478,69734,"Bought this for my Brothers Birthday after a bit of guidance from the staff at Majestic. Deep dark fruit flavours like plums, damsons, raisons and black cherries...perfect with mature cheeses and a bit of blue smelly Stilton. Seriously full in flavour, very jammy, very intense, very more-ish. Not a bad gift if I don’t say so myself 😀"
1479,69734,"Classic and very good now. But, will probably get much better if hold for the future"
1480,69734,"Those Chocolate candies with the booze injected inside. Rum? And whisky, too. And caramel.  After awhile I realised there was very little fruit in this one. A bit one dimensional, but tasty for the sweet tooth. "
1481,69734,"Dark purplish-red, powerful dark fruit nose with earthy and smoky notes, tannin-rich mouthful of fruit flavours giving way to dark chocolate and fig during the prolonged finish. More structured than the Vargellas SQVP, but opens nicely and well worth trying."
1482,69734,"Did not impress me. Seemed too closed to make a real impression. Lack of power, especially in the taste, which disappeared almost before it even began."
1483,69734,"Nice, smooth, mature - a bit too much alcohol in the finish"
1484,2027016,Wet stone fruit aromas of figs and apricots with caramel notes. Highly sophisticated and complex on the nose! Very high quality and rich
1485,2027016,"Flowers, ripe yellow fruits&minerals in intense aroma. Palate is full of ripe fruits&grapefruit bitterness. Oily, high acidity, nice minerality (chalky like)."
1486,2027016,"It’s very rare to find Rhein Riesling in Portugal and for that I was surprised to find this wine in Trás-os-Montes (Northeast). Freshness, disconcerting acidity and complexity. Very good wine by one of the restless winemaker, Mr. Dirk Niepoort. "
1487,2027016,Elegance in great form
1488,2027016,Thank you master Peter! Bomb!
1489,2027016,"Portuguese blend in old Coche barrels. Nice wine but too expensive in my opinion . Misses some crispy, mineral touch with malolactic finish, which is often the case with white wines in the south"
1490,2027016,"Mineral, dry, Good acidity, long finish"
1491,2027016,Clean white wine from Northern Portugal. Grapes grow at altitude on north facing slopes. Excellent with white fish.
1492,2027016,"Citrine colour and crystal clear, has  a strong mineral character which gives it freshness along with stone fruit notes and orange zests. The wood toast is discrete, awesome in the mouth, has volume and reveals a salty and mineral side. Very elegant and has a long finish with good citric notes. It is foreseen a great  ageing potential."

1494,2027016,"One of my favourite finds during a tour of Portugal, recommended by the sommelier at Alma in Lisboa. Not often you find such a good expression of this style outside of Germany. "
1495,2027016,"With a label clearly stating the family membership of niepoort the Redoma presents itself in a golden color - the bouquet is composed of mineral tones, peaches and peas after some time in the glass showing incredible power - on the palate this totally dry white shows power, comprehensiveness, intensity harmonizing perfectly with the refreshing acidity; a persistent finish, creamy and smooth finally sets the last exclamation mark ..."

1543,1176869,"This is incredibly good white, though in Portugal you won’t pay much for it. It’s a classy example of what white wines from this country can do.   Has a suggestion of Chardonnay, prominent flavours are vanilla, melon and peach, with a little oak pleasantly integrated. The Malvasia (a grape I like a lot) is very welcome in the blend. Highly recommend."

1630,6334089,"Gift from my Portuguese friend Pedro living in the Douro region. Wine made from old vines, up to 75 yrs old, various grape varieties. Still purple color, not showing its age. Aromas of black berries and fresh mint / violet, chocolate flavors. Good acidity, grippy but nice tannins. Elegant wine with good complexity. Medium to long finish. Pity of the slight alcohol finish when the wine warms up in the glass. When cooled a bit, the alcohol of 15 percent is better managed.  Thanks Pedro. "
1631,6334089,"#cherry #blackberry #cocoa #black currant  3.9 I want to say bold fruits up front but it thins out very quickly. Has the balance in notes, but perhaps it needed more decanting time. I honestly had very high hopes for this, which ended up a bit disappointing. The prices for Portuguese wines in Taiwan are quite disappointing since you know how much they mark up. Beggars can’t be choosers."
1632,6334089,"Fruity, smooth, mild tannins, good finishing. "

1635,6334089,"Another lunch with wonderful view after a stressful drive thx to a mean navigation system, seeing a theme in the Douro. Very authentic restaurant with typical local food & a very friendly owner. This solid Tinto worked well with succulent porco preto. The nose was a bit closed at first but with patience it blossomed with plum, blackberry, chocolate and prune. Same story with the palate: patience is your friend! Smooth with nice acidity, dry tannines, black pepper, ripe prune, licorice and leather. 3.9"
1636,6334089,"Deep intensity, ruby, persistent legs 14,5% abv. Nose: liquorice, spices, herbal (mint) cinnamon cookies, charred wood and tobacco, in spite of 8 years it is still developing. In the palate, superb acidity, unriped tannins, high alcohol, medium (+) body, medium intensity, short finish (just bitterness).  Good wine, can drink now but has potential for ageing."

1640,1909468,"Trip to Portuguese land with @[1|7741911|Boris Sarin] & @[1|8023512|Jeff Sauvage] (3/6).   Citric aromas (lime, grapefruit), apples, peaches & white flowers on a vanilla background. Frank & fresh attack, then some fat in the middle of the palate before a final with a hint of minerality (less marked than the 2 others). Nice wine, chiseled, which has caught our attention. If the nose is less exuberant than the previous one, the flavors are more marked on the palate & it has a crisp acidity. My rate : 3.8🌟"
1641,1909468,"Limestone, minerals. Quite a gritty nice wine. It had a slight hint of petroleum without any clinging feeling on the palate. Almost mushroom kind of taste. "
1642,1909468,Good value wine for me. Satisfying and good imitation for Burgundy if you like it big... Quite simple on fruits: predominantly apple with heavy oak and alcohol. Rich body but clean finish.

1652,1201985,"Tasted at the Real Wine Fair 2019.  Good QPR, but oak too overpowering for me. Good limestone minerality, very terroir driven wine."
1653,1201985,"Intense and elegant in the nose, with citrus, white flowers, mature fruit and honey. In the mouth, sublime and balanced, with more fruit and honey driven by minerals and citrus. The wood is perfectly integrated and the end is long and silky. Excellent and surprisingly complex white wine. "
1654,1201985,"Fresh easy-going Douro white in collaboration with Niepoort. Made from a mishmash of grapes: 20-50yo Rabigato, Códega do Larinho, Gouveio, Dona Branca, Viosinho, Bical etc on schist at 550-700m. Fermented with indigenous yeast+aged for 8moths in 10% French oak, 90% inox.  Nose: green apples and grass reminiscent of Sauvignon Blanc.  Palate: Green apple is joined by sweetness of white peach. Herbal kick with some bitterness. Slight nutty oxidative notes toward the end. Ok acidity. Pleasant and nothing more."
1655,1201985,Tried at Yateman in Porto

1661,1201985,"From Mauritius / This white port bottle was actually a gift we made to Shyamal's mum. She was really curious to taste white port, and it was a success (who wouldn't like white port anyway!)...  Gorgeous amber colour, with a nose full of aromas. Wood, oak, vanilla, spices... Overwhelming! The palate presents delicious caramel and dry fruits (sultanas) flavours. A real bounty to be served chilled."

1664,1201985,Great complex wine nicely balanced
1665,1201985,"Salty, nice nose, well balanced. "
1666,1201985,"Very light aroma on the nose. A true taste of grape on the mouth, remiscent of muscat grapes. A complex aftertaste makes for a very interesting wine. Recommended!"
1667,1756337,Complex and austere aroma.  Love it. 
1668,1756337,Pretty straight forward and a little one dimensional. 
1669,1756337,Tobacco. Barbecue. Saddle back 
1670,1756337,Another one from Douro! This time Dona Berta Reserve… wow! 5 stars to this beautiful wine. A lot of red berries plum dark chocolate… it was perfect with classic goat rice from Portugal… now in Aveiro
1671,1756337,Nice wine but too sweet and fruity for me.

1673,1756337,"Great value. Poweful, yet elegant."
1674,1368855,Power & Tanins
1675,1368855,needs some time and it I’ll be a great drinking wine
1676,1368855,"Very intense lively red colour. Mineral, wild fruits and plums both fresh and in syrup. Captivating. Elegant, sugary, fine density but very compact."
1677,1368855,"Touriga Nacional 100%. Wow. Lots of dark berries,earth, oak, blackberries and quite a lot of tannins. Can easily be stored for another 20 years. Great with a fillet of beef in Lisbon..."
1678,1368855,High tannins. And a clear touriga nacional nose and taste. With some decanting it opens. But i think it opens best if you wait another 5+ years
1679,1368855,"Very secret douro red. Varietal of over ten grapes. Winerys location differs yearly. Very powerfull and consentrated fullbodied wine. Dark cherries and berries, forest floor and floral elements with mocha on nose. Vivid acidity and bold athletic tannins with dark berries on palate. Fullbodied and complex long spicy finish. Needs about 1-2 hours aeration and benefits surely much longer cellaring. Top douro. Near 4,5 stars but today just four."
1680,1368855,"Deep dark Purple colour. very rich, dense, a balanced and clean palate, never boring. Reminds me of a great Touriga Franca wine, even though it’s made of old vines mixed grape varieties. Good wine to drink now or keep for a further 3/5 years before approaching again"
1681,1368855,Very intense red. Powerful and highly concentrated. Needs some time to open up fully and release the huge amount of flavours stuffed into this bottle. What a great wine :-)
1682,1368855,"A bit too dry at first, but with a good goat cheese pretty damn nice. Good wine."
1683,1368855,"Simply outstanding. If (unfortunately for you) you cannot visit Favaios and Quinta da Faisca yourself, then I've previously been able to get them to ship direct."
1684,1368855,"Strong, if not at nose at least at palate, on the edge to Porto in terms of nutty notes. Not my preferred expression of wine? "
1685,1368855,"Thick, full. Complex, yet simple. Heavy but not too much alcohol. Very, very nice. Berries, vanilla, plum."
1686,1368855,"Still young, with immense agin potential. Fruits, violets, cocoa, in a deep red that will become amazing with age. Extremely easy to drink now, even at 16.5% alcohol."
1687,1368855,"A lot of similarities with a good Ribera del Duero. Plum, vanilla, cloves & orange zest. Tannins still quite present, will improve with a few more years in the bottle"
1688,1368855,Secret Spot very good definitely better than the first time I tried 
1689,1189822,"Tasted straight out of the bottle, theres too much alcohol.. Gonna taste it again tomorrow, hopefully it will become more soft.."

1697,1189822,This 2001 Colheita have a beautiful light orangy/caramel red robe. Prune/caramel/dark cherry palate with long finish.  A bargain in the Colheita category. 
1698,1189822,"Surprising color, light brown with some spark in it. Nose is probably biggest surprise with pleasuring tones of dry fruits, figs, raisins, prunes, apples and honeyed walnuts. It could remind you some great aguardente with an oriental spices. Then the palate is turning you back to wine world with silky and smooth taste, with finish just opening your fantasies."
1699,1189822,"A wonderful very old Tawny again 😃 candied citrus notes, grilled nuts, sweet spices - beautiful wine with great balance and nice acidity 🍷 a must try "
1700,1189822,"Well, this is delicious! Spicy, soft and generous, a great choice by The Wine Society for their tawny port 2020 Fine Wine Champion. Pale tawny brown. Nose of date and raisin, loads of spice, with old wood, tobacco and leather. The palate starts sweet, and moves through dried cherry to a crescendo of clove, nutmeg and cinnamon. The mouthfeel is very soft, the acidity is high and in perfect balance, and it carries the alcohol better than most ports. Good intensity and length. Excellent port. Bottled in 2020."
1701,1189822,Very faded brown color. On the nose typical port scents of figs and almonds. Lean and elegant on the palate with a subtle alcohol kick at the end. A very nice port indeed.
1702,1189822,Plums and vanilla. Very soft and short aftertaste

1705,1153075,"👁 deep clear ruby purple  👃 fig, prune, raisin, almond and  cigar box 👅 stewed raisins, figs, plum and dried black cherry 🍒 with toasted hazelnuts and baking spice. Very full bodied and sweet with medium acidity, light silky tannins, medium plus complexity and finish 20% alcohol. From single vintage 2001, aged in oak until bottled in 2019, 7 years is minimum required. Compared it with a 20 y/o Taylor Fladgate Tawny and the Tawny seemed richer and smoother with some caramel, all fig and raisin. ✅ 247. "

1708,1153075,"2001, tasted 2021: Very enjoyable colheita with notes of walnut, dried figs and well-integrated oak. Not as deep and characteristic as the best old tawnies, but much more affordable. Four solid stars. Drink now-2025."
1709,1153075,"87 Aroma had sweet dried fruit, light cedar and vanilla. Over the palate came raisins, figs, dates, cedar, prunes and vanilla. Medium acidity, low tannins and sweet. "
1710,1153075,"Medium to light red port wine has chocolate black cherry with almonds.  Very intense lightly caramelized nose with oaky, creamy finish !!"
1711,1153075,"Like raisins or figs. Sweet but not syrupy, full bodied. "
1712,1153075,"This fine Colheita is way better than the price indicates. You can really enjoy this to almost anything, and taste the years in the barrel."
1713,1153075,Lovely orange zest note in this smooth and tasty Colheita. It works very well with most desserts or as a dessert on its own ⭐️👌😁⭐️
1714,1153075,"Delightful fruit sugars leap out of a glass of dried fig, almond, dried black cherry. Slightly nutty finish. I thought even a touch of tropical fruit such as mango."
1715,1153075,"For a non-dessert wine it was quite refreshing. Sweet body (duh), but a citrus-y finish."
1716,1153075,Pretty good. Raisin tones and smooth caramel but missing something. 
1717,1153075,"Better than ratings suggest. Solid 4.2, just not quite 4.5. Why? Lovely smooth colheita with fragrant nose and pleasant mature flavors. Lacks only a bit of depth and complexity to be truly special. That said, this is a beautiful drinking, even if somewhat limited, port wine. Serve slightly chilled."
1718,1153075,"Very nice, smooth, not heavy. Nuttiness, some orange and a bit of tropical fruit."
1719,3595605,Good acid balance with notes of melon and pineapple fruits. Flinty minerality. Would do well with shellfish in the sunshine. Saúde!
1720,3595605,"Truly good. Peach and citrus, an acidity that smacks the lips and balances the fruitiness makes it a really good choice for both meals and stand-alone drink. Great finish."
1721,3595605,"(4.0) Elegant and bone dry Dăo Reserva. Oak aged, 2017 ready to enjoy.   Encruzado driven (second grape Malvasia) comes with creamy dry approach. Toffee notes appears on first sip followed by citrus, stone fruit, green herbs and flinty minerals. Medium full on the palate, very complex with taste in layers.  Good dry acidic ending with some bitter notes and floral notes.  Great wine!    "
1722,3595605,"Crystalline strong citrus yellow color,denoting some evolution.  Fruity aroma (peach, melon and citrus) with notes of toast and spices.  In the mouth have a marked taste, and it is elegant and balanced, with beautiful notes of wood.  Medium aftertaste. Good value for the money."
1723,3595605,"Citrine color. Aromas of sweet spices, peach fruit and lemon peel. Elegant, refreshing and balanced on the palate with a finish reminiscent of creamy white chocolate and biscuits and lasting grip in the mouth. "

1729,3595605,"Dry, but really good balance. "
1730,3595605,Very good. Dense. The presence of peach flavor really stands out.
1731,3595605,"Rumours have it that this Quinta is sold to a bigger winery and so they don’t make wine in their own name anymore... If that is correct, it’s too bad and imho a stupid commercial decision. Why? This Quinta has wines with potential and I think the Dão region is still growing when it comes to quality in wine... Anyway, I like the unique, oily texture in this wine. The greasy matter counters the citric acidity and gives it a mouthfilling sensation which paired great with baked white fish."
1732,3595605,Really nice taste and very special through mix of sherry taste and barique.
1733,3595605,"Very good wine. Perfect integration of wood, mineral, fresh, and yet medium weight and great medium long finish that just has the perfect balance"

1736,4849471,"88/100 Antão Vaz and Arinto fermented for three to four weeks and aged in used oak for six months. Very clean orange wine, notes of sweet peach, lemon, and orange peel. Not an intense orange wine but it is crisper and cleaner. Easy drinking with low tannins. Great introduction to the genre."
1737,4849471,"Unusual white wine.   Cask is presented right away. Nicely zesty, a bit astringent. Refreshing but with an unusual body.   A bit too expensive at JPY 1900  (Feb 2021). "
1738,4849471,Orange wine. Dallas.  Soft with dry finish. Let it open for more butter and nut notes
1739,4849471,"Quite drinkable, very easy to drink. Yellow peach, hint of unripe apricot, a bit of citrus somewhere in the background. Doesn’t have prominent characteristics of amber wine in a good way that probably appeals to wider range of casual wine drinkers rather than an amber wine aficionado. 3.3 for me"
1740,4849471,"Interesting wine, get it if you’re in a group who want something different.  Oeno Vino  Really funky orange wine. Super sulfur, mineral nose with secondary notes of orange peel and honey.  The palate was light bodied and dry. Mostly mineral and oak. A little fruit on the back end with surprising tannin on the long finish "
1741,4849471,Much better 2nd day but doesn’t really taste like an orange wine to me! More like a rose. Maybe very light maceration. Pleasant but not too interesting. 
1742,4849471,"This wine goes down ((too easily) is this wrong?  I have never said this, before...).  Underripe peach skin, verbena leaves and nectarine pit.  White flowers on the nose, lackluster on the palate."
1743,4849471,"Amber, transparent. Toasted nuts or caramel or orange peel. Smooth and dry tongue, well-mineralized.  Feels like I’m in a dusk seashore."
1744,4849471,"Orange is the new rosé! (And Vivino considers it white, truly a wine for the color blind) Nose with mandarin, watermelon and red cherry followed by a superdry palate with nice tannines, strawberry and a little oxidation. I liked it more than I imagined... good with some manchego cheese. 3.7"
1745,4849471,First orange wine for me ever. Too early to say anything
1746,4849471,Remarkable colored wine with an exquisit taste. Cherries and caramel on the nose. Fresh fruits

1759,1413287,"An ever reliable Portuguese red. Plummy dark body and blackcurrant nose, leading to a savoury palette hinting at coffee and mocca. Decent medium+ acidity, subtle tannins and a present medium alcohol (13.5%). A longer finish would take this to a really next level wine, but amazing value form drinkportuguesewines - yes please!"
1760,1413287,"Very good wine. Much better after decanting. Very round, velvet with ripe red fruits aftertaste. It proved me another time that with Portuguese red wines you better take more old one (reservas)"

1820,2951796,"Deep red color with fantastic tearing. Oak, dark chocolate and forest berries nose with a dry finish that is typical to Douro reds. Pairs with red meats, game, strong cheese and fatty seafood. "
1821,2951796,Elegant and smooth... Good Douro! 
1822,2951796,Hint off-flavor reminiscent of prunes of prematurely aged red wines. Some might like it 
1823,2951796,Very good wine. Light and easy. Perfect for lunch and tapas! 
1824,2951796,Sintra Portugal Tapas Bar - amazing
1825,2951796,"Nice, but a little too soft"

1827,2014778,Great cost...Good wine.
1828,2014778,I really enjoyed this. The nose was unassuming but the palate was pure vanilla shortbread and lemon curd!  Def good value! 
1829,2014778,"Eyes: Pale lemon  Nose: Medium aromas of apple, lemon, tangerine, peach  Palette: Dry, high acidity, medium-bodied, medium finish"
1830,2014778,Grass and grapefruit. Good by itself or with fish.
1831,2014778,Ridiculous value for money. On the sharp side but with fresh fish at lunchtime. Bring it on. 
1832,2014778,"A new experience for me, and I certainly enjoyed it. Such a unique profile. Certainly high in acidity, but with a strong fruity character that I had a hard time putting my finger on. Like I said, unique, but tasty! We had it with a variation of Italian wedding soup."
1833,2014778,"Aromatics are popping but the palate is missing acid, and flavour. Nose is grapefruit, grass, stale honey, and soil. "
1834,2014778,"Dry with good concentration, although quite simple."
1835,2014778,Interesting use of Arinto grapes in Alentejo terroir. Sharp
1836,2014778,  peach apple lemon curd 
1837,2014778,"Would consider this a lighter, smoother Chardonnay.  Still full bodied and Oakes.  Very good."
1838,2014778,"Branco do Alentejo!  Citrino brilhante. Pêra, pêssego e mel no nariz. Na boca é cítrico e mineral, com um toque de romã. Lembra um Chenin Blanc do novo mundo. Acompanhou massa ao alho e óleo. __ White from Alentejo!  Brilliant citrine yellow. Pear, peaches and honey in the nose. Palate is citric and mineral, with a hint of pomegranate. Feels close to a Chenin Blanc from the new world. Paired with pasta aglio i olio."
1839,2014778,Ok bit over powering. Important to serve cooled. Abit too much acid
1840,2449147,Good wine to accompany our midnight pizza
1841,2449147,Green apples with a floral finish.
1842,2449147,"Marisa says: ""I could definitely taste the Verde. Very good white table wine with bread & cheeses."""
1843,2449147,A greeny straw Portuguese white with white flowers and oak in the nose. A sweet entry in a unctuous wine. With personality but short.
1844,2449147,Really light wine with green apple notes. Light oak finish. Tastes like a light Chardonnay.
1845,2449147,"Fruity, smooth to drink, good aroma"
1846,2449147,Verry Good for drinking at the pool
1847,2449147,"Bit of sherry taste, decent but would probs choose sherry over this"

1853,2134005,Lovely fruity wine. Currently drinking a bottle at the vineyard restaurant. €29 a bottle.
1854,1293373,"🇵🇹 Dry and fruity. Oak, cherry, black fruit, blackberry, some chocolate maybe? Quite a lot of tannins. "
1855,1293373,"Surprisingly soft for an Alentejo red wine, but very, very pleasant!"
1856,1293373,"Wrong black fruit taste, not too acidic, vanilla taste"
1857,1293373,"Wine tasting night, bottle number 3. 👃 bold, rich and fresh with cherry as the most present note.  🍷 I am not a fan of wines from the souther region, although this one is quite special. Well balanced, medium bodied but it feels light. Low acidity and good tannins.  Highly recommend!!"
1858,1293373,Interesting Portuguese wine from the big wine area of Alentejano.  Full of zesty flavours and yet after 8 years it’s still a little tannic.  It’s quite a big wine really so not for the faint hearted.  🍷🍷🍷🍷
1859,1293373,"Drinking very well. Good PQR. Wood nicely balanced, fresh dar currant fruit, slightly dry and showing a tiny bit of warmth, but good integration and nice smooth tannins. Will further age for at least 3/5 years"
1860,1293373,Amazing nectar. You won't regret it. Had it with red meat and it was fantastic. 
1861,1293373,"The first bottle that opened of this wine didn't pleased that much. But now after 5 years of purchuase i had a good surprise. Chocolate aroma, strong colour. Well balanced in acidity and sweat. About texture it is like velvet, very smooth. "
1862,1293373,Excelente deep taste and very sensitive .
1863,1293373,"Good blend from Alentejo of four varieties (TN, AB, Aragonez and Syrah) and 12 months aging in French and American oak barrels. Intense ruby, aroma of ripe dark red fruits, spices, vanilla and toast. Medium+ body, soft, medium to high acidity, long finish."
1864,1293373,"Great taste of wild berries , black currant and spices with a dry palate that sticks.a good one."
1865,1293373,"Dense ruby. Lots of fruit on the nose. Extremelly fresh but with evident afternotes of vanilla, chocolate and berries. Long finish. Rememberable wine! "
1866,1293373,"A lot of ripe red fruit, chocolate, quite intense and lush."
1867,1293373,(4.2) Vinhos do Alentejo no Downtown.
1868,1293373,"Intenso, acidez natural com tons citrinicos e aroma intenso"
1869,2166743,Much to like here. Acidity on point and fruit for days. No messing around with American Oak. No funny stuff. Just decent winemaking. Five stars.
1870,2166743,This is the style of red wine I like!  Robust with deep dark fruits but with depth and quite some maturity. I ponder on whether it was a 3.5 or 4 rating but decided on the latter because of its complexity and good value. I’m impressed by the quality of inexpensive Portuguese wines I’ve found this week. 
1871,2166743,"3,9. Fruity and dry. Thought it would be a little smoother... "
1872,2166743,"Bold and fruity, wooded and smokey, tobacco and smoke.  Great tannins!"
1873,2166743,"Medium body, smooth wine full of fruit, mostly blackberries and vanilla . Delicious!"
1874,2166743,What a wine! Slight effervescence. Massive punch of berry coming through. Tannins are there but not too much and it is quite complex and structured. Little bit of Tobacco and little hit of vanilla.  This is a lovely wine. Worth a case on first taste. 
1875,2166743,"Red berries, tobacco"
1876,2166743,"Very easy drinking, with light tones of amber"
1877,2166743,"Excellent Vin de cette appelation, très intense bouquet fruis rouges"
1878,2166743,"Another great Duoro. Concentrated, good tannins, still needs some rest to soften. Beautiful"
1879,2166743,"Young beauty and the beast: As far as you can see, terroir covered with colored terraces up the hill. Jean Hughes Gros, a painter of this wine, is a Frenchman who fell in love with Douro and decided to stick around and make very good wines. Quinta Dona Francisca is his most recent project. The owner of the winery is António Augusto Ferreira, a former master brewer at Unicer. His passion for Douro land and wine led him to leave the previous life, made around the beers. Look at the wine reveals deep ruby..."
1880,2166743,"Another great one from Douro. A mature wine wine with taste of ripe dark fruits like plum and black currant, hints of oak and tobacco. Dry palate with a tasty palate."
1881,2166743,An elegant Douro wine that will bring joy in any occasion. Perfect tannins structure enable an excellent ending. Notes of plum and oak. Some small hints of vanilla. An excellent wine! AK
1882,2166743,Inky black blueberries with some sexy legs. Cheeky and chewy. A delicate wine from the Douro with tannins around the mid palate and a finish lending itself to fudge or prunes. Great value...maybe another .5 stars is deserved for price alone.
1883,2166743,A good douro wine
1884,1829667,"Very interesting Blanc de Blancs Méthode sparkling from Portugal 🇵🇹  👁 Light gold with delicate to large bubbles 👃  Dried apple, cream, honey and bitter almond. Distinct yeast and warm bread aromas which is not surprising for this 8 year old wine. 👅 Creamy mouthfeel with aromas of yellow apple, cream and perfectly balanced grapefruit acidity. Note: The arinto grapes are fermented “sur lie” for six months. Degorgement is after 5 years of fermentation in the bottle! "
1885,1829667,"Love this very good Portuguese sparkling! Body, yeast, balance, always a great choice!"
1886,1829667,Honey ... citrus ... toast ... little bit of resin ... small bubbles ... Arinto grapes ... from 2012 grapes ... okay but I expected more
1887,1829667,Fresh Dry Bubbles wine From Alentejo Methodo Classico! Blind it would beat a lot of French Champagne!
1888,1829667,"Lovely golden colour reminiscent of the sun setting over the hills outside Évora. Medium density mouse making it perfect accompaniment with canapés and such. Fresh taste with a hint of oak to ground the flavor. Cartuxa a reliable producer, will be back for more"
1889,1829667,Would  be good with smoked salmon
1890,1829667,Very enjoyable for sparkling
1891,1829667,Happy new year My Friends !!!!!

1893,1829667,Soft dry creamy delightful fizz. Best we’ve drunk in Portugal. Hard to find but worth the effort.
1894,1829667,At enoteca Cartuxa.  Really good as just a glass with nothing.  Nicely aged.  Honey.  Good 7 year-old.  5.25 €/ glass (again huge glass)

1896,1829667,"Full creamy toasty nose with aroma of apples. Good acidity, maybe a little short on the palate."
1897,1829667,"Excellent finale of the wnd. My first 'champanoise' from Cartuxa. Monovariatal Touriga National. Copper rose in the glass with concistent, white foam - big bubbles at the beginning converting to endless, fine perleage later. Flowery notes on the nose with subtle red fruit, dried apple, pear keeping the gates. Very dry, savory, acidic on the palate. Excitingly refreshing with a subtle drop of bitterness. Salinity&minerality's the ID on a mouthfeel. V.nice bubbly! 4 points from our sunny terrace today. "
1898,1829667,"Brightly golden with intense yeast notes on the nose, this sparkling Arinto is probably not for everyone but I enjoyed it. Toast, cream and honey notes throughout, big bubbles."
1899,2392324,"Acidic nose. Nice and chalky, citric with tropical fruit (maybe guava) and a floral finish. Crisp acidity and a good level of dryness. Best Portuguese white I’ve had so far. "
1900,2392324,Spectacular Alvarinho with great minerality and complexity. It's first approach is a mind blowing one with the palate full of slightly tropical fruits and very citric with a long very pleasant but clean finish. Very present and scented. Great PQR... Great wine
1901,2392324,In the glass Pale clear yellow  On the nose minerals bread chalk sea salt aroma composted Grass  On the palate minerals salty mild acidity Slightly restricted but develops in the glass Drank by the banks of the Douro river on a warm summers evening accompanied by a Fado Singer 
1902,2392324,Very nice Portuguese style wine.  Nose is definitely on the acidic side but first sip was full moth of apple and citrus.   Had this in Porto with a caprese salad.  The acidity paired well with the tomatoes.  The finish was citrus and some floral notes.  Great wine overall. 
1903,2392324,"Clean & delicate citrus nose, citrus more prevalent on the palate with a note of pomelo towards the end. Good minerality and acidity. Light and quaffable, highly recommend. "
1904,2392324,"Tropical fruit nose, crisp, balanced and good mouthfeel."
1905,2392324,"Light, fresh and crispy."

1908,2392324,"Light and balanced, fruity and floral on the nose. Very soft notes of citrus on the palate. Recommended by the owner and didn't disappoint. :)"
1909,2392324,Minerals and citrus is overtaking 
1910,2392324,Fruity. Lightly sweet. Lemon
1911,2392324,Such a surprising Alvarinho! Not too sure it the year's haven't taken its edge off but it is definitely on of the best Alvarinhos I have ever drunk!
1912,2392324,Nice albarino...good wine to tease spanish friends

1917,1305159,"Bistro Barão lunch in Evora. 1/2. This Chardonnay and Sauvingon Blanc from Alentejo with 8 m FR barrel aging did not meet iur expectations. C: pale straw. N: very shy, line. Clorh, passion fruit, vanilla. P: light, a bit watery, though slightly oily too, medium finish. Gets better when warm instead of cold. / Comida en Bistro Barão. 1/2.

1924,1305159,Smoky and woody....
1925,1305159,The Cork was not good ; the wine stays with the flavour of cork ; perhaps it was a great wine 
1926,1998858,"Round flovour, balanced. Tropical fruits, wild strawberry, and acidity are noticeable. So, well done blend but nothing special for 10e. And tannins fine!"
1927,1998858,"Visual: light and bright yellow core with a colorless halo, limpid. Olfactory: lychee, melon, pear, white flowers. Palate: confirms the smell and delivers some minerality and pineapple. Medium intensity, medium persistence, medium body, high acidity, medium alcohol."

1929,1998858,"Citrine yellow color.  little pronounced aroma, with floral notes. In the mouth is fresh, with a  enveloping acidity. Short finish."
1930,1998858,"Light dry, fresh and easy to drink"
1931,1998858,"Dry, very fresh, herbaceous, light on fruit, flowery. Full in the mouth, acidity long lasting unlike the flavor. Wax, light smoke, herbs, tastes like it could have been on barrels a bit and it wasn’t and mineral. Interesting but not my glass of wine."
1932,1998858,"Valle de pasos tras os montes 2017 Medium lemon. Butter, lemon, high acidity, dry. Smooth. Like Chardonnay - slightly Oaked, vanilla, slate, wet stones, minerality. Complex, average length. 4"
1933,1998858,"Dry, fruity, little spicy white wine. Rather flat nose but largely compensated while tasting. Flavors of peach, apple, lychee and spices. "
1934,1998858,"Douro wines tasting meeting. #1- White wine from Trás-os-Montes region made of Viosinho + Codega de Larinho + Malvasia grapes aged for 3 months in bottles. Very clear straw yellow color. Intense floral and yellow fruit and citric aromas with notes of minerals, dried nuts and, lately, butter. Medium-body (13.0%), quite fruity and delicious wine, with perfect acidity and alcohol. Finish is mid-dry, intense, elegant and very persistent. Beautiful Portuguese wine!! Fully deserves 86-GB pts!! 👏👏 "
1935,1998858,"(3.8) Interesting this white wine from Valle de trás os montes, I've never tried wines from there. On the nose  Is fruity, citrus like lemon, minerals, and salt. On the palate is light and dry, has great acidity and short finish. Cheers 🍷"

1942,1189822,"Really nice, caramel overtones. No aftertaste. "
1943,1189822,Very faded brown color. On the nose typical port scents of figs and almonds. Lean and elegant on the palate with a subtle alcohol kick at the end. A very nice port indeed.
1944,1189822,"Since Para was gone, we replaced it with this beautiful Barros and paired with Vaniglia del Madagascar ice cream😍😍 Big cheers my friends🍷🍷"
1945,1189822,"Surprising color, light brown with some spark in it. Nose is probably biggest surprise with pleasuring tones of dry fruits, figs, raisins, prunes, apples and honeyed walnuts. It could remind you some great aguardente with an oriental spices. Then the palate is turning you back to wine world with silky and smooth taste, with finish just opening your fantasies."

1949,1189822,"Well, this is delicious! Spicy, soft and generous, a great choice by The Wine Society for their tawny port 2020 Fine Wine Champion. Pale tawny brown. Nose of date and raisin, loads of spice, with old wood, tobacco and leather. The palate starts sweet, and moves through dried cherry to a crescendo of clove, nutmeg and cinnamon. The mouthfeel is very soft, the acidity is high and in perfect balance, and it carries the alcohol better than most ports. Good intensity and length. Excellent port. Bottled in 2020."
1950,1189822,"4.5🌟     1️⃣9️⃣7️⃣8️⃣    FOR   1️⃣9️⃣7️⃣8️⃣   First Port out of four on this countdown. Classic mix of even TB/TR/TF/TN. Bottled as late as 2011.😮🤔 Dark amber-pale brown color, F body.

1953,1189822,"Quite nice old Colheita. Nutty, but also lots of tertiary aromas."
1954,1189822,"This beautiful 1966 colhetta port is one of the great nectars of the Barros house and is a rare and poetic treat! It is rich with historical significance and the aroma and palate profiles follow suit. Pecan pie and boiling spices of clove and aged orange rind, intense vanilla and maple and breakfast pancakes, and aged walnut wood china cabinet. It's acidity is beautifully preserved and its finish is evocative of a colonial bakery in full swing with nutty sweet glazed delicacies wafting around you. Enjoy!!"
1955,1189822,This 2001 Colheita have a beautiful light orangy/caramel red robe. Prune/caramel/dark cherry palate with long finish.  A bargain in the Colheita category.

1960,5257272,"Sweet citrus on the nose, oak mineral in the mouth. Great Bairrada white. "
1961,5257272,"Peppery mineral nose. Thick, silky body with fine tannins that tug lightly at the finish. Spices and dark mature fruit, calcareous with plenty of acid, a sip goes down easy but leaves you wanting another. I suppose it might be nice with some more age but its very enjoyable at this moment. "
1962,5257272,Green apple on those and flavour; depth in the taste
1963,5257272,"This was an excellent, dry white wine. It was classified as a red which was incorrect."

1969,5257272,"4.5/5.0. My WOTN at our work team dinner. Complex on the nose and palate with well-integrated French oak. Rich notes of plum, licorice, vanilla and spiced cola. Really an amazing wine and very good QPR. "
1970,5257272,Rich deep with wonderful tannins 
1971,6062352,"Enjoyed at the end of fantastic dinner at Zén. Didn’t take formal notes, but interesting to try aged white port like this. If served blind you could easily be fooled by the colour development (very dark).  Paired well with a range of Petit Four. "
1972,6062352,"Unique single cask white port. Almost a dark tawny colour. Plums, dried fruit. Good acid to balance out the sweetness, silky and smooth. Quite spectacular and very special. "
1973,6062352,"Helped @[1|5458493|Mrs Ambassador Petrolhead] finish her glass before the clock struck 1030pm. Younger of the two ports, and only 4 years younger than anand. This was richer, fuller bodied... roasted almonds, dried fruit, molasses... I thought this was a tawny.  "
1974,6062352,Zen pairing. This was a treat. White port! Deep color though. Tasty.
1975,6062352,I have nothing especially intelligent to say about this white Porto. 
1976,6062352,Powerful and tasty!
1977,6062352,"Unfortunately, the lack of education leads to lack of taste sensitivity. What is supposed to be a unique Port did slightly put me off track. Worth keep Learning "

1983,1136261,"A house well know by their colheiras ports - pale color, sweet almost coconut notes, light spicy profile, a precise wine with some elegance, drier style, almost iodine notes, medium bodied - a fine port with a good balance but could be a bit richer #portwineday #winelover"

1992,1136261,Amazing. Caramels. Butterscotch
1993,1136261,"Not overjoyed. Nutty and quite weak, sweet and not too many tannins."
1994,1136261,"Brown sugar with an oloroso back drop. Very subdued sweetness with notes of flor, walnuts and acetone. More like a semi dulce Marsala than a Colheita, really. It is not that it is bad, it is just not what you want from a colheita. Of course 1976 is not a VP year, which might explain it, but considering the price-tag this wine is not recommendable. In comparison the 1975 Burmester is a 4 star effort at half the price..."
1995,1136261,Great port so awesome butterscotch Carmel
1996,1136261,"Brown sugar,  dried fig and Raisin in perfect combinantion.  "
1997,1136261,"Pocas still use foot treading for their Colheita tawnies, with the juice aged in old 625l Portuguese oak barrels. This 1997 is quite woody and spicy. Loads of fruit and flavour, prune and fig richness cut by citrus peel. Tobacco, leather, vanilla. Good length. Very high acidity, but it works in combination with the confident, generous style. Full of personality, and well-priced. I find Pocas a bit hit and miss; this one is a hit 🍷👍"
1998,1144184,"Magnificent!  Delicious.  Bought in 2003 and opened yesterday.  Maintained all its aroma, strong notes of vanilla, sweet but not to much. Perfect"
1999,1144184,Still great colour and taste
2000,1144184,"Beautiful barrel-aged Port for 9 years, aged in the bottled for nearly 34. Amber in colour, notes of raisins and nutmeg. Best Port I've tasted so far."
2001,1144184,Just loved it
2002,1144184,"At a very hefty price tag, this super amazing port, enjoying warsaw summer afternoon"
2003,1144184,"Excellent, i have no words!"
2004,1144184,"3.5 I was prepared to write sad notes about how pity to open anyhow old Port and didn't receive expected emotions from it then I checked notes by Jelle (sorry, I will go back after to write the name correctly) from Netherlands and red MY FEELINGS! Almost, of course. And about wine only. This tawny juice has Port's aftertaste only! Even 3+ for this. No complexity, no balance and dried plums juice mixed with warm water. The bottle was ok, please, don't even start! Yes, Colheita, not the Vintage and so??? 🤐🤑"
2005,1144184,"Drank this wine from my birth year with my parents, my brother and my godfather and godmother. From memory: light brown. Faded glory. Liquid raisins, touch of caramel. 3* because of the company I shared this with."
2006,1144184,Nuts aromas. Almonds to hazelnuts. Cigars box.  Smooth. No fruit compare to a young tawny. Vanilla. Spices. A really well balance and enjoyable long finish that remember chocolate. 
2007,1144184,"From previous visit to Portugal but kept for a round number: nr. 3️⃣5️⃣0️⃣0️⃣! This was the oldest wine I tried and although it was detroned today (see notes tomorrow!) it will always have an emotional connection considering it was put on cask in 1948 (both my parents’ birthyear) and in a bottle in 1974 (my birthyear)! Upon pouring we were very worried about the, Frankly, dirty & ugly light brown color. It turns out this is not so strange according to the ‘aloirado’ description on the label meaning ‘blondish’.🔽🔽🔽🔽"
2008,1144184,"Brick red/orange/caramel color. Nose is caramel/mellow toffee with hazelnut and sultana raisins. Palate is at first a sharp caramel burnt flavor with a smooth raisin, toffee and nutty complexity that evolves throughout the palate. A nice sharp long finish with med  acidity and soft tannins. Excellent port."

2020,3249890,"Dry, red fruit, slight notes of minerals. This was my first rosé from the Douro. Very acidic and surprisingly full bodied. "
2021,3249890,Fruity but just dry enough.
2022,3249890,Good and tasted
2023,1480880,"What a surprise! A very typical red from Douro, a blend where Touriga Nacional shines with its earthiness and complexity. A real steal!"
2024,1480880,"Nice, balanced medium bodied wine. Improves with breathing."
2025,1480880,"Yes it’s lovely and typically Portuguese in so far as it’s different to all the identikit wines out there Smoky, savoury and herby"
2026,1480880,"Nice QPR, fairly intense robust red, full bodied with ripe dark fruit aromas and flavors of cherry and plum.  Solid daily drink. 83 pts"

2029,1480880,Strong but fruity wine. Goes well with meat. 
2030,1480880,Taste is ok but smells a bit of acetone. Perhaps I just bought a bad bottle
2031,1480880,"Smooth, earthy, herbal, dry. Tastes good. "
2032,1480880,After 9 years one can clearly see its old look (light color and plenty of sediment) and taste. Looking are other users ratings I can only guess it gets much better with age. A 4.5 imho.

2038,1657125,"Good balance, smooth but tasty wine, with a nice aroma. Amazing wine!"
2039,1657125,"PT grapes - an alphabetical assortment (#22/22 - Viosinho): I'm not sure if they've changed the concept here but while the online info (for the 2016) talks about an altitude wine (600m), looking notably high on acidity (7.10g/l / pH3.00), the label for this the 2017 says it's 'predominantly' from high ground. Anyway, there's still a decent piquancy of acidity which, combined with a subtle nose, good body, and a fine, balanced palate of preserved lemon and citrus peel, makes for a classy product. (14% abv)."
2040,1657125,"Excellent minerality and clean finish, a tad light in depth perhaps but on a summer’s day eating outside. Fabulous. "
2041,1657125,"Nice Douro white, better than the one I had for lunch… richer with more profound aromas. Burgundy notes of vanilla oak, custard cream and flowers. "

2049,1193471,"84/100 Great robust wide nose of oaky fruit, where the Dialog had a vertical nose if that makes sense. Served chilled and had good balance, lacking some acid perhaps but good fruit."
2050,1193471,"WOTN for Portugal vs Spain theme; all blind. This was the only Portugese, 100% Touriga National and what a stunner it was... Soft, lively, mix of light and dark fruits, fully integrated, complimenting acidity, so fresh, so yummy and so cheap! Wow"

2070,1227634,"Careful with this one... I first tasted it in 2013. I loved it. 6 years later I found 2 stranded bottles one of which I am tasting now. The wine is still superb!, what has lost in fruit has gained in character. It is full scale earthy now with the oak showing off and just about the right amount of brett (if you like that sort of thing. I do). It would be interesting to see where this will be in 5 years but I’d have i all now"

2155,5031843,A grand wine (not having its true status - yet) - a true hymn to Douro. More masterpieces as this (and less of those 'wannabes' that pop-up abundantly) would give to Portugal its natural recognition.
2156,5031843,Nice round fruity wine. The red from the same vineyard is better for our taste but this is still a lively fresh white wine.

2190,5296311,"Cloudy straw almost like beer. Aromas like a blue moon beer, a smidge of orange/kumquat, chamomile, beeswax, yeast, bruised apple. Palate is balanced with nice roundness and lots of autolytic, beer like flavor. Dry, M+ acid, M- alcohol. This was aged in amphora lined w beeswax.

2276,1169184,"Deep ruby in colour.  Strong in nose. Fruity, floral, violet, jam, spicy. Dry-off in mouth. High in tannins, full-bodied.  Balanced in acidity although high in alcohol (14.5). Trincadeira also known as Tinta Amarela. Great Portuguese red. "
2277,1169184,"3,9⭐Good Trincadeira monovarietal from Setúbal. 👀Dark ruby with brownish rims. Abundant and slow tears. 👃Intense and pleasant with black plum, black cherry, jam, toast and walnut. 👅Balanced, medium-full body, dry. Robust tannins and medium acidity. 🏁Medium-long finish with toast, oak and nutmeg. 🗒️The nose is slightly better than what it delivers on the mouth, but nevertheless a great wine.🙂 Still far from the Trás-os-Montes Tinta-Amarela I had in August though."

2279,1169184,"Dark Red Portuguese wine reserve from 100% tricandeira grape, 14.5% alcohol, produced by Casa Ermelinda Freitas, from Setúbal in Portugal. Good for guard on long time, included up to 9 years it’s good enough ! Cheers 🍷"
2280,1169184,"My first Trincadeira varietal wine. Very good idea from Casa Ermelinda Freitas to vinify traditional Portuguese varieties and bottle them this way. This is a dark chocolate bar set with prune. Consistent and powerful, though not complex. Those 14.5 ABV will knock you down."
2281,1169184,"Dark ruby colour. Nose - ripe berries with leather and kind of petrol. Taste- ripe grapes, plums, herbs and you can feel oak"
2282,1169184,Solid Malbec like wine! Loved it.
2283,1169184,This wine is cost benefit. Its price is reasonable. Its taste and tannins will surprise  you. There is a wood taste with ripe red fruits flavor as plum. Ruby color and very smooth wine. It is worth tasting it.
2284,1169184,"Very dark cloudy crimson coloured to the edge with thick clear legs. Nose of black and red fruit - rhubarb, plum, blackberry - and some oaky vanilla. Just off dry, with elevated alcohol and acid and fairly subdued tannins. In the mouth, nice blackberry flavours and some fairly hefty oak - perhaps a little heavy handed. Medium bodied and medium length. Interesting example of Trincadeira grape - though not the usual hefty tannins. "
2285,1169184,"Cranberry citric nose, some wood and slight oxidation. Dry palate, with some wet wood  aftertaste. More and better to be found between  Casa Ermelinda Freitas wines IMHO Next day notes , it improves, more gentle, smoother"
2286,1169184,"92 points - Very good, 14.5%, oak, balsamic and cranberry notes, gorgeous color, tobacco leaves on the nose, strong and intense taste, overall a very enjoyable wine that still has a lot of room to age very well"

2291,1245309,"Always exiting, home alone with a 19 year old Portuguese named Colares. Colares is either a ginger or brunette and smells herbs and leather. Taste of fruit and some tannins with a salty, long, fruity aftertaste. Looking forward enjoying more of beautiful Colares."
2292,1245309,"Dried fruit, licorice, leather, tobaco and oak on the nose. Taste is a little sharper and more closed than year 2000. Quite much power, but yet fruity and some smoothness there is. Rounded tannins, but also sharper then year 2000. Full body and good length. The closed feeling gives sign of another 10-15 years is possible. 4,2."
2293,1245309,"This one will always be a memorable favourite. If not for the quality, simply for the histories."
2294,1245309,Drank 96 in 2021 and it was a delightful easy to drink mid-light bodied wine with light earth and soft cranberry notes. May have lost some character over the years but very nice experience.
2295,1245309,"Weird and wonderful wine from Colares, the only wine region in Europe with vines that weren't hit by phylloxera. Tastes like a slim and mature claret. Well integrated oak and tannins, still plenty of fruit left after almost twenty years. The absurdly retro front and back labels are an extra bonus. "
2296,1245309,"Nose of cherries, leather, dry tobacco, morken wood, dried herbs and olives.  Palate follows. Good fruit consentration. Pencil shavings and light salty olive-like in the end. Medium to full bodied.   Very good, but at its peak."
2297,1245309,Typical Colares wine. Mature. Nice with food. Tannins still present  
2298,1245309,"Light alcohol, medium body, sour cherries, good with food. "
2299,1245309,"Dried earthy and rustic nose and taste. Leather, dusty soil, dried red fruit, cherry, red currant, dried green olive, and oak. Medium body, acid drops off in the mid palate, and fruit notes don’t last that long. The wine is good, just not has complex as I would like it to be at. "
2300,1245309,"Nice and fruity, no tannins, probably over the top. Red berries. Medium bodied, medium finish."
2301,1245309,Great with charcuterie 
2302,1245309,"Oakey and vanilla , somewhat acidic but still smooth."
2303,1245309,"Dec 2015, surprisingly fresh wine being from 1996. Very good with lamb."
2304,1245309,Over the top......
2305,1245309,"19 years old and still alive 😛 Fine colour with a brown brake. Bouquet of leather, liqurice and little of tar. Taste with tannins, still. "
2306,2495612,"3.8 icon wine from Sogrape. Dark, rich bouquet of ripe plum, black fruits, spices, oaky. Full bodied, powerful, straightforward. Overpriced. "
2307,2495612,Bold and powerful Touriga with note of tobacco and oak.
2308,2495612,Beautiful nodes of cherry and oak 
2309,2495612,Great wine! Pairing dinner with older Mondavi and Bordeaux. This one will grow with age. Required some time to open up the flavour.
2310,2495612,Uau ... wow  Follows previous vintages characteristics and being so young (2014) is ready to drink / drinkable and yet prepared for a long cellar time. 
2311,2495612,"Another amazing wine at Jncquoi in Lisbon. Dark fruit, heavy dark chocolate and amazingly treated oak. Stil waaaay to young and needs at least 15+ until ready. The finish was long and wow, talk about potential in this bad boy!! "
2312,2495612,"Legado means legacy and is one of Portugal‘s best and finest wines. There’s great complexity on the nose , with fresh red cherry fruit, smoky plum and stewed boysenberries coupled with cinnamon spice, grated ginger, crushed black pepper, cedar, cigar wrapper and pencil shavings . On the palate it is elegant but powerful with great purity and notable freshness allied to silky and very well- integrated tannins that give the wine a harmonious texture and personality. The finale is extremely lengthy and comp"
2313,2495612,Magnificent red blend from Casa Ferreirinha. A jewell from Douro valley. One of the best wines I' ve ever tasted. World class wine!

2317,2495612,"Fabulous. Balance. Oaky. Elegance. Delicious. These are just some of the qualities of this masterpiece that, in my humble opinion, is part of my 5-star galaxy and the world's. Please, if you consider yourself a wine addict, save some bucks or just don't look at the tag. Buy it. Final mark. Pleasure guaranteed from the first sip to the empty bottle!!"

2323,5971105,"Arinto is a great grape, you can rely on it to add fresh zing to blends & as a stand alone variety it delivers much refreshment.  Pale lemon. Med aroma intensity w. good freshness. Pleasing apple, lemon, lime, grapefruit & creamy melon. Youthful & steely.  Dry. Fresh & yet ripe w. juicy citrus of lemon, grapefruit & lime w. white peach, orange blossom & good balance between ripeness & zestiness.

2325,5971105,"13%, good acidity, tree fruits and citrus, pharmacy herbs, slightly tca, easy and some boring wine. I love arinto variety, but this brand produces too massmarket wines with no charisma."
2326,5971105,"Single blend of local grape.   Peaches up front on the nose, the palate is citrus to start, moving into marmalade notes and finishing with salt and minerality.   More a food wine than number 1. "

2328,5971105,"Bought a half dozen of this wine and this is the last bottle.    A gold-yellow tone with greenish highlights.   It has impressions of sage and tomato leaf on the nose.   Rich fruit flavors heighten its crisp and fragrant palate with notes of late-ripened peach, citrus and white plum.   "
2329,5971105,"Nice Portuguese white, a varietal Arinto. On the nose, lemon and green apple notes. Medium acidity. On palate, citrus, minerals and green apple notes. Short finish."
2330,5971105,"Medium intensity gold colour. Pleasant but discrete nose with aromas of white flowers and white peach. Light and very fresh in the mouth with flavours of citron, green apple and peach. Long finish, good ageing potential."
2331,5971105,"As an unconditional fan of the Arinto grape, which together with encruzada variety, are the most extraordinary Portugueses white grape varieties, I couldn’t resist when I saw it on the shelf, and took it. However, the ending was not the best. Presenting intense notes of apricot, nectarine with subtle aromas of mandarim and green apple, in the mouth however, it is expressionless except for its freshness and acidity, typical of Portugueses whites. "
2332,5971105,Pleasant Arinto for a very cheap price! Cheers!
2333,5971105,"Lemony, fresh, good acid. Muted nose, food friendly palate. Linear but lively."

2336,6844635,"Somewhere between white and orange, this moscatel graúdo or moscatel de Alejandría. It’s medium bodied, lovely peach , lychee and rose, hints of smoke and dampness ,kind of like light natural Gewürztraminer without the funkiness or hay aftertaste nonsense. It’s good….!!!"
2337,6844635,Smoky acid citrus 
2338,6844635,Loved it - it’s unique and might not be for everyone. Smells like a damp Forrest or even rotting wood but the depth in flavors is wonderful.

2345,6844635,Not a great fan of Orange wines but with time in the glass this white develops some nice flavours and aromas.
2346,6844635,"Balanced, textured natural wine. Savory aromas with almond and hazelnuts on the nose which follow through on the palate. Skin contact adds complexity. Medium plus finish. "

2348,6844635,"Pronounced fragrance of peach Medium body, moderate acidity. Amber yellow, probably due to longer maceration process. On the palate notes of grapefruit white pepper, yeast, orange zest and a hint of white flower. "
2349,6844635,"I love orange wines, but this one is just weird-- smells like gunpowder and tastes salty...ocean with white pepper and citric acid...just bizarre. A little better after it's had a chance to breath. The saltiness is unappealing to me."
2350,6844635,"Nice oranje wine, not to be compared to the italian "
2351,3355340,"The first word that comes to mind is “round”. It’s full, fruity, and rich with no sharp edges. Deep red fruit and plum fruitiness. Warm smoky finish. Really enjoyable. "
2352,3355340,"Wow - what a surprise packet this is! Takes a while to open up but when it does there is huge depth and complexity on the palate. Smooth, spicy and bold yet soft with strong tannins.  The blend of Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz, Castelao, and Syrah give this wine a very unique flavour.  "
2353,3355340,"Second time I open a Gran Passo and again it is a pleasure to drink. Along with a linguini bolognesa and a camembert at the end, it was a great meal."

2356,3355340,"Decent wine, quite dry but rich fruity flavours of black currant and plum, hint of spice and oak. It was lovely paired with tomatoey pasta but easily drinkable on its own."

2358,3355340,"Quite decent Portuguese wine. A little bit too alcohol in it but while pairing with food, alcohol is not so touchable.

Caramel, vanilla on the nose with lucious yonce legs for days. Cherry, blackberry, and a bit jammy. Medium chalky tannins with a touch of nutty spice on the finish. Paired with a steak, friendship, and a smokey evening in the Okanagan. Bless."

2390,1189822,"Surprising color, light brown with some spark in it. Nose is probably biggest surprise with pleasuring tones of dry fruits, figs, raisins, prunes, apples and honeyed walnuts. It could remind you some great aguardente with an oriental spices. Then the palate is turning you back to wine world with silky and smooth taste, with finish just opening your fantasies."

2398,2669201,"Excellent VV bought from M&S. This is the third vintage of this wine we’ve had and this is better than last year’s but not quite as good as the 2017. There are cider notes on the nose as well as herbal, saline and honey aromas. The palate is gloriously refreshing with flavours of lime, pear, green apple and celery. This is more than just a pleasant apéritif for drinking in the sun; it has depth and a long finish."

2487,6760878,A little acid
2488,6760878,"Fully mineral, almost metalic, as is usual in Arinto and especially in Bucelas, its home ground. Very citric, but oak provided a balanced oiliness."
2489,6760878,"Got as something to try with an Arinto masterclass (instagram @viannawine 19 Nov 2020) and it was a worthy choice: vegetal suggestion on the nose, shade of honey and nut (3yo), carrying a buttery sense of sweet wood into the palate, with a nice length of clean, pleasing citrus to finish - subtle, balanced, 'complete'; a very well made and enjoyable white, albeit perhaps for the purist not a 'straight' Arinto rendition. (12.5% abv)."
2490,6760878,Very interesting. Mineral and austere but highly structured. 
2491,6760878,"Best expression of oaked Arinto I’ve tried. Gorgeous mix of those citric, herbal hints typical of the grape and really big, buttery notes from the oak aging. On the palate, beautiful minerality with great acidity and this enveloping, creamy, vanilla and buttery profile while keeping a gorgeous elegance. Wowed by this Arinto - 4.3⭐️ with room to grow"
2492,6760878,"This Arinto from Jorge Rosas Santos is a surprise to me. The creamy texture with a very welcoming, long-lasting and elegant acidity are the king here. It's very delicious and seems never get bored with. The salty aftertaste with some subtle bitterness really give the wine true character and very enjoyable. Very impressive. The only thing that I expected more from this wine is the aromatic profile, it's relatively reduced and shy of expression, but it doesn't affect the drinking experiences. Lovely."
2493,6760878,"Acidez média-alta, nota a pão torrado, toranja, fruto seco e citrino maduro. Intense golden yellow , notes of toasted bread, ripe citrus and hazelnuts. "
2494,2063250,Easy drinking. Great price for value. Cheers 🍷 Bold Blend with Tempranillo and Touriga Nacional which is brilliantly dominant.      
2495,2063250,"Aromas of red berries and spices reveal gentle maceration in order to preserve the typical notes of these grape varieties and make the wine ready for consumption after bottling. Typical aromas of Douro grape varieties. Sweet hints of rock rose, flowers, blackberries and spices add to the aromatic complexity. Very smooth on the palate with balanced acidity and fine tannins."
2496,2063250,Another very good Douro red.
2497,2063250,"Dark cherry nose. Raspberry, dark fruit and tight tannins. Dry finish. "
2498,2063250,"Dry, smooth, temperanillo blend. Medium bodied. Unoffensive and approachable."
2499,2063250,..... for snack with sardines ......
2500,2063250,"Dark burgundy colour, bright and clean, it gives out matured fruit, berries and wood in nose. In mouth is long and round, with long flavour and strong tannins. "
2501,2063250,Bom principalmente se estiveres a beira do Tejo
2502,2063250,"Smells like grandpa. ""Papa""? Leather and raisins. Theres a subtle quality about it. Forrest floor an dark fruit. Nuanced and elegant. This quite nice. That's an understatement."
2503,2063250,"Red fruits aroma with some spices aromas.  Aromatic flavors but at the same time and smooth in the mouth. Fine tannis, soft body and good acidity."
2504,2063250,This bottle was served on a boat tour that my dad took in Portugal and he (not a wine guy) loved it so he brought one home. It’s actually pretty charming. All fruit at first the Tempranillo really comes out and it tastes more like going Argentine Tempranillo than what I get from Spain. But after a couple of hours it opened up with some baking spices and way more complexity than I would have imagined. I enjoyed this wine for what it was and that it got a non wine geek excited. Very approachable. 
2505,2063250,Rich deep red full of flavour red berries and quite oaky altogether nice drop of red

2508,2063250,Very good house wine 🍷 great with pizza & steak at Xaboita in Luz 
2509,1463733,"Complex wine, with substantial tannins. Dry fruit and spices mix on the palate, and acidity is slightly higher then supposed to be."
2510,1463733,"deep purple red, aroma of red fruit and hint of leather. medium light body, with  pleasant softly integrated tannins and good balanced acidity. slight petillance and surprising medium finish. this wine  induces a type of pleasurable confusion of the palate that could only be the result of something called red vinho verde ."
2511,1463733,A pleasant enough drink.
2512,1463733,"Spiciness on the nose. Slight prickly sensations in mouth with brambles jam, black cherries. Sharp acids"
2513,1463733,"Look at previous TN of 2015. Same wine after 6 years slightly more advanced and opened, still in good shape, very complex and delicious. "
2514,1463733,"Pretty simple wine. I get raspberry, cherry, flat club soda, violet and earthy.  Notable yeast on the nose. Probably wouldn’t buy by the bottle.  Bond street tasting 2/21/2020"
2515,1463733,For the price point off the charts 
2516,1463733,"Crisp, clean, refreshing. A great summer white. A surprising taste that's light and enjoyable. "
2517,1463733,"Fruity and intense with a well balanced acidity , the best red Vinho Verde that I have tasted."
2518,1463733,"My first red vinho verde from my country!!!!  Color is a very bright violet, teenage color! Nose is very peculiar, fruits are present but dominant is earthy (chestnut could be a good description, i took it from other TN). In the mouth this earth taste comes again together with a fine tannin and good acidity. Very well made, very different. Not my favorite taste though i have to admit that is a good discover for the price :)"
2519,1463733,"Vinho Verde tasting to learn a variety of styles in current trend #7/8  Very unique red from Vinho Verde. I didn’t know red is allowed there but I learned until ‘90 reds were produced more than whites even in the region. 100% Vinhão, the variety 3rd widely planted there, grown biodynamically in sub-region Lima. Foot trodden & fermented in granite tanks. 12.0% abv.  Deep purple ruby. Wild berries, pomegranate, eucalyptus or laurel. Dry, med acidity & tannin, dense & rustic red fruits flavor. Unique. "
2520,1463733,"Super interesting. Malo adds a yoghurty feel on this light red. Like a red Albariño. Smells of forest floor and toast. Tastes like brioche, raspberries, strawberries, and ripe red cherry. "
2521,1463733,A light fruity wine with lots of red berries and also blackberry and dark cherry. Almost no tannins and a small and soft acidity
2522,1463733,"Sauvage is the world that comes to mind when describing this signular and  biodynamically farmed, wild ferment Vinhão. Aromas of smoky plum and earth are rendered more complex by a sort of feral, animal quality that persists on the palate as well. A bold streak of acidity creates a sense of tension to sour cherry notes firmly anchored in damp tilth, preserved game, steeped green tea, and pink peppercorn. This won't be to everyone's taste, but for the adventurous, I say, go for it. 11.0% ABV | Sample "
2523,1463733,Very unusual wine. Light texture but with some subtle complexity. Goes well with bacalao.
2524,2140949,Wonderful. Beautiful dark Ruby colour. Palate of fruit forward with soft tannins and mild acidity. 
2525,2140949,This is a find. Classic Douro! Intense red with initial blast of molasses and black treacle on the nose then black fruit with blackcurrant and pepper notes pedominant on the palate. Heady 14% vol. Highly enjoyable. Borderline 4*.
2526,2140949,"A keeper! Although a fair choice for immediate drink, should one let it rest in bottle for a few years, then I believe it can be a really great wine. "
2527,2140949,"Dark, strong and smooth. A bit fruity, red fruit, vanilla, a little sour but that may change when he gets more air.... but it didn’t and that is a pity."
2528,2140949,"Short-note: Great exuberant nose, very good mouth but lacking a bit of structure. Great great end of mouth, long and equilibrated.  Good pairing for medium intensity dishes. Nose 4,2/5 Mouth 4/5 Color and Tear 4,5/5 End of Mouth 4,4/5"
2529,2140949,Amazing value for money
2530,2140949,"Nose of dark fruit bit chocolate and tobacco, dark opaque Rubi color, young, green tanins, to go along with intense Blackcurrant and harsh  oak, unbalanced but powerful. Wait some months, years... Disappointed now, but expecting great things in the future.."
2531,2140949,"There’s a lot to like about this, but a bit too much to push it down a bit. On the upside, deeeep dark cherry, dried plum, a note of tobacco and earth, a bit of vanilla and a dollop of oak. On the downside, there’s too much competition for flavors. Maybe less oak and vanilla and the other profiles in the lineup could stand out. "
2532,2140949,"2012, still very much Alive with nice acidity and finish, good pairing with a roasted Goat Kid"
2533,2140949,"Fruit and vanilla, smooth and silky :) quite nice Douro Reserva :) cheers Portugal"

Crisp and clean, this has some weight from the Malvasia but finishes clean and bone dry. Simple and easy."
2549,76102,"Very good wine! A bit of oak sensed here, nice snd bold, but smooth finish. Not much acidity. Id definitely buy it again!"
2550,76102,"Happy WWW friends 🥂  Vivino says it has five grape varieties and the label three...Encruzado, Bical and Malvasia Fina, so who do we believe 🤔  Anyway it's a lovely juice I think. I don't drink much Portuguese wine but this has encouraged me 😄  Rightly charismatic as the label states...lime and lemon curd cream tarts, zesty with a touch of rind, pear, peach, a hint of melon and perfumed white flowers.  Crisp, lemony with a touch of tartness on the palate enveloped in a tad of creamy goodness and acidity."
2551,76102,So smooth. Fruity. Pairs well with bbq ribs. 
2552,76102,"Dried Fig, leather, and nutmeg. Finish has a bit of  minerality. Generaly a nice wine. "
2553,7397250,Not made with the peels but it tastes pretty much like an orange wine. Super delicious and dense. 
2554,7397250,Completely different amber wine. Smooth and buttery. Sweet lemon. Good oak. 
2555,7397250,"Lovely orange. Would have loved a bit more acidity, but the flavour was like sitting in a wine bar with old friends in Valby past 22 in the evening "
2556,7397250,Lovely and savoury

2573,6080616,"Could have been served a little bit colder (that was the restaurant ‘s fault, anyway...). Nice aromas of wood and ripe, dark fruit, and some tobacco as well. Good tannins. Must try again with something else other than codfish (maybe  duck or lamb). For those who do not speak Portuguese, “Pai Chão” literally means “Father Ground”, which is strange for a wine (though grapes come from the ground as any other vegetable),but in this language this expression sounds exactly like “paixão” - which means “passion”."
2574,6080616,Good bodied wine. Too bad it does not have a little bit more body.

2591,4460318,"Dark violet color, scent of red berries and hint of leather, present acidity, fresh blackberry and black cherry, undertone of tobacco, body and finish on the lighter side, young but fine grained tannin."
2592,4460318,Bought this at a wine shop in Lisbon on the recommendation of the sales person.  It was a great surprise. Light but round and complex. Great to just drink it with friends but also to have it alongside food. 
2593,4460318,Very good. Long finish.
2594,4460318,"Another good 2014 rEd from the Douro, medium weight, balanced, very discreet Wood presence, medium finish nicely balanced. Well-made red from the Douro"
2595,4460318,"Cloudy dark crimson with thick clear legs. Slightly vegetal nose of dark red fruits and herbals. Dry with high alcohol and acid, and quiet tannins. Very ‘French’ flavours of  red fruit - red currant, dark cherry - and menthol, tobacco and herbs. Light to medium body - a rarity in the ‘Big’ Douro - and medium length. Nice light alternative to so many big reds. "
2596,4460318,Good acidity and very soft tannins 
2597,4460318,"4,25. 2015 is the first vintage made by Dirk Niepoort at Maria Izabel. Judging by the quality, I assume it won’t be the last, and the association of the Niepoorts and Georges Dos Santos (Antic Wine, Lyon) to run this Quinta is already very exciting.  Served blind, everybody guessed a ripe and subtle Pinot Noir supported by gorgeous cherry and raspberry aromas, warming spices (white pepper), floral and discreet oak.  Sorry guys... welcome to the Douro !!  Tasted with Jack Madrid and Chantal Montcher. "
2598,4460318,"Dry, smoky & smooth - delicious  "
2599,4460318,Juicy tobacco on the nose makes the mouth water. Tannins dance around the mouth but are balanced out by dark cherry in this well-structured wine.
2600,4460318,"Blueberry, oak, subtle nose. Big, full mouthfeel, grippy tannin, structured. "
2601,4460318,"Well made Douro wine from Dick Niepoort. Dry, medium body and lighter than most Douro, “only” 13o alcohol. Still early days for this 2016 crop, but almost 4.5 for me. Notes of oak, cocoa, nutmeg, cherry and pomegranate. Paired with roasted pork with chestnut and apple purée."
2602,4460318,Esse caldo português é fenomenal. So rating
2603,4460318,"Fruity, full body, balanced.  Veal, braised red cabbage & bacon."

2605,4460318,"Ruby medium coloured. Fruity on the nose. Medium body, light but with the just amount of acidity. "
2606,7620574,"Bon Bon restaurant wine pairing 5/10 Smoky nose with lots of tobacco, wood. Minerals and lemon 🍋 on the palate. Pairing with seafood not optimal 🦞 "
2607,7620574,"Bon Bon wine pairing 5/?  Dark amber color. Clearly lots of wood.  Honey, apricot, lemons. "
2608,7620574,"Lively aromas of ripe citrus & tropical fruits, notes of minerality with hints of smoke. Flavors of lemon, green apple & asian pear with mineral undertones showing flint & stone minerality. Finish is delicate with toasty notes of oak & vanilla. Refreshing & clean mouthfeel. Dry, medium body & big, zesty acidity is intense but decently balanced. This was fantastic with a seafood platter of amazing fresh shellfish. Blend consists of Malvasia Fina, Gouveio Real, Rabigato, Viosinho. Very good quality, 3.7. 🇵🇹"
2609,7620574,A shame we can’t find these delightful easy drinking wines in the rest of the works. The grape varietals are local but the style is of a lightly oaked Chardonnay. 
2610,7620574,"BonBon (* Michelin) in Algarve. Minerals and lemon nose. Oak and vanilla palate. Pre-food reminiscent of an oaky California chardonnay. Paired quite well with sea bass fish, which counterbalanced the oak. LMJ didn't like, even with food)"
2611,1294904,Incredibly delicate and subtle. Tropical and fresh. Ever so slightly metallic and bitter aftertaste. Toasted nuts. Hardly any colour. Stunning wine. Very close to 5 stars. 
2612,1294904,"White fruits aroma with some floral notes.  Fresh, good acidity and well balanced. Very elegant and a surprise sweety finish. Good wine!"
2613,1294904,Apple ... lime ... tropic ... good acidity ... interesting for me that is categorized as white wine but made of Aragonez grapes (familiar to Tempranillo) ... called invisible as you do not see the typical color (by the way they make it)
2614,1294904,One of our favourites from Portugal & one of the 1 or 2 we would buy again. It was €15 in the Algarve though.

2624,1294904,Very fresh clean and green 
2625,1294904,Great wine for a seafood dinner. Almost invisible in its own way.
2626,1397230,"Nice red blend from Alentejano, Portugal.  This is very first time I tried together Shiraz, Trincadeira and Aragonez. They are well balanced and fairly strong at 14% Alc.  Went incredibly well with pork in curry. I received it from Miguel during my trip to Portugal, so thanx Miguel for this lovely bottle!"
2627,1397230,"Fruity, good body, good intensity. Flavor may have split opinions. Value for money may be questionable."
2628,1397230,Great grocery store red.
2629,1397230,"Simple & unpretentious, just like its white counterpart."
2630,1397230,"Quite simple yet pleasant red, good value for money. Mix of red and dried fruits."
2631,1397230,Ok. I was expecting more.
2632,1397230,Had it with a sirloin steak. Good match. Very decent wine for the price.
2633,1397230,"Light, intensive and slightly jammy (but not sweety;) red and dark fruits, med acidity, light tannins, food friendly, good QPR."
2634,1397230,A good wine for first dishes and sea food
2635,1397230,sweet and smooth!  Alentejo...
2636,1397230,"Super fruity, stank like Australian Zinfandel. Decently balanced for the price - solid choice for a low end fruit bomb."
2637,1397230,a tad less than I expected but good body
2638,1397230,"Tropical fruit, fresh"
2639,1397230,Fruity and smooth on the mouth. Good value for money bottle.
2640,1397230,"Red fruit, fresh and with a hint of oak. Light in style, but with the backbone to be very versatile. Spanish in character, but its own. Good buy!"
2641,1383405,The label and the ratings actually appears better than the actual content of the bottle. 
2642,1383405,"Very smooth and ripe tannins, fresh and aromatic, very elegant, with a  unusual long finish. Berries, hints of rose, spices, violets and fresh notes of basil and bergamot.  18 months in new and used French oak barrels. Touriga Nacional 75 % and field blend from old vines 25%."
2643,1383405,"Fantastic Smell, full body and lots of oak barrel taste. Great on a sunny day"
2644,1383405,"92 Points from Wine Enthusiast, and about $20! This is a field blend of old vines. Would likely age well, but is certainly enjoyable now. "
2645,1383405,"Nose is great: old church wood, cacao, spices. Mouth is even better: smooth soft, velvety, no toung conflicts, elegant. Spicy but nice."
2646,1383405,Tastes heavenly 👌
2647,1383405,Almost no fragrance. Pleasant rounded flavour reminds me of a Pinot noir. Dark blood red colour. Got smoother after being out of the bottle for an hour. 
2648,1383405,"Mild Tobacco, little bit of Vanilla (I guess thats the bit of Tempranillo in it) on nose, deep blackberries and smoky oak doesn't wanna leave the mouth :)"
2649,1383405,Gamey notes with ripe berry
2650,1383405,"dark red color.aromatic, dark fruits, blackberries, oak.tannins well rounded with a long final. One of the good Douro wines. I really like "

2654,1383405,Nice red from our Portuguese tasting. Rich fruit and some spice. A little acidity gave a great accompaniment to our hearty food pairing. Good wine.
2655,1383405,Deep ruby color. Oaky nose and dark red fruit in the mouth. Its powerfull and has dryness and acidity. It gors very well with heavy cheese 🍷🇵🇹
2656,1383405,"Full-bodied red from the Douro Valley. Dark cherry, some jaminess and rounded mouthfeel. The front end a d middle step up and the finish softens. Good food wine with grilled meats, grilled veggies, cured meats and cheeses."
2657,1383405,Lovely light red
2658,1383405,Drink this with sushi @ Barra Este. Good but not my type 😅
2659,1383405,"Very elegant and refined wine. Aroma that harmoniously blends the great concentration of Douro reds. Blackberry, hints of spices, violet, plum, cherry and extremely fresh notes of basil and bergamot. Very smooth and ripe tannins, fresh and aromatic, very elegant, with long finish with oak."

2668,1383405,"Classy old vines blend crafted by another Portuguese star winemaker, Rui Roboredo Madeira. Staged 18 months in oak barrels wIth Touriga Nacional (70%), Touriga Franca (20%), Tinta Roriz (10%) at 14.5% ABV. WE91, RV16.5/20. 4.1*"
2669,1383405,"Another great wine from Douro. Tight nose initially. Flint, graphite, plum, red licorice, caramel and blackberries on the nose. Restrained acidity, soft tannins and a creamy rich body. Some minerality on the front of the palate. Dark chocolate and plum on the finish. "
2670,1383405,Almost no fragrance. Pleasant rounded flavour reminds me of a Pinot noir. Dark blood red colour. Got smoother after being out of the bottle for an hour. 
2671,1383405,Nice red from our Portuguese tasting. Rich fruit and some spice. A little acidity gave a great accompaniment to our hearty food pairing. Good wine.

2685,1383405,Fruity. Good for salmon.
2686,1868301,"Getting more and more surprised with quality from Vinho Verde region. And from this one i like the producer name:)  Pale lemon and bright color, some green hints. Notes of lime and apricot in the nose, nice rock hints. Really dry, nice alcohol sensation with pleasant high acidity finish leaving for a while the citric notes. Drank in a restaurant known for the amazing view of sunset and the fish rices: sitio do forno!"

2689,1868301,Fine fruity drink it cold and on a sunny day! Little sparkly

2691,1868301,"Straw Green color, fresh lemon nose: citrus zest, grapefruit, orange, apple, mouth: mineral, honey, grapefruit, good balance, long finish. Recommend "
2692,1868301,A good value for money considering we are talking about a wine made from the precious Alvarinho grapes. Citric aromas confirmed on the palate where we also realise that acidity and sweetness are very well combined.
2693,1868301,"Fresh clean nose with green apple, lemon zest and something like sea minerals.  clean palate with apple and lemon. High acidity yet balanced nicely, quite long finish."
2694,1868301, green apple peach grapefruit citrus

2697,1868301,"It's not a typical VV, it reminds me more of a spanish albariño. Super high acidity, notes of grapefruit pith, citrus, lush apple, nectarine, salt and some white flowers. I suppose it could even be aged for a year or two to mellow the bitterish finish. we paired it with pesto and it worked nicely, brought up grass-y notes in the wine. "
2698,1868301,"Incredibly very pleasant Alvarinho for this price. Very refreshing with good acidity and lot of fruity aromas combined with very good minerality. Well balanced with decent body and pleasant fruity aftertaste. And all of this for very good price.  🍇 100% Alvarinho  👁 yellow straw in the glass  👃 lot of fruity aromas of grapefruit peach green apple citrus apricot nectarine pear and sometimes aromas of asparagus and chamomile can be achievable  👅 good acidity, medium body, fruity aftertaste   🛒 local shop"

2707,1820051,fruity and intense aromatics. Medium to high intensity. High fruity - freshness but still dry. Lots of light red fruit (strawberries). Some spices give this blend a good dynamic and firm aftertaste. 
2708,1820051,"good wine. juicy ripe red fruit and earthy notes on nose is more interesting than the palate. alcohol feels a little high without the flavours and acidity to offset. 12 months in older french barrels, tannins soft and well integrated. Drink now.  an ok companion with my grilled steak. As a lighter red it would have been better with fish or grilled veggies.  pale ruby. m intensity ripe raspberry red cherry earthy flint wet stones cedar toast.

2709,1820051,"Subtle blackberry-red-berries-flinty nose, unripe plums and fresh red berries on the palate. Delicious misty acidity, integrated gently oaky tannins, hint of wet limestone. Lifted end. Interesting fact that Vivino takes it as an Alentejo Red, following the location of the producer, however the grape is coming from the Lisbon area, as noted on the label.  "
2710,1820051,A medium and dry body with notes of unripe plum and blackberries. Medium tannins that sticks in the aftertaste.

2716,3705139,Beautifully crisp and perfect for the approaching meal which is 100% fish! So refreshing I could lay out in the shade on a warm afternoon .

2729,3705139,Very good and dry with an excellent and elegant flavour. 
2730,3705139,I find this wine very nice one fruity enough not too dry. After drinking in a restaurant bought a few bottles to meet this pleasure once again in some time  😊
2731,1199441,"Still alive, which is amazing concidering this is a half bottle colheita, bottled in 2006, stored in an old mans kitchen. However, its not gonna live much longer.  The alcohol is dominant. Finish is long, with dark chocolaty notes. Ok wine,  would be fun to taste a full bottle also."
2732,1199441,Figs. Very sweet. Too sweet.
2733,1199441,"I was served this in the sky, after an unexpected seat update. I fear this does not make me unbiased in terms of flavour."
2734,1199441, raisin raisin chocolate honey maple syrup red cherry
2735,1199441,"Bonus Round, Part 2, at Basque Kitchen. This followed the 1977 vintage and from an impressive double magnum of something (Harry and we lost track in all the excitement)  Felt more of an alcohol burn on this 1990 than the 1977, but we are really being picky now. Solid 4.5*. Palate providing generous notes of raisin, fig, honey and cooked plum. 1977 more youthful actually. "
2736,1199441,"This tawny port is aged for 7 years from  the year 2005 - limited release and aged in  old casks. Figs, maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla flavour with some tickling alcohol at first which will fade with further aging. @Wijnvoordeel."
2737,1199441,"Raisins, cinnamon, vanilla, slight orange peel taste. Absolutely lovely."
2738,1199441,Caramel to your nose. A bit sharp with taste of dried fruit and fig. Beautiful tears. Long finish with layer after layer of something new.
2739,1199441,"White Colheita. Dark amber in colour. Roasted hazels, overripe stone fruits, almonds, nougat and dates in aroma af flavour. Good 'cake wine' (not dark chocolate)."
2740,1199441,"Stunning white Colheita (rare single vintage with less maceration) from a relatively little known brand. More than 30 years old and wiser and more complex for it. Beautiful caramel colour. Notes of fig, caramel, chocolate, coffee, raisin, Christmas pudding, Brazil nut, honey and apricot. Long length."
2741,1199441,"Happy ending at the new Basque Kitchen.  The last time I had this was back in March 2020. This time I had it side by side with the older sibling , a 1977.  Needless to say , the 1977 won hands down. But the 1990 was still a winner in my book. "
2742,1199441,"Great Porto. Earthy, rich, raisins. Not too sweet!"
2743,1199441,complex  and very elegant wine. i expect more profoundity.
2744,1199441,Perfect balanced drinkable..

2747,1184243,"Good acidity, still fruity"
2748,1184243,"2 hour decant. Just starting to brick - significant acid and tannins, but, sadly, not quite the depth of fruit to back it up - I think this has past its best."
2749,1184243,"Great wine! Completely changed after 30 minutes, so let it breathe... Full, round, smooth, classic Douro blend."
2750,1184243,"Wonderful ruby color. It is quite unbelievable, but I have felt in the nose some racino, berries and peach compote. Very good ending, acidity and typical Douro taste on the palate"

2762,1713662,Fresh smooth wine which fits good to fish
2763,1713662,"A bit of an odd vinho verde - surprisingly medium bodied, low sweetness and high acidity as expected. Mineraly flavors - a bit of chalk or concrete, along with a pretty strong oak profile as well. Still some fruit in there - green apple and citrus. Not my favorite vinho verde but still quite pleasant"
2764,1713662,"Easy to drink, some good aromatic fruit, but a bit watery for my taste "
2765,1713662,Fresh and fruity. Citrus. Good balance and good value. Very good to fish.

2774,1438794,"Very excited to drink this red 🇵🇹 Colares for the first time. Colares DOC is a ”endangered” wine region in the suburbs of Lisbon that is rapidly disappearing from the ever expanding sprawl having shrunk from around 2,500 to approximately 25 acres.  The vines also happen to be some of the oldest in Portugal.   👃 Crushed rose petals, a seductive raspberry vanilla and tobacco 👅 Elegant, mushrooms, poppuri, cherries, fine tannins Really nice  I enjoyed it!"

2780,1438794,"Claret style, well balanced, good fruit, touch of smoke."
2781,1438794,"Fascinating, very unusual wine. Very vegetal (celery, cucumber) and feels young - surprisingly for a ten year old wine. Given time this may evolve into something rather exciting, though for now it is light in body, fresh in its primary taste and aroma and a rather effective cleanser of the palate. One to watch"
2782,1438794,At the Wine Society Iberia tasting  Forest floor nose.  Tight cherry jam palette
2783,1438794,Nice wine with good balance.

2839,5031843,"Banging, crushable, delicious juice! Hints of cassis, chilli pepper and green olives, vanilla, marshmallow, red liquorice, and cranberry loaf. Mouthy, but soft, warming tannins, for this higher alcohol (15%), charmer from the Douro! "
2840,5031843,"Licorice and marshmallow upfront on the nose, peppercorns on the tongue that is carried by its tannins."
2841,5031843,Three years in oak gives you some sweetness and oxidative flavours too. Probably too sweet even for me.
2842,5031843,"Bold, not overly dry. Light fruit flavor, velvet texture."
2843,5031843,Outstanding wine! Strong but with personality. 
2844,5031843,"Happy to be home with this beauty 😍 Full, fruity, balanced and after a fabulous platter of Italian deli items, very easy drinking 😉❤️🇵🇹"

Dry, high acidity, high tannins, high alcohol, full body, medium (+) flavors of leather, toast, blackberries, cream, caramel.  Long finish.  Wine is outstanding.

2853,2173769,"This has been on my wish list for a while now, so when I spied a bottle in the gourmet shop of El Corte Ingles, I didn't even try to resist - 3 hours in the decanter - deep purple with a lot of leg - faint blackcurrants in a quite alcoholic nose - it fills the mouth with dark fruits reminding me of the colour violet and a slightly rough edge - long finish - my kind of wine."
2854,2173769,"A gorgeous wine, fills your nose with cask and fruits, a nice smooth wine with balanced tannins and deep oak and fruity notes, "
2855,2173769,"Wine dinner at the Yeatman Oporto: 100% Tinto Roriz (Tempranillo). Paired with Pigeon. Nose of cherry with some funk, barnyard. Mature cherry and red berries in mouth. Still good acidity."
2856,2173769,"Cherry and spice nose. Nice structure, good fruit, lovely spice. Bright acidity, nice fruit. Fresh and very Approachable."
2857,2173769,"Spicy. Well-aged. Dried blueberry, jam, sage, bread and cream. Medjool date and dried herbs and cracked pepper. Even though it is red it paired wonderfully with cuttlefish. Who knew. I would drink this again any time. "
2858,2173769,"Quality time with my father enjoying this aged Tinta Roriz from one of my favorite wineries in central Portugal. The cork broke upon opening but I saved it. Nose with sousbois, ripe prune, beautiful oak, smoke and alcohol followed by a tertiary palate that lost quite some (black) fruit already but makes up for that with restrained acidity, very dry tannines, licorice, leather, plum, prune and a still impressive finish. 4.2"
2859,2173769,quite good tinta roriz
2860,2173769,Light with bold but clean flavors. Merci GabCharles

2863,2173769,"Exquisite taste and flavor, lacks body and depth. Great wine nonetheless."
2864,2173769,First try on a Tinta Roriz.  Balanced for the 2005. Nice but doesn’t have a long after taste. Needs more drinking to appreciate.

2869,1255594,"Dark gold 👃 Strong butter and smoke, a bed of banana, citruses, resin, a drop of honey. 👄 it enters subtle and then reveals freshness, high acidity, medium plus length, an ever so slight bitterness. It is very dry and gives back the woody aromas after the sip. "
2870,1255594,Amazing wine! The age of the vineyards is easy to fill on the mouth for a long time. Fruit and fresh QB! Great wine!
2871,1255594,"This wine assembles a unique wine experience from Douro, well balanced, dark red color intense tannins with a enormous concentration of ripe fruit which indulge our palate, vegetal, this grape variety gives this wine something to remember for."
2872,1255594,"This was so good, smooth, vanilla, tabaco, a little roughness in the mouth."
2873,1255594,"It has a shiny citrus color.  The aroma is delicate, with notes of fruits and flowers. In the mouth is structured and creamy, with marked acidity Long and attractive finish."

2878,1255594,great balancw between acidity and minerals. 
2879,1438794,Something that requires food because the tannins can coat your tongue without it but even with a cracker you will find the complexity bursting out! A soft nose and nice middle with some mineral even a tiny hint of salt and a long tannic finish. Medium bodied. Lovely
2880,1438794,"Medium red in color, a bit unclear. Raspberries, cherry and leather on the nose. Cherry, iron, leather and raspberries on the palate. From a 50cl bottle. This is a fresh and youthful wine that opened up straight away. "
2881,1438794,Dry and very complex red wine with notes of blueberries cherry leather pomegranate tobacco and rich with plenty of tanines.

2889,1438794,"A real rarity from Portugal. Interesting wine that shows an overall fruity character, medium bodied with a very savory undertone, plenty if earthy notes and a nice mineral finish. "
2890,1438794,"Very interesting to taste an ungrafted prephiloxera varietal. Not that I have the skill to taste the difference, but a rarity nonetheless.  Ripe red fruit, plum, raisins, spices, balsamic notes, nice acidity considering its age, yet smooth and easy to drink. Medium bodied, nice finish.  "
2891,1438794,"Dry, tannic, acidic wine, but feels lighter than expected. Great value. Loved it. Better when chilled."
2892,1438794,"Cherry and sousbois, resins. Mineral tannic and needs aging. 5 years in mahogany vat and 1 year in used French oak. Sand soil. "
2893,1438794,"Very excited to drink this red 🇵🇹 Colares for the first time. Colares DOC is a ”endangered” wine region in the suburbs of Lisbon that is rapidly disappearing from the ever expanding sprawl having shrunk from around 2,500 to approximately 25 acres.  The vines also happen to be some of the oldest in Portugal.   👃 Crushed rose petals, a seductive raspberry vanilla and tobacco 👅 Elegant, mushrooms, poppuri, cherries, fine tannins Really nice  I enjoyed it!"
2894,1435733,"Lovely fruit, smooth and elegant and a nice third glass during a 3 hour meal :)"

2896,1435733,"Intense ruby color with violet rim reflections. Expressive and elegant notes of ripe black fruit like blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and lovely aromas of violet, eucalyptus and prune mixed with tobacco leaves, cigar box and spices like cedar and licorice. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. Full bodied, balanced, vibrant acidity and long finish."
2897,1435733,"Purple red. Intense aroma of black and violet cherries. Tannins thin and ripe with the spicy touch conferred by the Syrah. With body, balance and a long finish."
2898,1435733,"Beautiful nose ! Vety balanced with good structure. Medium to full bodied. Black berries, prunes, slight vanilla and smokiness. Good long finish. Drinks well alone as well with cheeses and rillette.  One bottle not enough . Decanter an hour."

2910,1253619,"95% Syrah 5%Viognier a la Cote Rotie, in Alentejo, Portugal.  Black fruit with generous amount of pepper, smoked meat and crushed rock. The lift of the viognier gives a pretty fruit focus. Long, wild herb, rich fruit and minerals on the finish.  Very good! "
2911,1253619,"Probably the worse bottle of this usually very good wine si far. Not bad, but its strong points were subdued."
2912,1253619,"Full body, herby, spicy but still very gentle. Top wine. One of my favourites."

2920,1253619,Exemplary Viognier from Alentejano - exotic fruits like mango and pineapple - vanilla lining - medium+ palate - unbelievable this quality can be reached in such a warm climate. @Wakende Haan.
2921,1253619,Delectable wine with subtle black fruit notes peppery finish. A blend of Syrah and Viognier (5%). ❤❤❤
2922,1253619,"I just do love these Syrah-Viognier blends. And this Portuguese one in its age of 8 years is delicious. Powerful from the first till the last drop. Skillful infusion of oak contributes here to the length, depth and multilayer effects of aromas and flavours. Powerfull wine. Still dark ruby colour shining so beautifully. Aromas and flavours of ripe raspberry, blackcurrant, blackberry with so many different nuances like pepper, mint, chocolate, tobacco, flowers. Full-bodied with medium+acidity, strong tannins."
2923,1253619,"4.25... Interesting one, a bit uneven and not ready yet... Dill and cucumber brine then crashed ripe blackcurrant and banana peel... Good potential"

2925,4621696,"Teixuga 2013 Dão.Wonderful white, from the Encruzado grape. A bottle you can find on the wine shop for €35. It has a golden color in the glass, with a thick and slow tear. The nose is absolutely fantastic, with roses prevailing over the slightly present citrins. The mouth reveals a white with Structure, enbodied, with an impressive equilibrium between acidity and sugar.(1,5 years of new oak) More, it reveals clear mineral and resin notes, with a loong end of mouth. Nose 4,6/5 Mouth 4,8/5 Color 5/5 End 4,6/5"
2926,4621696,"WOW!!  Absolutely amazing!! Don’t even know how to describe it 😆 A caramel color. The 👃 very sweet, like port wine, smooth, caramel, honey, vanilla and malt notes.  The body is completely synchronized with the nose, smooth like silk, dry, elegant with low acidity but a present and strong aftertaste. "
2927,4621696,"Very nice wine from Encruzado Old Vines with alcoholic fermentation in barrels and 19 months oak stage. High acidity, integrated aromas, freshness and balanced. High aging potential. Silky texture and complexity. Up to 45 Euros a bottle. Cheers! "
2928,4621696,"Terrific wine, intense and balanced and long finish. It needs some decanting, at first some aroma of acetone but after some time it opens up with honey, apricot, pecan nut and some papaya. In the mouth bit creamy, caramel and some vanilla."
2929,4621696,"Confirming this is a great wine. Had it a couple of months ago in a restaurant on Cascais, just went back and had it again. Wonderful!"
2930,4621696,Probably one of the most interesting white wines I have had in a long time. Great body on the wine and color. Nose was  oak apricot vanilla honey. Taste has  honey almond cream 5-spice powder cinnamon. Just great. Wish I had more

2938,1829667,Nice easy drinking sparkling wine. Honey and straw. Strong bubble. Very agreeable.
2939,1829667,"Fine bubbles, but possibly overwhelming.  A quick tang of green apple sourness, followed by a sweet honey  Leaves a lingering sourness in the back of throat for minutes after enjoying. "
2940,1829667,At enoteca Cartuxa.  Really good as just a glass with nothing.  Nicely aged.  Honey.  Good 7 year-old.  5.25 €/ glass (again huge glass)
2941,1829667,"Very interesting Blanc de Blancs Méthode sparkling from Portugal 🇵🇹  👁 Light gold with delicate to large bubbles 👃  Dried apple, cream, honey and bitter almond. Distinct yeast and warm bread aromas which is not surprising for this 8 year old wine. 👅 Creamy mouthfeel with aromas of yellow apple, cream and perfectly balanced grapefruit acidity. Note: The arinto grapes are fermented “sur lie” for six months. Degorgement is after 5 years of fermentation in the bottle! "
2942,1829667,"Brightly golden with intense yeast notes on the nose, this sparkling Arinto is probably not for everyone but I enjoyed it. Toast, cream and honey notes throughout, big bubbles."

2946,1829667,"Excellent finale of the wnd. My first 'champanoise' from Cartuxa. Monovariatal Touriga National. Copper rose in the glass with concistent, white foam - big bubbles at the beginning converting to endless, fine perleage later. Flowery notes on the nose with subtle red fruit, dried apple, pear keeping the gates. Very dry, savory, acidic on the palate. Excitingly refreshing with a subtle drop of bitterness. Salinity&minerality's the ID on a mouthfeel. V.nice bubbly! 4 points from our sunny terrace today. "
2947,1829667,"Full creamy toasty nose with aroma of apples. Good acidity, maybe a little short on the palate."
2948,1829667,Honey ... citrus ... toast ... little bit of resin ... small bubbles ... Arinto grapes ... from 2012 grapes ... okay but I expected more
2949,1829667,"Golden  colour,  small and tight air pearls, toasted and fermented sent,  great and persistent acidity with the tipical aromas of a nice bubbly... Surprisingly good...   But far from being great, for that it needed some Chardonnay ..."

2953,3979611,"In our friendship celebration, one of my friends prepared a lamb barbecue, recipe of his own. I started the pairing with a white wine. I chose this gorgeous portuguese alvarinho for the task. Limpid clear golden color with yellow reflexes. Nose of green apple, apple and pineapple wrapped in wet grass and freshly cut wood notes. In mouth, showed personality, good body, high acidity, dry and crispy, delivering white pulp fruit flavors with vegetal and woody notes till the end of its lingering finish. Cheers! "
2954,3979611,"Super intense, almost burning (and only 12.5%). Bees wax. Long. Really complex, you just want another sip to investigate further. Nothing heavy, medium body. Quince and green reine claude plums. I wonder how it was a year ago? And how will it evolve? It's the first alvarinho which i would consider keeping for more than a year after harvest... 3 times the price of most premium alvarinhos, but clearly something special"
2955,3979611,"Golden color. Very transparent  wine. Intense and aromatic aroma, In the mouth is full bodied and tasty, with wood notes. long finish. A special Alvarinho wine.."

2960,3979611,Awesome Albariño. Enough oak to bring the acid down. Good structure.

2963,4419823,"With elegant bubbles in the glass, it shows a delicate aroma of green apples, orange peel and a hint of nuttiness( roasted bitter almonds).

2968,4419823,"First Portuguese sparkling for me and I really enjoyed it. The wine certainly is unique. Dried yellow stone fruits, grapefruit, orange peel and bitter almonds. Palate is quite developed with quite some phenolic bitterness but definitely not unpleasant. Excited to try more Portuguese sparkling. "

2976,1519802,"Lovely red fruit, it's got a gorgeous purple colour - Really nice little wine. I think it could age for at least 5 years to really bring out the flavour. Beautiful tannins, slightly acidic, sticks on the pallete for a while. Good value"

3005,2817874,"Delicious chilled not cold, bright yellow gold and medium bodied, dry. Honey and hazelnut with pineapple passion fruit notes. Great QPR and on the roster for Portuguese whites."
3006,2817874,"Melon, apple, citrus zest, and pear nose. High zippy acidity. Baked apple, fresh pear, lime zest, and white peach. Hints of tropical green mango and a little grapefruit. 3.8⭐️ Portugal continues to win me over with their fantastic whites. "
3007,2817874,"Good Vinho Verde,  Alvarinho,  a warm gold color,  Vinhowith bright golden reflexes.  Nose: broken apples, notes of butter, cheese, with honey nuances.  In the mouth: backed apples, brioche, natural acidity, mineral notes.  Wine mineral with alcohol touch  and long finish.  "
3008,2817874,Wonderful mineral and saline notes. Fresh and fruity. Pear and yellow apple 
3009,2817874,"Taste of citrus explodes immediately on the palate. The light, fresh and enjoyable aromas of several fruits invade the nostrils, served chilled with seafood makes the experience unique. Loved it"
3010,2817874,"Fruit, dry, soft in the mouth, consumption very cold!!!"
3011,2817874,Fantastic! Get it if you can!! It is the best alvarinho 👍
3012,2817874,"A very advanced Vinho Verde indeed, an awesome one. Rich and great balance; citrus notes and “warm” fruit like peach in the palate. 4.0-4.25"
3013,2817874,"Alvarinho from de Vinho Verde region, quite good! Cristal clear with a light greenish to yellow color! Aromas of flowers, passionfrute, ripe pineapple , peaches and ripe citrus with a hint of acacia honey. Nice fruity flavours of quinces, ripe pamplemousses and mineral undertones, with an elegant and long acidity. Quite good for the price and being a young wine, I wonder how it will age!"
3014,2817874,Pear and melon. Crisp and lovely
3015,2817874,Very good Alvarinho wine!!!
3016,2817874, citrus tropical peach

3018,2817874,Cave 23 with octopus olive oil powder garlic mousse. Very young
3019,2817874,Good wine with the right balance and a slightly different style from the traditional Alvarinho. Still not a blockbuster and will be interesting to follow in the future
3020,1221244,"Complex on the nose, may cause it is a blend of 4 grapes and 4 month aged in French oak. Good on the palate, with an absorbent and dry effect on the upper mouth. Overall it is a easy to drink red wine."
3021,1221244,"Balanced, long finish, fruit forward, extremely great wine"
3022,1221244,"Dry, almost full body, medium plus acidity, integrated tannins but plenty of those still present, dark fruit, some limestone, balanced oak level, some herbal undertones. Better served warm than cold. Good quality for the price. Will improve further with time."
3023,1221244,It worth it 4.2 indeed. Very good surprise. Didn’t knew this wine and I like it very much. Quality / Price is excellent!  Some spices on the nose. Long and with a very good spike at the on the palate at the very end
3024,1221244,"An amazing red blend from Alentejo. 50% Alicante Boushet,30% Touriga Nacional,20% Syrah grapes aged in French oak for 8 months. Solid & perfumed violet, mushroom, forest floor and spiced blueberry directly reach the nose. A core of black fruits flavors build layers in expressive & structured notes of licorice, violet, sweet tobacco,cocoa hinting of mint & vanilla. Racy acidity & almost full bodied backbone are in full liason to leave an elegant aftertaste that lingers. Paired with roast beef. YP93 2020.4.11"
3025,1221244,I would say this deserves 4. 5 stats.  incredible value for money.  upmost nobleness and intelligence.
3026,1221244, oak dried fruit chocolate pepper
3027,1221244,This is what alentejo is all about 
3028,1221244,"Dark purple color, plum, a little tannin, sour, dry."
3029,1221244,This wine gives the best of Napa a run for their money. It’s excellent. Just ordered another 6 bottles.

3031,1221244,Sweet wine for everybody

3041,1361814,"String! Sweet, but very good. Definitely a 2 drink max, but I like it."
3042,1361814,"I love Dow's since a tasting I went to some years ago. Short of vintage, this is my ""go to"" juice. It gives me the red & black fruits I like with a light alcohol burn and good balance. Yum!"
3043,1361814,"The least sweet port I've had which is a definite plus. Dry fig, caramalised onion with a touch of smoke. Quite smooth with a nice kick at the back."
3044,1361814,Good taste but nothing special
3045,1361814,"Fig, blackberry, and spice on the nose. Delicious complex port. Flavors of fig, blackberries, kirsch, brown sugar, pepper, and anise. Warm finish of fig, kirsch, brown sugar and anise."
3046,1361814,"4.2. Bottled in 2020. Clear, deep ruby. Clean, pronounced intensity aroma of blackberry jam, black, cherry, plum, mint, licorice, cinnamon, vanilla. Sweet, medium tannins, full body and long finish. "
3047,1361814,"4.3 I prefer tawny, but this is an excellent ruby. Caramel, black plumb and black fruit on the palate. Plumb and Dried fruit on the nose. "
3048,1361814,"This is a sweet fortified red wine made from a blend of grapes Tinta Barocca, Tinta Roriz, Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, and all the traditional port varieties grown in Douro, Portugal. Thick texture, but very balanced, with expressive dark red fruit and violate notes and well integrated tannins. "
3049,1361814,"This is a great LBV for the price point.  I must admit that this isn’t my wine style, but that isn’t to say I can’t admire and appreciate a good wine when I see one.  Dates and fig are what jump out at me here.  Cheers! "
3050,5362354,"Nice vinho verde. It’s classified in Vivino as sparkling, but I personally get any bubbles at all. Pale yellow and well balanced sweetness-acidity. On the nose, pineapple, citrus, cheesy and vegetable notes. On palate, lemon and tropical notes. Short finish."

3055,5362354,"Very light in color almost crystalline . This offers fine and delicate aromas of pebbles, fresh ginger, white peach fruit, dried flowers , graphite and even a touch of cucumber . The wood aromas are very discreet , allowing the delicate fruit to stand centre - stage. Fresh, fine and complex on the palate , the wine shows more and more layers in the mouth , with a steady backdrop of elegance . It somehow reminded me a little bit of a Riesling from the Mosel region.  "
3056,5362354,"Avesso, Arinto, Alvarinho, Trajadura. Vinho Regional Minho. Vinho Branco White Wine. Vinho Verde. Very unassuming on the nose. Not to acidic. Super linear, underlying melon flavour. Drank from the freezer and as it came up got really interesting. Melon changing from ice cold water melon to ripe warm Guadeloupe. Strawberry. Flattening our to be a little savory. Super rich."
3057,5362354,smooth easy to drink  not sweet pretty flavorful

In the nose prevails the presence of fruit, blackberries, raspberries, currants, blackcurrants, some vegetable and floral notes. In the mouth maintains the profile, is balanced and shows polished tannins and firm acidity. Elegant and medium aftertaste.  The Quinta de Ventozelo Vintage Port is a red port produced by the Quinta do Vinho Ventozelo."
3064,91115,Superb port 😍

3066,91115,A bit of dried fruit  Vanilla  M sweetness Full body  M+ alcohol Long finish with dried fruit and raisin palate 
3067,91115,Wow. I can’t believe that this is not a Vintage port but an LBV. It is simply delicious. Balance of sweetness with fruit is almost perfect and it’s so soft and delicate. Highly recommend and especially at this price. 😋
3068,91115,Best port of 7 on a tasting tour. Very well balanced ruby — definitely a great year for port 
3069,91115,"Dark red color. In the nose prevails the presence of fruit, blackberries, raspberries, currants, blackcurrants, some vegetable and floral notes. In the mouth maintains the profile, is balanced and shows polished tannins and firm acidity. Elegant and medium aftertaste. "
3070,91115,Quite decent but not memorable. 88 points
3071,91115,"Notas de frutos secos, chocolate, caramelo e cassis, Voa acidez e volume de boca. Final médio +. "
3072,1197287,"Boy oh boy what a magnificent white! Citrusy and tropical fruits, some floral honey notes, velvety and buttery, very elegant, very correct on the acidity, infinitely drinkable. Reminded me of some wonderful Chilean Chardonnays but with a more oily, mineral character. A bomb of a Verde"
3073,1197287,"Deep straw color with green highlights. Green Bell pepper, herbal notes, butter, limes and mineral (calcium). Well balanced, oily sensation, fresh, crisp and long finish with limes, peaches and mineral aftertaste. Great wine!"
3074,1197287,"Splendid Alvarinho from the Vinho Verde region! An emblematic regional classic, that firstly raised the bar for this great whites. This is an aromatic Alvarinho, aged at least 6m in bottle before release. Light, elegantly fruity and complex, with crisp acidity and great length. Greenish yellow color, citrus and tropical fruits aromas/flavors, slightly floral, with notes of fruit compote and herbs. Dry, mineral and fresh, with a persistent lingering finish. Great white, with very good value!"
3075,1197287,Great white from a great country.  Very well structured. Balance of fruit and acid and a depth of flavors.  
3076,1197287,Amazing choice for sipping. Fresh. Tasty. Works perfectly with seafood. 
3077,1197287,"Perfect body, oily and fresh with high acidity. Inwould place this one betwen Rieling and Sauvignon Blanc. Amazing with fish as a pairing! Love at first taste"
3078,1197287,First wine in our holiday in Porto. Very nice traditional restaurant. The wife knocked this back after a few too many cocktails 
3079,1197287,"Light straw colour, smells fruity,tastes of fruit. Light with some zing. Not too acidic either. Definitely wine for a hot afternoon with or without lunch. "
3080,1197287,"Great Alvarinho!  Smooth but with far more flavor than your traditional Version.  This drinks like a Chard, but has all the notes appropriate to accompany Food."
3081,1197287,"This one is the best vinho verde I’ve tasted so far. Less fruity, but a bit smoky and cheezy and so mineral and fresh at the same time!"
3082,1197287,"Citrus, apple, peach, mineral"
3083,1197287,"Very good but just short the best Vinho Verde I have tried. Lemon and even zest in the nose and palate above all; you can find notes of passion fruit if you look very hard. Fresh and crisp, distinctively sour but lacks a twist and complexity. 4.0- "
3084,1197287,Vinho verde at its best. A wonderful citrus mixed with distinct minerals and fresh cut grass provide a flair that carries from the nose to the palate in a truly exhilarating experience. Serve it as cold as possible to enhance all of its potential. 
3085,1197287,A beautiful aroma with a strong straw colour. An amazing wine with a strong peach aroma. Another great Portuguese wine. 
3086,1197287,"Tropical fruits and crispy acidity. Very nice, cleans your palate goes well with tapas and the likes. Love it. "
3087,1595446,"Inky dark ruby red, complex flavors of toasted oak, tobacco, black cherries and dark red fruit. Full body, fine tannins and bright acidity that lingers on the finish. "
3088,1595446,"Very fruity, hint of pepper reminds me of some Shiraz wines - lovely buy to help me through the lock down in Luanda this month....."
3089,1595446,"Dry, rubber, warm raspberry chocolate, love this Portuguese red. "
3090,1595446,Cannot say enough about this smooth balanced beauty. I'll buy again & again. Visited Portugal last fall & did not taste anything on the Douro this well blended. Deep berries & just enough oak. Not overwhelming at all.
3091,1595446,"Earthy, red fruit, smooth— good table wine"
3092,1595446,"Classcal douro wine. Dence, full body, lots of red fruits in mouth."
3093,1595446,"Nothing special. A bit to watery, dry. Overall quite nice. "
3094,1595446,First night in Madeira. Recommended by the waiter to be paired with steak. Peppery flavours and medium bodied dark red. 
3095,1595446,Robust and fruity 
3096,1595446,Excellent wine and on a brief (3 day) visit to this part of Portugal the choice of local wines was bewildering. It helped a lot when the waiter pointed out we could actually see the winery from our table!  This is a very pleasant fruity wine with great nose and legs. A steal at 20€
3097,1595446,Ruby wine with a touch of sweetness...fig? Vanilla?
3098,1595446,Fantastic to the Ribeye 
3099,1595446,"Red fruit, spice, tobacco "
3100,1595446,"Dry, smooth, easy drinking"
3101,1595446,Bull bodied red fruit and oaky
3102,1361931,Fruity oily full & rich but not too much. Very suprising very enjoyable
3103,1361931,"Fruité et long en bouche, excellent vin "
3104,1361931,"The bottle is soooo heavy, that I wondered what wine deserves this treat ?  Alvarinho Arinto e Antão Vaz, from Alentejo, clear and clean, a bit yellow straw colour, mineral armas with some stone fruit, more peach than apricot and a bit of quince, still fresh... Flavours of medium minus intensity, minerality and the somehow tiered freshness of citric fruits...  Well a normal bottle would have done it, for this wine you don't need an 1kg glass bottle, what a waist for an ok wine... Actually the Alvarinho..."
3105,1361931,"Maybe not the best pairing, the food was initially overpowering it. After setting it aside a while the quality was undeniable. Oily nose with lemon, stone fruit and pineapple followed by a wonderfully complex palate with perfect acidity and beautifully infused wood. 3.9"
3106,1361931,"Very nice. Soft, elegant. Some honey. Ideal balance. Some oak, little pepper."
3107,1361931,Very distinctive ripe cherries and sweet spices flavours. Full bodied with Impressive long finish. Quite earthy though only 25% new oak barrel.
3108,1361931,"Some reductive (in a positive way) notes,  oak, almonds and dried fruit notes.  Complex and full-bodied, with a long finish."
3109,1361931,"Fine wines for the barbie#3: Expectation was high but it was a bit disappointing,.. all the ingredients were there to spoil the nose and the tasting buds but the intensity was so weak...a pity."
3110,1361931,Balanced and full body
3111,1361931,Great wine. Balanced flavours.
3112,1361931,"Apricots, peach, passion fruit. Concentrated. A good wine, but way overpriced"
3113,1361931,Solid and uncomplicated Alentejo. Full of ripe red fruit. Moderate tannins and just right amount of acidity. Not much oak. 
3114,1361931,Wooden flavor. Persistent taste with some body for a white wine
3115,1361931,"Fruit, dry and excellent price!"
3116,2008094,"Welcome to Portugal, again 🇵🇹 I just love it when you walk into small restaurant with only local food and they offer four star wines at very reasonable prices. That was the case last night aged that's how I met this lovely Nunes Barata Reserva. Usual Alentejo mix of local grapes resulted in 15% Alc and mouth full of flavours. There are berries, leather, full body and long finish. Great start of this visit"
3117,2008094,"Dark red wine. On the nose dark fruits and some wood. Taste of prums, blackberry, vanilla and some oak. Very nice. "
3118,2008094,Belo rose do Alentejo...
3119,2008094,"Intense, black ripe fruit, long finish, very good alentejo. "
3120,2008094,"Frutado, encorpado, seco..."
3121,2008094,"Very, very good wine!"
3122,2008094,"Interesting blend of Shiraz, Alicante bouschet, touriga nacional and trincadeira from alentejo in Portugal but falls a bit flat. Medium to full bodied, blackberries, cherries, vanilla, touch of chocolate and savouriness but not too keen on such a dry and oaky wine. It’s better than decent, anyway, of course. Likey...."
3123,2008094,Yummy. Mom birthday dinner Lisbon at La Papaarrucha
3124,2008094,Frutado e encorpado
3125,2008094,"Excellent balanced wine, oak and dark fruit notes. Great value "
3126,2008094,Médium to full body. Slightly fruity. 
3127,2008094,"International and commercial fruit bomb, cooked forrest fruits and blueberry jam mixed with cinnamon and black pepper. Firm still very astringent tannin structure with a medium long finish. Decent wine very curious what some more aging will do."
3128,2008094,"Powerfull, full of flavor"
3129,2008094,A ripe nose. Red fruit blackberry and a tone of raisins. Nice complexity and an smooth finish. 
3130,2008094,"We had this wine in Evora. Really enhanced our meal. 20 Euros at the restaurant. Nice depth. Chocolate, some cherry and cedar. Medium finish. "
3131,6217102,"Such a fabulous wine! I need to get some of those to take home! The sommelier was nice enough to tell us the story of the family. A Spaniard who came to Douro region and had 4 daughter and the wife named Maria. He passed away and the daughters went on with the business.  Aroma and flavors full of plum, delicious jam like you are opening a homemade dark berry jelly full with honey and caramel. Absolutely delicious, very juicy and easy to drink. At the same time as it is a full body with very elegant tannins."
3132,6217102,Elegant wine with a SOUL of its owner of the winery. very well balanced. Medium finish. 
3133,6217102,Had this at the recommendation of the waiter at descorbe Lisbon Belém really enjoyed it 5 regional grapes coming together. Hadn’t been a fan of Portuguese wine previously but this was a changer 
3134,6217102,Amazing wine from 🇵🇹 Full body and deep. High qualitative tannins. Not long aftertaste but still top wine
3135,1855353,"Light nose of very ripe, black plums and dark chocolate. Plum and some raspberry and blackberry notes upfront.   Dark cocoa powder, hints of pipe tobacco with well integrated, medium tannins to the midpalate.  The cellaring seems to have smoothed the acidity that I remember from the first bottle. Medium long finish. 14% (4.2 stars)"
3136,1855353,Perfect with cod and red wine sauce.
3137,1855353,"In my nose it is wonderful! Woody at beginning, very charming after half hour"

3141,1855353,"Drunk again Dec 2017 This Douro-wine was fermented in traditional granite ‘lagares’. First brown coloring. Powerful and complex arroma’s . Hints of oak, raisins and even Port (elegant sweetness). Longer finish with a lovely fraicheur. For me not still on its top !"
3142,1855353,Very strong and complex.  Interesting balance. Some fruits in aroma.  Little bitter.  In some points still sharp.  It is good to leave it for 3 or more years.
3143,1855353,"A very pleasant juicy and refreshing, yet powerful portugese. A lot of berries, vanilla, chocolate, leather, strong menthol, some herbs. Med+ body, catchy tannins, nice acidity, long lasting aftertaste. Can easily be stored for another 5 years."
3144,1855353,"Heavy, full-bodied red with dried cherry aroma, smoke, good complexity and very harmonic and rounded. Velvety texture. Long finish. Can't stop enjoying it! Good value. "

3149,1855353,"Rich, fruit, plums and berries. Some vanilla  Long finish "

3154,1424778,"Bold, fruity red with raspberry, blackberry"

3156,1424778,"Very dark and profund colour. Red fruits and matured fruit on the nose with hints of toast. Well balanced and elegant with medium persistency, with a full body."
3157,1424778,"Fantastic wine. Made about 50km further inland from Qta. de la Rosa's base in Pinhão in the very hot Douro Superior. Mainly Touriga Nacional & Touriga Franca. Deep ruby with stewed black fruit (blackberry, damson) & vanilla-infused spiced oak from 18m in French barrels. Med.+ intensity. Dry, med.+ acidity with fresh blackcurrant, blackberry, black cherry & black plum. Rich & velvety med. tannins. Juicy red fruit (cherry, loganberry). High alcohol & a long finish. I'll be seeking this out back home. Complex."

Palate as a dark winter evening with Iots of intense dark fruit. Black cherries, black currant, plum, oak, liquorice and spicy notes. Medium bodied, med acidity with tannins still present... let him rest for a couple of years. Medium, solid finish with hints of mint. My score... for the price a well deserved 3,8*"
3162,1424778,"Yum! Deep purple in color. Dark fruit, plums, peppery, cedar, sweet-ish cigars. Quite some tannins, nice to pair with juicy meats. "
3163,1424778,After time to breathe and reach a warmer temperature from cooler this proved a pleasant wine to accompany black pork. Fruity with some sweetness and low acidity. Good aftertaste. I look forward to the 5 bottles sitting in the cooler.
3164,1424778,"Wildflower, tart cherry and plum. Pretty spectacular table wine."
3165,1163127,"Tried at a tasting & remembered it as better than it was when we opened it. Sadly I can't remember too much about it now except that it was fruitier and stronger than I prefer. Maybe just a bit ""much."" Maybe it needed more aging; maybe it needed decanting. 13.5% alcohol; imported by Aidil Wines and Liquors, Newark. $17.99 from The Wine Merchant. I think there are better wines available for this price point and lower."
3166,1163127,What a funny nose. Soy sauce and sweet spices. Yummo. 
3167,1163127,A bit Port like but good wine
3168,1163127,It was recommendation by the owner of Delicias De Portugal Warwick Way in London and would say superb. Fruity and smooth.Alc 14% but don't feel too much.
3169,1163127,"Another great portuguese Douro wine, made from 5 grapes blend, unoaked. Foggy red color with violet reflexes. Fruity foward nose with mature blackberry & plum, red fruit jam wrapped in toasted & violet notes. In mouth, well structured, soft, silky, balanced & rounded up, average body well integrated with its acidity, delivering delicious red & black fruit flavors honoring nose. Long lasting gifting remarkable fruity & toast aftertaste. Great CBR. Paired wonderfully with codfish, “portuguese style”. Cheers!"
3170,1163127,"Great blend from Portugal. Oak, cherry, vanilla, little smoke. In mouth a little sweet in the end, good acidity and smooth tannins . Worth a replay. "
3171,1163127,"Dark and intense, perfect paring with manchego cheese and red meet, fresh bread and olive oil!  dark fruit earthy blackberry plum"
3172,1163127,"So so smooth. Just like a Latin man. Suave. Smoke, tobacco, long finish. Black fruits that just complement the lamb dinner perfectly.  "

3174,1163127,"Price, quality this wine is amazing, loved it"
3175,1163127,"Violet colour, fruity, blackcurrant strawberry, plum, medium to full body. Once it airs out it’s very good, quite bold, slight pepper and leather in the aftertaste. Very nice "
3176,1163127,"Damson and violet nose. Body is juicy and full with plum, blueberry, lavender and a gentle dark fruit finish. Given it was from a Fortnum and Mason hamper I’m surprised by the sub £7 average price but then that’s not a cheap bottle in Portugal! "
3177,1163127,"Excellent wine produced by Quinta das Tecedeiras at Douro valley in Portugal. It’s a blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Tinta Barroca, Touriga Franca and Tinta Amarela.  It has a intense ruby color and aromas of earthy and black fruit.  In the mouth it presents smooth tannins and taste of  black fruit and notes of vanilla.  My real rate is is 4.2."
3178,1163127,"Portuguese wine tasting@weingenuss. 3.8. I go with the Vivino average. Non-oak red blend with mainly Touriga franca. Black fruit, raspberry (kernels), fresh asphalt, wild   herbs, red plum, thyme, sage."
3179,1163127,"3.8⭐️ Portuguese blend of six local varieties from Douro. Had the 2016 vintage and would recommend!  Berry-like purplish-red. V fruity nose - blackberry, blueberry and ripe, jammy plum with a slightly floral undercurrent (maybe lavender...). Full bodied with round, juicy tannins, med acidity and pleasant but distinctive minerality. Getting vanilla and some smokiness on the palate with quite a long-lasting finish. Good to pair with meat-heavy dishes.  "
3180,1295490,Got better with time with some time. Nice Douro 
3181,1295490,"Nice, fruity. Little mineral. At  5-6 degree is is very good."
3182,1295490,"Balanced, round, some complexity... a couple of more years in the bottle and an excellent price point "
3183,1295490,"A little rude, old style Douro. Heavy, good with food, but a medium finish. "
3184,1295490,"Dark bright purple hue. Pure, floral and ripe nose showing a wealth of dark fruit, cassis, blackberry, sweet spices and some meaty notes. The palate is dense and concentrated with fine proportions, polished tannin, a fresh acidity, floral dark fruit, ginger and clove notes, with a very long and dense finish, packed with sweet fruit."
3185,1295490,"Quick notes from vineyard visit and tasting in Q de S.José.  Nice! but still young!  Red, thin bluish rim. Full body, plenty of acidity, nice tannins. Blue- and blackberries, plums, coffee and licorice. Long dry finish.  (4,0⭐️)   🍇 Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca from old vineyards. 12 months in French oak barrels.  Alc: 14 %"
3186,1295490,Lovely wine - purple hue with rubber and earth tones; taste of licorice and blueberries; nice acidity and fruit forward. Good tannins and taste lingers long. Needs time to open and is still tight as it’s young. Great value. 91 points.
3187,1295490,"Amazing blend from Douro, dark fruit on the nose with a very good balance, long and lingering finish!!"
3188,1295490,Douro still young but berry flavour 
3189,1295490,"Part of the new trend of high quality Portuguese wines hitting North American shores, we’re finally learning this small country is so much more than Port. Hailing from the Douro, same as Port, and using Touriga Nacional (a native grape with huge potential) and Touriga Franca. Very deep purple in colour, aromatics and flavours of cassis, black plum, graphite, oak char, with some leather and vanilla. Big ripe tannins. Can hold for a few years. Give these wines a try if you’re a California Cab Sauv fan."
3190,1295490,"Lack of richness and texture for a Reserva, could have more length and freshness "
3191,1295490,"Great Douro! Great elegance and style! Garnet dark, you can almost see a lair of wood over the liquid. Nose of dark fruit, peppers, violets. Dry, smooth tannins, aftertaste of a light smoky oak, little sweet but discreet and balanced oak old barrels with fruit and peppers. Wow."
3192,1295490,Pretty nice Reserva. See you in few years 
3193,1295490,"Flat finish at first, then opens up! "
3194,1295490,Very good Douro!
3195,76145,"Pale-gold colored wine with with tropical fruits aromas, such as passion fruit and pineapple, and slightly floral notes. The palate is balanced with a well integrated acidity and tropical fruit flavours, leading a very pleasant finish."
3196,76145,Ruby colouring; jammy red berry/mild mint (?) notes on the nose; smooth and balanced
3197,76145,"Welcome on board TAP, Air Portugal. I might have lost my senses at 10,000m but this wine behaves in very strange way. It opens up nicely, very similar to Sauvignon Blanc, even tough there is none of it inside. Then just disappears completely and goes very flat and uninspiring."
3198,76145,"Good value,  more nuanced palate then some at this price point."
3199,76145,Nice and crisp white with fruity end note 
3200,76145,This is a little suspect!

3203,76145,"Delicious fragrant, one of the best whites I’ve had. Sweet but no sediment sugars. "
3204,76145,Super nice and smooth. Easy to drink 
3205,76145,"Smoky vanilla & hay, good value"
3206,76145,"Exhoberant floral and mineral aromas. A little bit more shy on the palate, but still capable of joining a good fish with class."
3207,76145,An alcohol note on the nose with an absorbing bitter taste that prolongs on a nice trail.
3208,76145,"I’d put this at a 3.8 if I could. Much better than reviewed. Nice smooth Douro red, great value. Will definitely buy again."
3209,76145,"A pretty fast floral white. Light, clear and so limpid almost looks like water. Acid floral pitch, pinapple and mineral twick. Douro has more to bring though."

3226,2824000,"Blueberries, rosé pepper and fudge on nose, mild tannins, blackberry on palate, earthy finish. I guess the difference from earlier review was caused by decanting"

3311,1948579,"A sad sip and sediment accompanied this bottle. Was very alcoholic tasting and bitter. My host wouldn’t allow us to drink it and removed it from the table before the 2nd sip. Could have just been a bad bottle / batch, but want to honestly review it. "
3312,1948579,"Deep flavors of black cherry and oak and tannins. So drinkable, deliciously thick that lingers on the palate"
3313,7218253,"87/100 This is deeper in color and the aromas suggest that it may have some skin contact. Notes of white grapefruit, salt, dried lemon peel, and a hint of nuttiness. It’s not a Sauvignon Blanc that is too aromatic, it’s more of a wine with texture. I don’t know if this wine has aged prematurely or it is macerated, but nonetheless I really enjoy it. "
3314,7218253,"@ Há Prova em Oeiras 2019 (10-12/05) - summery sample #6/7: a new one - this the 2018 I understand the first year produced of this mono-varietal - ozoney nose, scented grass, funky tropical fruit - definitely a Sauvignon Blanc - could be a touch drier for me personally but a good example nonetheless, refreshing, enough acidity.

3323,1397176,"4.2 90p. Nice and fruit driven nose with slighly dusty ripe dark  cheries and a hint of liquorize and well integrated oak.

3340,1597379,Fantastic. THE Douro
3341,1597379,"Touriga Nacional has a character that's all its own: Touriga Nacional definitely has the advantage of being easy to pronounce for non-Portuguese speakers. It is also the nearest thing that Portuguese winemakers have as a signature grape. Our example comes from Douro wine region and it is produced by Carlos Agrellos. Wine in a glass has deep color. It greets you in the nose with notes of blue and black fruits and mint aromas. In the mouth bold and lush, with medium plus acidity and medium tannins structure.."

3375,1577300,"Portugese wines are different, maybe the tanines, but what I know is the older they are the better they become. We are in mid june 2015, opening a 1999 bottle that rested more than 12 years in the same place, position and temperature. I opened and waited only 30 minutes to taste it. it is wonderful.

3413,5136865,Good value and taste
3414,5136865,"In the nose is aromatic, sweet kind of peaches and a light yellow-green in the glass. In the mouth is fruity but is shortly covered by noticeable acidity ending up on a bitter end. Not my cup of tea I would say however is refreshing and would go great with chicken, salads or cheese."
3415,5136865,"Amazing wine for the price, it's very light and made an excellent combination with a soft cheese plate."

Dry, medium+ acidity (that's good for this region and this style), medium+ body, medium alcohol, medium- tannins, medium flavors of lemon peel, flowers, hay, dried herbs, nutmeg.

3418,5136865,"Fresh, crisp, peach and lime."
3419,75651,"Red and white grapes in the same brew - I had no idea what to expect, but how could I resist? 10 hours in the decanter - good call - it wasn't at all nice at cork pop. This is like a classic big Bairrada wine, with a very subtle side-order of high-class apricot conserve - reasonable, but not overwhelming finish. By the end of the evening I'll know if I like it, but, so far so good. In the end I decided I didn't really like it."
3420,75651,"Ripe red fruit, herbs and spices, with a touch of chocolate and a hint of mushrooms and undergrowth. At the same time fresh, fruity and packing a punch.  Meat wine."

3427,75651,"An intriguing blend of Touriga National and whitebical, intense nose, lots of texture and lively fruit, very fragrant and unique with hints of roasted nuts and spice. Perfect for braised or grilled meats."
3428,75651,Second wine from this winery. Not as dear as the 1    Spruce nose.  vanilla plum blackberry oak ash. Nice sweet finish with creamy tannins. 4. 
3429,75651,Excellent wine. Surprised to hear it was a blend of red and white wine grapes - a lot of Australian vineyards do something similar with Viognier. 
3430,75651,Rough and tender at #tapasnascostas
3431,75651,"Ripe red fruit, kirsch, vanilla, peppery spices and menthol aromas. Ripe medium(+) tannins, high alcohol, medium acidity, medium body, rather short finish."

3433,75651,"Red wine grapes mixed with a white wine grape (Bical) but tastes like a dry red wine (i.e. similar to a Rioja) with structured tannins, great QPR."
3434,1287360,"Very good, medium bodied, red fruits on the nose."
3435,1287360,Portugal has so many good wines in recent years. 
3436,1287360,"Ancient catch up notes for personal reference. Superior to the brown label Lapa, this Touriga Nacional, Tinta Barocca, Aragonez VR Alentejano is very good quality & value again.  Med ruby. Pronounced aroma intensity w. concentrated black cherry, blackberry & lifted floral notes of lavender & violet. Leather, tobacco & coffee bean. Vanilla & sweet oak spice. Developing.  Dry. Rich blackberry, black cherry & polished leather. Mocha, sweet spice, velvety med tannins, fresh m+ acid & high alc w. a long finish."
3437,1287360,"Rich dark brambly berries, black cherry, spice, chalk and salt...rich but not at all cloying.  Fruit carries heavy tannin and 14.5% very well.  Med++ length.   Not subtle, but plenty there.  17.5/20"
3438,1287360,Portugal makes some of myvfavorite underrated and high  QPR wines.  This beautiful winery shapes masterpieces from harsh soils 400m above sea level where this magical Portugues blend was born. Salty vanilla blackberry with an earthy smoky undertone combines to make a very enjoyable balanced wine. 2011 drinking ten years later in 2021 - showing remarkable acidity and a silky smooth creamy cerice black cherry mouthfeel. 
3439,1287360,"From rocky, granite hillsides at 400 meters above sea level. Unfiltered. Deep garnet color. Inviting and complex nose with dark chocolate, dark berries and creamy oak. On the palate dark fruit framed in oak, salty notes, licorice and a dash of vanilla toward the finish. Powerful and full-bodied with the right amount of lively acidity and firm tannins. Persistent finish with butterscotch and just a bit of fruit."
3440,1287360,"Easy drinking dinner wine. Leather and black cherry and pepper. Great deal too. Regular $52, on for $22. "
3441,1287360,"“time is magic!” favorite quote from the night... vanilla notes, a little oaky, some plum. med-hi tannins."

3444,1287360,Wine with a strong character. Cherry notes.
3445,1287360,"Cow-hide, spice and chorizo on the nose with a mouthful of cocoa and espresso. "
3446,1287360,"Elegant in it's aromas and taste, this is not your classical alentejo. With a vinyard at 400m altitude, the conditions for the grapes are different, its not a sweeet wine like most wine from alentejo. It is a blend made with the utmost care and precision. Hints of spices and gunpowder, with some delicious red berries."
3447,1287360,"Interesting evening in an empty wine bar in Alfama, I had the owner to myself and as a result a lot of wine discussions.  Nose with clove, ripe prune, black cherry, black pepper and licorice followed by a palate with quite pronounced, slightly hard acidity, OK tannins, black cherry and heartwarming from the alcohol maybe but that was probably emphasized by the couple of degrees of too high temperature. 3.5"
3448,1287360,"Dark ruby color , concentrated. Aromatic very intense, with lots of red fruit and floral notes , spices, balsamic and an interesting freshness. In the mouth, creamy and soft tannins. Sweet tooth feeling with ripe fruit, cocoa and chocolate mixed with some earthy and fresh nuts . Nice long finish ."
3449,1755976,"Special with herbal taste, very aromatic"
3450,1755976,"Well the salmon was cooked to perfection, and to go along with it I wished I had a Chablis, the Chablis was gone for long time, so this wine from Beira Interior in Northern Portugal had to do it... And it did, some elegant reduction some crisp minerality, some greenish oak and ripe stone fruit..  In the mouth some stone, butter and ripe bitter orange... At 5€ I forgot about the Chablis we wished for... Hell yeah the french are overpriced..."
3451,1755976,"enjoyable and fresh, although could be a little rounder in the mouth, maybe with a little more time. I had it with fish but think it would work better with seafood."
3452,1755976,"Acidic, light, easy. "
3453,1755976,"Attractively aromatic on the nose, begins with white and yellow flowers, melon, quince, pineapple. After some aeration delicate nutty and white almond whiffs swap in. The most of above is confirmed on the fruity palate with tart but balanced acidity, dainty minerality and touch of carbonation. Long finish indeed.  "
3454,1755976,A very mineral and fresh white wine from Portuguese Beira Interior Region.
3455,1755976,Lemon and crisp with hints of pineapple and melon. Enjoyable. Saúde!
3456,1755976,Very good wine from one of the best producers from inland Portugal. Fruity but elegant with gentle tanins. It has matured beautifully and it is now ripe to drink.
3457,1755976,"Quite light initially but gets bolder in the glass. Stone fruit, some honey. Good with grilled chicken and harmonises with soy sauce but not too appealing on its own."
3458,1755976,"Citrine color with greenish tinges.  Fruity and tropical aroma.  The aromas are confirmed in the mouth, with intensity and good acidity. Short aftertaste."

3463,1755976,"Fresh peaches, some pomelo, yellow pears, some chalk and white almonds."
3464,7201024,"Another thick beautiful slow wine😋 again molasses, new leather, rub, dried berries😍"
3465,7201024,"At the glass, the color reveals an intense dark ruby red.  Long legs suggest richness of what is about to come. The nose is rich, revealing jammed dark red fruits. Plums, black currant, even a hint of black cherry are noticeable. The wood of a typical “Portuguese Reserva” takes possession of your olfactory senses.  Spices, cinnamon and cloves with a hint of caramel. In the mouth, the 14.5% alcohol comes strong, and connects to a long lasting finishing. Acidity is perfectly balanced."
3466,1444637,"String tanins, very bold, some oak on the nose. I wish I could rate it higher as it was a gift after a stay. I will buy it if I see it to get a confirmation"
3467,1444637,2009 was a great year for Portuguese Wines. This is one of the exemples of cheap and great wine to pair in a dinner with good friends. Also Excellent when paired with brie.

3472,1444637,Very good red. Full body with balanced acidity. Blackberry and oak aromas
3473,1444637,Somewhat like a NZ pinot gris... So I liked it  but some don't.  More for me !
3474,1444637,Pale yellow. Extremelly aromatic with the evident scent of Moscatel. Acidic and flowery. Traces of peaches and tangerine. Lacks some body.
3475,1444637,"Thin non drippy legs. Striking fruity nose. Peppery medium strong tannins. Deep purple. Rich, peppery very dark fruits. Very good. Solid 3.5."
3476,1444637,"Nice red Douro blend, however personally think over its peak. Blackcurrant, cherry, plum, oak, chocolate, tar, leather. Tannins softened well"

Floral, mineralic nose with raspberry and white pepper followed by a very mellow palate with restrained acidity, raspberry, strawberry and sweet edge. 3.3"
3488,1940544,"Great light color like a Provence Rose, fresh and fruity - strawberry mainly. Ideal for sunset moments in 2020"

3542,3818874,Really not my style-young fruit-but got to hand it to Fitapreta: this is well made. I had fun drinking this and identifying a wide range of smells and tastes (from strawberry jam to burnt sugar). I probably would drink this again. Would be interesting to try this in 3-5 years when the young fruit had receded a bit. 
3543,3818874,"Bottle 1825/2984 here. What a velvety texture! Balance, longueur, aftertaste: this is 4.0 quality and I'm being conservative.  One of the few producers that break the spell of oaking their wine in Portugal and has done it right. All my ❣for this one. 14% alc."

3547,3818874,Really nice light body. But still full of flavors. Some acidity but just enough.  Strawberry cherry red currant herbs vanilla hint of butterscotch 
3548,3818874,Sweet round tasty nice flavor works well with north light 
3549,3818874,Pinot noir style. Lot of red fruit in the nose. I taste ripe cherries.
3550,2324480,"Aromatic fruity nose to white peaches, nectarines and milk toffee. I suppose the wine has seen some oak, but the nuance is very delicate. High acidity. M- body. Salty and mineral tongue to green pear, asparagus and lime zest. A very straight forward and honest wine at a good price. Pair with grilled dourada and greed salad with vinagrete seasoning - and you’ll have a great casual dinner."
3551,2324480,A blend of three local varieties produced a very dry white with a crisp acidity; medium bodied showing. Notes of stone fruits and citrus with floral hints and ripe peaches; it has a high acidity and moderate length
3552,2324480,"Great wine at an excelent price. From a winery in Montargil. Balanced, with fruit notes from alvarinho, excelent acidity and perfect suit for “filetes de peixe galo” :)"
3553,2324480,Too expencive in Alko. Quite acidy but nice with creamy onion soup.
3554,2324480,"Clear light straw colored. 1/3 Alvarinho, 1/3 Verdelho and 1/3 Viosinho from Alentejo, Portugal. Open on the nose. Healthy fruit. Citrus, grapefruit, apple, green herbs, apricot, nectarine, a touch of beeswax and salty minerals. Fresh and elegant on the palate. Good balance. Medium length in a dry finish. Nice work. I recommend this with seafood or just as an aperitif. "
3555,2324480,"Crispy and fresh white wine. Taste of citrus and peach. Not too much taste, a little flat, but that is not necessarily a bad thing."
3556,2324480,Pine on the nose. Lemony with gooseberry sharpness. Dry with a hint of chalky minerality and some herbal notes.
3557,2324480, citrus in the nose. Dry  citrus and Some  orange on the tounge. Medium plus assidity. Great with salmon and vegetables. 
3558,2324480,"Great surprose. A blend of non-Alentejo grapes - Alvarinho, Verdelho e Viosinho- gives the wine an uncommon minerality and freshness."
3559,2324480,"A good nose with floral and citrus tones in accordance with the body which is dry, elegant and perfectly balanced with peach and orange tones. Perfect price to quality ratio. "
3560,2324480,"Crisp and fresh. Almost tastes like a “mix” of a chenin and sauvignon with a nice, easy lingering acidity"
3561,2324480,It was a big surprise while I was in Lisbon. I might easily say that it has perfect price and quality ratio. Always go with a good and tasty white wine.
3562,2324480,"Between 3 and 3,5. Mineral and dry and a good everyday drinking white. Well made and promising"
3563,2324480,Quite a good grape balance and a bargain at the price. Good with fish and seafood. 
3564,2324480,"Peach, green apple pear :) but seriously this is well made very rrfreshing wine. At this price range you will it difficult to beat. Another example why Portugal just might pip  the post when it comes to my favourite wine countries and the Alentejano as my favorite region!"
3565,1214568,"Modern, soft tanins, dark fruit. Lacks a bit of concentration and finish short, but still very nice. €10, grade 16."
3566,1214568,"Red black fruits, a bit of oak, a very good wine."
3567,1214568,"Honestly? A pretty smooth, balanced and easy Touriga. Not that power fruit, but it's there, not all oak, but there. Spices? There, and a mid body that comes pleasant. Little acid tick on end. "
3568,1214568,"Dry, a little rough around the edges but not an unpleasant offering from an airport lounge"
3569,1214568,Enjoyable PT wine
3570,1214568,Mais info no blog
3571,1214568,Super equilibrado e encorpado. 
3572,1214568,"Vinho frutado, facil de beber e descomplicado. Taninos redondinhos. Gostei Fruity wine, easy to drink and uncomplicated. Round tannins. I Liked it. 😘😘💃💃"
3573,1214568,"Nose: cedar, oak, black fruit.  Palate: Plum, cedar, oak, leather.  Structure: 13.5% ABV, bold, dry, grippy tanins, dry, medium acidity. Too jammy for my liking.   Not bad, just not overly good. Something you’d expect to try at a party or event.   3.4/5. "
3574,1214568,"Fruty, fresh, sightly acid. By the behavior of the gás in the glass I think have addition of artificial gas."
3575,1214568,Red wine perfect with a Brazilian Pizza style
3576,1214568,Nice.  Some musk.  Little red berries.
3577,1214568,Excellent wine with red meat
3578,1214568,Rose from Touringa Nacionale is a bit lacking in acidity 
3579,1214568,Good balanced red wine. Should be ideally with steak.
3580,75018,"Ripe Douro blend from '05 from a single vineyard which is caracterized by lots of slate! I love the bouquet: Aromas of lovage, tar, chocolate, incense & dried herbs with a nice earthy touch. On the palate ripe, smooth and balanced with still firm, but well integrated tannins, a great wooden note and a touch of acidity. Also the finish is really good: Quite long finish with flavours of sweet cherries, tobacco leaf & leather in the aftertaste. Really good and ripe: Drink now, don't wait anymore! Give me more!"
3581,75018,The Quinta da Carvalhosa is one of those fantastic producers foccused in top quality.  Only two labels... Ardosino and Campo Ardosa. Small production... tiny in case of Campo Ardosa.  A tipical redblend including all grapes of Douro like Touriga Franca..Touriga Naciona...Tinta Roriz...etc. More than ten! Fantastic violet reflex over dark redcollor. Extreme elegance and deepness... full of aromas...  Fantastic!!!
3582,75018,"Blackberry, coconut scent, subtle coffee and chocolate, full bodied without overweight: 0,3G/l sugar and 5,5g/l acidity. Another fine example of the know how of German master winemakers Philippi (mainly), Meyer-Näkel and Breuer."
3583,75018,"The wine shines in rich purple with glossy reflections. The nose reveals aromas of stewed plums, cherries, cherry jam, hints of mocha, graphite and slightly animalistic flavors. On the palate the wine then shows a complex structure which is harmonious and above all delicious. The finish is accompanied by a spicy game of cherry flavors.."
3584,75018,"Impressive with black currant, Black Berry and raspberry, hints of eucalyptus and lovage. Smooth and rather light bkdies"
3585,75018,"Very impressive full bodied Portuguese wine. Dark fruit, plum and a sweet bitter after taste of dark chocolates. Very yummy. "
3586,75018,"A classic Duorowine with hints of dark plums, cassis and barrel aroma. A powerful wine with great balance and a dry, warm and woody finish. Oaky."
3587,75018,"A little bit pale brownish colour. Very ripe and majured nose, lots of lovage, some raspberries and black currants. Very slim on the palate, light toasted notes, good structure with a medium long finish."
3588,75018,"A blend of TN/TF/Tinta Barroca/Tinta Roriz with 13.5% abv. aged on French oak for 20 months.  Crimson red with garnet rims.  Intense nose kicking off with ripe mulberry, raspberry, blackberry and dark cherry as well as loads of balsamic flavours, soy sauce, leather, turned soil, mushrooms, toasted oak and orange peel paired with lavender, violet, eucalyptus.  On the bone-dry palate less complex with balsamic, sour raspberry, rose hip and cherry joined by a salty minerality, leather and eucalyptus.  [-->]"
3589,75018,"Small production, single vineyard blend of: Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesa, and Tinta Roriz grown on steep slate slopes. Vines are 20-40 years old. Full bodied, med/med+ acid, med+ fine grain tannins, and dry. Black plum, black cherry, prune, lightly floral, vegetal, graphite, earthy, light vanilla, cinnamon, cocoa, and high quality used oak. Really smooth finish. Fruit flavours are fairly mellow overall. Very nice structure, highlighting what the Douro is capable of. Drink now."
3590,75018,"Surprisingly delicate, ready to drink. Fresh berries despite of its 13 years."
3591,75018," Dark red wine with purple and ruby ​​edges. In complex nose with ripe red and black fruits, dark chocolate and licorice.Floral touch, leather and smoked. In the mouth intense, complex and structured. Long and pleasant ending."
3592,75018,"Figs and vanilla , light acidity and a refreshing aftertaste.  I like this as a good summer red!"
3593,75018,What a reserve in my cellar 
3594,75018,"[Meyer-Näkel goes Portugal 2/3] Next step on the ladder... Rich nose with undergrowth, plum, prune and eucalyptus followed by a palate with pronounced acidity, very dry tannines, black tea but also fresh raspberry and mint. Good finish too! 4.0"
3595,2751887,"86/100 This is a rosé from Sangiovese. Wonderful notes of lemon zest, strawberry, mineral. Interesting flavors and high acidity, it’s light and crisp. The uniqueness is fantastic but the finish is a bit short"
3596,2751887,One of the top roses of Portugal very pale french style rose! Peach and green strawberry quite mineral and crisp perfect level of acidity! Buy it if you can.
3597,2751887,Salmon pink color. Peach and strawberry in the nose. Dry and crisp. Lot of acid
3598,2751887,Beautifully crisp and dry but providing complex fruits that are best enjoyed slowly savoured as they develop on the tongue
3599,2751887,Smells like melons. Nice and light. 
3600,2751887,Fabulous salmon pink light fruity wine
3601,2751887,"Great rosé from Setúbal! An exquisite rosé made from the tears of (unpressed grapes of) Sangiovese, probably brought to Portugal by the Romans 2000 years ago.. ;)) Complex and deep, with great acidity and length. Pale salmon color, red fruits and citrus aroma/flavors, with notes of green pepper, orange peel and spices. Medium body, polished tannins and a fresh finish. Juicy stuff, pairs beautifully with ceviche and sushi dishes!"
3602,2751887,"🇵🇹 Interessante rosé da Herdade do Portocarro, cor salmão pálido, aroma frutas vermelhas com notas cítricas, na boca bem estruturado, refrescante, seco, suave com bom equilíbrio entre acidez e doçura termina longo.  🇬🇧  Interesting rosé from Herdade do Portocarro, pale salmon color, aroma of red fruits with citrus notes, in the mouth well structured, refreshing, dry, smooth with a good balance between acidity and sweetness finishes long."
3603,2751887,"That's very good. Its firm, ripe red currant and sour cherry, unripe strawberries, light bitterness and delicate minerality "
3604,2751887,"Red summer fruits, nicely rounded and well balanced. It disappeared too fast. Must try this wine again."
3605,2751887,"A fleshy rosé, offering plenty of spicy notes to the ripe cherry and dried berry flavors, with touches of melon in the mix. Peppery details chime in on the finish."
3606,2751887,"Wild red fruits, floral, red cherry, strawberry. Beguiling, fresh, flavorsome. A distinctive rose."
3607,2751887,Fantastic rose. Not sweet like your average rosé. It’s balanced and goes well with jamon and melon. 
3608,2751887,I like it very much as a Rose it has a lot if character. But the 2014 one was something to remember. The price has gone up a lot ... 
3609,2751887,First Rosé ever to truly please me.
3610,2656988,"4.1 - Nice wine from Portugal, good body and structure, like the balance and the peach and citrus notes at an affordable price. Overall ok, just don’t really like the name 🤷‍♂️"
3611,2656988,"Citric, acidity and floral flavor.  Subtle lemon color 👌🏾  Refreshing strict wine.  Food: fruits, Asian food, Japanese cuisine, Spanish salads (jamón con melón)  Occasions: Business meeting, thematic lunches, brunches, gala receptions.   minerals citrus grapefruit lemon nectarine white peach orange zest straw stone fruit  oak  Enjoy your wine!  @[1|30690345|Rui Pereira] has to rate this wine with 5 ⭐️ coz he had drunk almost all the bottle without me! 🤔"
3612,2656988,"Minerals, peach, lime, very creamy, refreshing, bold body (compared to commonly white) and has a very good structure."
3613,2656988,Nice dry white wine.. great for seafood in singapore.. 
3614,2656988,Fruity clean flavours. Nice wine goes well with seafood. Decent acidity.
3615,2656988,"Rich ripe fruit, bright buttery oak. Delicious."
3616,2656988,Fruit 🍏..😜 Portugal 🇵🇹 
3617,2656988,"Unusually structured white, it offers a refreshing citric / acidic flavour, perhaps elderflower? Definitely herbatic. Worth a trip to discover it"
3618,2656988,"Interesting white from Cheleiros/Manz, Lisbon area. The grape is Jampal. It has orchard flowers, blanched chicory, unripe peach. Not bad at all but 20€ is too much."
3619,2656988,"Fantastic. Fruity and refreshing on the nose, light yellow coloured liquor, expected something very light. Instead, it tastes surprising structured and flavourful. Notes include oak, young peaches.  We had it with chicken pie- fantastic complement. Is not drowned out, and citrus flavours became more prominent. "
3620,2656988,Excellent value. Lovely light flavours. 
3621,2656988,"Cream, vanilla, oak and a bit of acid and citrus."
3622,2656988,Somehow this bottle was better
3623,2656988,Good wine. Like the peach notes.  Too much oak for me. I wonder how this wine is going to be with less oak... it will show all Jampal potencial.
3624,2656988,"Borders around 3.8 for me. Clear yellowish in colour,  it contains hints of grapefruit & guava on the nose, finishing off with a whiff of toasted vanilla.  Palate wise, it landed on a crisp dry green apple & fine lemon rind note. Rather dry and with rounded acidity, it was a pleasant evening starter or wine-down drink. "
3625,1315367,To alcoholic... Without a end. Don't like it. Too expensive for the wine quality.
3626,1315367,"Very good, well balanced aroma of fruits and smooth taste."
3627,1315367,Raspberry jam and sour cherry. Better to have it with steak. Acidic. I don’t know all last wines I got from Portugal are acidic. May be they keep them wrong in hot summer 
3628,1315367,Great Douro wine for the price ;-)
3629,1315367,"Tinta Amarela, unexpected great!"
3630,1315367,Fruity and smooth.

3632,1315367,Very nice and soft
3633,1315367,"Fruity, notes of raspberry. It goes very well with panned codfish."
3634,1315367,Fruity with a fresh finish note. 
3635,1736719,"Too expensive for what you get, I had tried better wines for a third of the price."
3636,1736719,Refreshing And Tart.  A Good Choice With Seafood.
3637,1736719,Exactly the taste I like
3638,1736719,"An interesting white. Cooked pears and pineapples, a touch of peaches and apricot all in jelly. Finshing mineral. Good white. Almost Gold color. "
3639,1736719,"Very easy to describe.   Grapefruit tropical nose,   Pallet is crisp and sharp,  tropical,  pineapple, passionfruit.  Short body mid length finish,  lemon tang,  minimal acid is well balanced."
3640,1736719,Very floral and citric. Good acidity that goes well with food but too much just for drinking. Good intensivo and Lovely yellowish colour.
3641,1736719,This Alenteano DO is made exclusively with Portuguese grapes - Antão Vaz and Roupeiro. It is fresh with hints of passion fruits
3642,1736719,"Surprising, pleasant aromas of roasted almonds and honey. Excellent acidity and quite a lot of body. Long finish."
3643,1736719,Nice one for quality price!
3644,1736719,"Very soft, low body, almost watery, but fresh and fruity. Nothing special. Took with seafood sauce tagliarinni, Brazilian way."
3645,1736719,"Bastante suave. No calor e gelado, da conta do recado."
3646,1736719,"Suite, light and tasted. Very good at the swimming pool!"
3647,1736719,"Tipical green wine, medium to high acidy, flowery and pineapple tasting notes."
3648,1736719,It is a good white wine! It presented some citrus aromas and flavor! It is very refreshing and equilibrated!
3649,1736719,Acidity. I get some stone and citrus and with a nice tangy finish. 
3650,1253179,"Lean and clean...  awesome with the squid, tuna and sea crackling we had.  High acid and some floral notes too.  Seafood wine for sure."
3651,1253179,Excellent wine which we drink on lads weekend in Portugal. Went wonderfully well with fish. 
3652,1253179,Belo branco fresco do Algarve
3653,1253179,"Diner and wine tastung with golf friends at Monte Rei, Portugal"
3654,1253179,"Light, summery but not overly sweet"
3655,1253179,"Excellent wine from Algarve,  Chardonnay with Arinto,  a light yellow-lemon color,  with greenish reflexes. Nose: big salty minerality and fresh acidic citrus, some green flowers. In the mouth: fresh acidic citrus, lemon, lime, red grapefruits, peaches, passion fruits, white currants, fresh green herbs, and a lot of mineral notes. Wine fresh, fruity, mild, balanced, medium body, creamy, with nice fresh and salty-mineral finish."
3656,1253179,"Stone Fruits, dry, acidic, went so nice with the fresh fish we ate, wasn’t heavily watered, delicious "
3657,1253179,Light and crisp. Blend of Chardonnay and Arinto. Rather surprisingly some soft cheese on the nose though this did reduce in the glass. Lots of grapefruit with some lemon and tart green apples on the palate. A little acidic for me - could do with a little more balance
3658,1253179,"Vinho Regional Algarve blend of Arinto and Chardonnay.  Pale lemon with silvery highlights. M(-) nose of verbena, underripe grapefruit, very faint peach and gunflint.  M. body and acidity; low alcohol.  Lean, with pronounced intensity of white peach, lemon and white pepper.  Some residual bubbles contributing to freshness on palate.   OK but very forgettable."
3659,1253179,Easy crispy fruity Chardonnay 
3660,1253179,Very good with cheese and fruits.
3661,1253179,"Nice Chardonnay, great with fish"
3662,1253179,Prettige drinkwijn ams het warm is
3663,1253179,"Nice and refreshing, their is definitely a taste of Chardonnay in the wine. Definitely worth it. "
3664,1253179,Good light Summer white
3665,8386795,"(3.8) Alvarinho from Tejo - my favourite style - dry and dense with gentle fruit. SS tank fermented, unoaked.  Mouthfilling intense and short on the palate with loads of limestone minerals and salinity.  Finish adds more salinity and citrus notes. Medium acidity."
3666,8386795,Very nice refreshing Alvarinho from the southern Portuguese region of Tejo and not as one might expect from the northern vinho verde area  Clay and limestone soil  Very nice citrus acidity balancing the minerals  Recommended    
3667,8386795,"Tejo VR, Central Portugal Alvarinho  Pale gold (so pretty!)  Nose is very inviting: toned down with citrus rind and orange blossom, mainly peach syrup, ripe orange.  Minerality in mouth is great - you can taste the terroir (chalk - clay soil). It’s synced with lemon, lemon rind.  There’s either no sugar or there’s very little. Good and long! Would be great to take with you for a dinner party to pair with cod."
3668,8386795,Lemon citrus orangeblosom 
3669,8386795,Super interessante 👌🏻
3670,8386795,Light acidic wine quite. Apple 
3671,8386795,"Fresh, fruity, zesty with nice finish. That different taste that makes it stand out from the rest. Definitely need to try! "
3672,8386795,Interesting local saucignon blanc. Surprisingly spicy. First impression were of chilis (not the first but the fine taste). Refreshing wine to enjoy on a sunny terrace just like that.
3673,1957956,"Impressive. Full-bodied and distinctively tannic (not overly though), oaky with sight of dark berries in the palate - lacks completeness though and there is this feeling of ash. 4.0-4.25"
3674,1957956,"Full, powerful, yet humble. Very well treated tannin - obviously pepper but not too aggressive. A very satisfying vanilla aftertaste carrying the oak through the pallet."
3675,1957956,"This was an amazing wine with deep characteristics, so similar to cabinet sav. I would definitely pay the price for this wine. "
3676,1957956,"2 hour decant. Really rather nice, in a restrained way - purple - subdued nose - smooth with a little grip - redcurrants, blackcurrants - long finish."
3677,1957956,"Brownish colour, with a vegetable nose, tomato leaf, and a lot of spices! Black pepper, juniper, cloves. Some iron and rust. Needs to open a little bit. It is still good for a decantation, taste is bery delicate, velvet textures and already some leathers and horse sweat. Smooth tannins, high acidity, dry, some caramel and toast, dark chocolate, very balanced, some red fruits still, very surprising. But the jams are taking their place. Medium long finish."
3678,1957956,"This was good, but not memorable. Probably a 3.75. No tannins. Mild acidity. Fruity with dark berries and plum."
3679,1957956,"Smooth, black berries, hint of pepper, slight tang"
3680,1957956,"Nice round body, still earthy, nice with meat dishes, enjoyable!"
3681,1957956,Too soft and sweet for me. But still a wonderfull wine. Let it breed at least 30 min before you drink it.

3683,1957956,"Lovely, smooth, fruity, not too heavy. Good acidity."
3684,8176049,"3.8/5. Very nice Alvarinho.  Lemon, red apple and peach on the nose. Palate is long and lively with quite high acidity. Lemon zest, green apple, grapefruit and salty minerality. Worked perfectly with finger food including fish tacos. Should be quite cold (8-10 degrees) when served."
3685,8176049,3.7 Fresh balanced white wine - citrus lemon zest - very mineral from the north of Portugal 
3686,8176049,"Since 1870 and for 5 generations the Guedes family has captivated our palates with lovely crisp Portuguese wines. Their labels are recognizable worldwide.   100% Alvarinho, from granite soils (hence the name). Manual harvest. 9mo in steel with battonage + 9mo in bottle.  Bright straw colour. Tropical fruit and grapefruit notes. Palate is refreshing with chalky acidity, notes of citrus and solid minerality. Finish is rounded and long.  Thx @[1|1261314|Myles Cook] for the ‘chalky acidity’ note, you nailed it!"
3687,8176049,"A fine expression of this grape. Like a surfer battling one of those tsunami like waves on the coast of Portugal - but writ small; a refreshing brace of acidity, an undertow of pink grapefruit, and an undeniable salinity make for a pleasant ride. "
3688,8176049,"3.9. Loving this Alvarinho. Lemon zest, red apple, white peach and apricot on the nose. The palate is lively and textured with lots of chalky acidity and salty minerality. Fantastic length on the finish. Really impressive value here. "
3689,8176049,"Batonnage 9 months.In the nose tropical fruit,also grapefruit, lemon. Is a very young fresh wine and aromatic. In the palate we can fell the good acidity and mineral persistent, peach and pineapple in the final. "
3690,8176049,"Almond, dry stone, lemon, lime, saline- packs a punch, could stand up to a variety of foods."
3691,8176049, An interesting wine with a light yellow colour and mild aromas and flavours similar to Sauvignon blanc. Pear and green apple.

3703,5815551,"This is a rosé, despite what other ratings may indicate. Has a tart front, like a sour orange. Very juicy, medium acidity. Would be really nice on a hot sunny day. "
3704,5815551,"At first I thought it's just anothet rose, at least not too sweet. So I put it back to the fridge. And I gave it another try and it's really worth it! Cool it down properly! :)"
3705,5815551,"3,0⭐Ordinary rosé from Alentejo, living on the edge between enjoyable and drinkable.😅 🍇T. Nacional, Aragonez, Syrah. 👀Shiny ""orangeish"" salmon. Very few tears. 👃Delicate and shy with raspberry, orange blossom, pear and some other floral notes I was unable to pinpoint.🤔 👅Fresh, a bit unbalanced, light-medium body, on the sweet side. Acidity goes a bit off. 🏁Medium finish with a just ok aftertaste. 🗒️Keep an eye on the temperature, a few degrees above 10°C and feels a whole different wine (for worse)."
3706,5815551,"A very nice Portuguese rose! Strawberry and a floral bouquet! What else you could wish on a Rose? A light wine with a moderate acidity, just perfect for warm days! Cheers my friends! 🍷🍷"

3720,1606772,"The wine was oh, so very highly recommended by the sommelier in the restaurant. It is good, really quite good but far from the ""brilliantly-fantastic"" as advertised. Still...it accompanied the lamb in the most appropriate way."
3721,1606772,One of the best Douro Wine that I ever taste... Very good Great Reserve

3723,22322,I just love this oily deep complicated wine. This is a great example of just how to make a wine. Pato is supreme in this area. 
3724,22322,"A magnificent Portugal 🇵🇹 night, #4. The last of the whites before we move to the reds (Portugal has amazing whites with aging ability and more, however this night was focused on the reds). A very tasty white from Bairrada, made from the local grape Bical, by master of the Région Luis Pato. Med body and med+ acidity. Complex and elegant it would benefit from few more years in the bottle. It has oak and butter,  citrus (lemon) and peach, stone and honey. It’s just a preview for what Portugal whites may be 😉"
3725,22322,"Bical grape-based Portuguese white, with 6 months aged in Portuguese chestnut barrels. High minerality, pear, apple, apple skins. Delicious "

Long finish Balanced from high acidity and full body. Complex due to secondary and tertiary aromas. Pronounced. Long finish. Wine is outstanding  Suitable for bottle ageing as will continue to develop tertiary aromas"
3731,22322,"Bical with the adding of 30% Serial coming from chalky clay soils. Lively with nice precision and a bit of pith. Really intense with nice, vivid lemon, pear , baked apple and spice nuances. Juicy and focused wine of great freshness and lovely acidity!"
3732,22322,too oaky not enough acid balance

3735,22322,Luis Pato makes great wines.. a rebel genius Lovely citrusy flavours.. a little citrus oils..lovely structured.. good acidity.. some smokiness.. elegant but serious as is all his wines
3736,22322,"Elegant Cercial variety from Bairrada.   Discreet on nose, stone fruit, orange peel, nuts, very light, elegant and precise. Discretion and  elegance. Curiously it improved the following day. "
3737,5376404,"🇵🇹 Muito agradável este Riesling da Beira Interior, tem uma cor palha claro, nariz vegetal e cítrico destaque de toranja, algumas notas florais, na boca é seco com muita frescura, bom volume e suavidade, uma acidez fina, termina longo.  🇬🇧 Very pleasant this Riesling from Beira Interior, has a light straw color, vegetable nose and citrus highlight of grapefruit, some floral notes, in the mouth it is dry with lots of freshness, good volume and smoothness, a fine acidity, long finish. "
3738,5376404,Unusual to find riesling cepage in Portugal. Refreshing flavors.
3739,5376404,"Very interesting and odd riesling with lots of layers of body. It is sweet with notes of honey, but a bit watery in the mouth despite is strong profile."
3740,5376404,"Dryer and more acidic than German late harvest Rieslings, it still has grapey, almost muscatelly notes on the finish. A keeper. "
3741,5376404,"Зашкаливающий пиаш! Я не знаю сколько, по ощущению все 2.8! Pale gold bright color Nice aroma full of expectation for wet leaves, oily, dried apricot, silky nectar. But. Rubber, wet apple, lemon juice. Extremely high acidity. rustic, too natural style. Even for me.  13% 2017 "
3742,5376404,"Riesling is one of my fav whites, typically from the Mosel or Alsace. This is an unique experiment of this fantastic variety in an unexpected region and terroir. A good result, a structured wine with strong citrus and minerals notes. Balanced acidity "
3743,5376404,"3,8⭐My first Riesling tasting. 👀Deep golden yellow. Slow tears.  👃Orange zest, grapefruit and a hint of minerals touch. 👅Medium-full bodied. Balanced and with spot on acidity. 🗒️This show a profile different from every white I have tried so far. Feels a little liquorish, but still is not sweet. Not really gastronomic (for me) but goes well at the end of the meal by itself. 😁"
3744,5376404,"Funny, tasty but far from surprising; fails to compare to other Portuguese wines."
3745,5376404,"Good acidity, floral and mineral"
3746,5376404,17/20 @ Mr. Santos afterwork
3747,5376404,I found this a very interesting Riesling.
3748,5376404,Presents delicate mineral aroma with citrus notes.  In the mouth is structured and intense.  Medium and pleasant finish.  Very gastronomic and with good acidity.  Accompanied very well shredded cod with onion and olive oil.
3749,5376404,3.5* for this Beira Interior white wine. Aroma focused on citrine fruit and early petroleum. In the mouth is a dry wine with notes of lemon and petroleum. Short persistence in the mouth with good structure and acidity. Elegant white wine with good balance and good alcohol. Cheers 🥂
3750,5376404,Good surprise. Very mineral and not boring at all. Drinking very well but surely with some potential to age and to develop the more classic Riesling notes which are now just apparent
3751,5376404,Mineral com toque de damasco com boa acidez 
3752,1463721,"Lighter red in terms of body (but still 14.5%), balanced, smooth, hint of wood, no roughness."
3753,1463721,"Lovely, lively wine served up in a restaurant. Round but not too big. Goes well with wide range of foods including wine and chicken. Didn’t break the bank at €9 that’s in Portugal mind. "
3754,1463721,Nice white. Fruity but dry enough.
3755,1463721,Fruit driven full bodied wine that lingers on the front and middle palate light on the the rear though. Lovely dry very drinkable wine with or without food.

3757,1463721,Best Portugal wine ever
3758,1463721,No nose. Very smooth. Dry. Full bodied with good back palate. An easy drinking wine. A god wine with charcuterie and friends.
3759,1463721,A lighter style softer dark fruit with a bit of cigar box yet still has had firm tannins needs another year
3760,1463721,"Middle of the road red Tejo, decent without setting the world on fire.  The 9 months on oak make themselves noticed from the earthy nose with clove, black cherry and licorice to the palate with toasted tannins, OK acidity, black pepper and again clove and black cherry. Misses some fraicheur and complexity. 3.2"
3761,1463721,"Clear, with an intense ruby dark color, medium intensity in the aromas, and in the mouth too, not much flavour intensity medium plus body, but expected more, red fruits, spices and unfortunately a presence of  greenish tanins... Bit more time in the bottle and I am sure it will earn some more stars..."
3762,1463721,Very good value; smooth on the palette  
3763,1463721,"Smell: fresh strawberries. Reminded me too much of merlot. Medium tannin, a little astringent on the finish bit the finish is short. Not really to my taste. 2.5 stars."
3764,1463721,"Touch of sweetish candy, but just a bit, not disturbing at all, gives the wine an interesting character. Has good acidity."
3765,1463721,A bit of oak rounds up this wonderful wine

3779,4851681,Dry and crisp… tropical and fruity. Bold in flavor. 
3780,4851681,"I hope I can continue to find this.  Not a fan of white wine but this has a fuller, creamier body. Not too sweet or citrus."
3781,4851681,"Was not thinking that I’d say that with respect to white wine, but this wine is full-bodied, oily with very deep taste. Fresh nose, at the same time. Just highly recommend!"
3782,1232544,"Price pleasure ratio is purely amazing. Viognier with short barrel visit, rich nose with typical Viognier notes, rich, full and fatty! Remains digest and could easily compete with Condrieu ... "
3783,1232544,"Wow...very nice Viognier from Aletenjo, Dona Maria Amantis Reserva Branco 2016. Amantis in Latin means the one that loves. Buttery, rich, aromatic, mango, saline, white flower, tangerine, this is an estate grown wine of great elegance that can easily compete with some of good Condrieu I've had. Extremely high QPR, this is simply gorgeous! ABV 14%."
3784,1232544,Didn’t take many notes on this one. Very saline. White peach. Buttery.  Would like to revisit. Enjoyed at Pollen restaurant back in August. Clearing backlog.

3808,1783586,"Reasonable everyday wine well constructed with a pleasing balance, light and dry. "

3813,1165411,"Light bodied red fruit. Oak and leather are prominent. A bit of earth on the finish. Dry and medium acidity. I'm really impressed for 10$. It's not gonna knock your socks off, but it likely won't disappoint you either. I'm impressed. "
3814,1165411,"Very nice for the price point. I sense new aromas every time I stick my nose in the glass, starting with plummy vanilla with a milk chocolate undertone. I next pick up some pepper, smoke and leather. The palate is dry and balanced. Adding some of this to my lamb bourguignon tomorrow! "
3815,1165411,"Medium bodied strong acid strong tannins. Dry wine with purple fruits like dark cherry and blackberry. Strong pepper, tobacco and leather taste. Long finishv with since vanilla and oak.

3830,1473789,"Well I wasn’t expecting it!! It’s like drinking liquid gold, very smooth it feels like a sheet of silk in the tongue. Dry with a light hint of a after taste  of  lime"
3831,1473789,Had this in a restaurant. If that price point is correct then a) the restaurant are taking the piss and b) it’s a good drop at £5.28 a bottle but not at £30+!
3832,1473789,"High acidity, strong citrus notes, slightly sour, green apple. A bit unbalanced due to its very high acidity"

3841,1473789,Not bad at all 
3842,6762710,"Pale yellow color with strong citrus, tropical and floral taste combined with a very marked minarality. Quite a different wine, ideal for clams, oysters and alike. Full body for a white wine."
3843,6762710,"A bit dull.  Purchased on the basis of a very positive score, and was disappointed. "
3844,6762710,Rooftop party... Com amigos...

3854,5177427,Very nice  Big wine finish nice and dry 
3855,5177427,"Fruity, decent body and light tannin. Classic Touriga Nacional but much better than other examples from Algarve region (a region I tend to avoid!)"
3856,5177427,"A crazy grape I never heard about until I visited Convento do Paraiso 2 days ago. Sousao is a bit of a bugger to grow well apparently, so they only make this wine in good years as otherwise it just doesn’t work. It’s inky black in the glass, nose full of young, ripe and juicy blackberries and some lifting notes of pepper, herbs and savoury characters. Palate is bright, fine grippy tannins, high acidity, medium body. Acid juicy blackfruits and cured meats on the finish. Great wine. Look out for it."
3857,5177427,2014 Deep red. Temperanillo cab sauv and Souzao Packs a pleasing punch with character and depth.
3858,5177427,"Rustic and robust with sandy tannins, offering boisterous aromas of black currant, dried dark fruit, and a touch of toasted cedar. Exceptionally good for a back-country wine at leas than €20. A great find! Paired with Bacalhau Grelhado com Coentro e Alho at the “La Cigale” in Olhos-de-Água in Algarve, Portugal. "
3859,5177427,"Very good red, body, flavors, depth "
3860,5177427,Wow. Just stunning. 
3861,5177427,"Smells of leather and dark fruits. Tastes of chocolate, cherry with light spice "
3862,5177427,A bold wine with smells of tobacco and cherry. Medium tannins mean a smooth wine. It’s a full wine that sits nicely in the mouth. Tastes of dark fruit. 
3863,5177427,"Nice and dry with taste of forest berries and plums, notes of oak and spices on palate."
3864,5177427,blackberry oak liqueury 
3865,5177427,"Dry, not overly bold on fruit but very smooth and very pleasant. Needs to breathe for an hour. "
3866,5177427,"Sadly wasn’t as vanilla and oak as some of the reviews suggest which I love, rather dry with dark fruit, better slightly chilled in my opinion, wouldn’t buy it if I saw it in the UK especially with the carriage, I don’t think it’s worth it. "
3867,4448221,"This is a powerful blend of touriga nacional, trincadeira and cabernet sauvignon. Oak and pepper on the nose and even more spices on the palate. One of the spiciest wines I’ve had. The finish displays high acidity and firm tannins. It made me feel a bit dizzy after a single glass. Would probably be good with grilled fatty meats."

3871,4448221,"Interesting wine, very herbal and vegetal. Red fruits, full bodied, strong tannins and creamy. Smooth finish"
3872,4448221,"Touriga Nacional (40%), Trincadeira (30%), Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) It's a young wine with aromas of black cherry, plum, strawberry and cherry. Fruity, with soft tannins and a medium and persistent finish."
3873,4448221,Nice Transmontano medium body dry red with a hint of fruit and tannin notes. 
3874,4448221,"Stopped off at Orpheu bar and restaurant while wandering the beautiful streets of Porto. Saw this on the list and gave it a whirl. Really peppery nose, light and refreshing red. Cherry, raspberry, really delicious. It's got a slightly spritz finish, very gentle. Easy drinking summer red. "
3875,4448221,"A very solid blend of 3 varieties I like very much separately. Touriga National, Trincadeira and Cabernet Sauvignon. But just like in case of Dão wines this is not my terroir. Too sharp though its aromas and flavours are dominated by very ripe, even overripe aromas and flavours. Ruby red colour. On the nose ripe cherry, plum, dried fruits with nuances of chocolate, pepper, chocolate. Medium+bodied on the palate with sharp acidity. Flavours of smoked plum, black cherry, strawberry with again chocolate notes."
3876,4448221,"Round and fruity, plum, black cherry and even a hint of strawberry. Soft tannins with chocolate and wood on the finish. Maybe I'm emphasising the softer aspects of this wine because it's been open nearly four hours. Great accompaniment to a barbecue. "
3877,4448221,Very light and easy drinking
3878,76378,"Brilliant! Raisins, caramel, toasted hazelnuts. Fantastic long finish. "
3879,76378,"4.8 95p. Brown with a slightly green edge. Very complex and deep. Dried apricots, prunes, violets and and a stronger oak compoment than in the younger vintages. Superb balance between sweetness and acidty. Soft, elegant snd powerful at the same time. Long, lingering finish. Choose 1937 instead of 1940, as they are equally expensive, and 1937 is better! Choose 1966 or 1985, if you want to optimize QPR.  13-"
3880,76378,"Outstanding, I am not experienced enough to really say. However this is by far one of the best experiences I have had with ANY wine. Mind-blowing"
3881,76378,Drinking port with the angels ! I often think colheita more complex than vintage port. This has been in the barrel for 18 years before bottling
3882,76378,"Fruity, nutty, toffee, with delightful acidity - a rich, intense and concentrate port wine that never stops to amaze me - a very elegant port "
3883,76378,This port makes my heart sing. Forty five years--1963 to 2008 on oak. Magnificent balance. Pairs well with a 60 year old pre embargo cigar.

3888,76378,"Beautiful dark orange-brown color with reddish hints. Brilliant clarity.  The aroma is acidiously fresh and vibrant with notes of orange peel, kumquats, raisins, prunes and brown sugar.  The alcohol is a little intrusive right after opening - with a vauge turpentine note. Tastes great with juicy-sour, ripe fruit and sweet, fatty caramel. Long aftertaste. Yum! "
3889,76378,"100 rating!!!!! OMG soooo complex. No where near dead. Vibrant sweetness and acidity with lovely light fruit and amazing maturity. Beautiful dark golden, caramel color. Notes of roasted nuts, caramel, dried fruit, fig, prunes, yellow plum, dates, raisins, oak, chocolate and vanilla. Holy shit this was a mind blowing experience. "
3890,76378,"I don’t drink a lot of port but maybe I should pick up the pace cause this is mind blowing excellent, walnut caramel creme brûlée dry apricot raisin, but the palate/texture is even better cause it’s not fat lazy and killing you softly sweet, nope it’s beautifully balanced with more crisp caramel apricot coffee toffee with kick ass acidity that keeps it alive and kicking. Wow 😮 "
3891,76378,"Whoa ! Fantastic wines , a blessing to your taste . silky texture., caramel almonds velvety nuts ripe apricot and vanilla  ! "

3895,1378131,"3.75... Fresh and young, ok for country style lunch"
3896,1378131,"Full body but not too heavy, bold but well balanced. Interesting and unusual mix of grapes for Douro."

3900,1378131,Time out market Lisbon. Full bodied red. Absolutely fantastic!
3901,1378131,A distint nose where we can feel the oak. At mouth it is harmonious. Tasted on a blind wine tasting.
3902,1378131,A superior Douro wine. Red fruits definitely...but the plum takes you off-guard. Meticulous wood and minerals dimensions embraced by medium soft tannins. The 2014 vintage was enormous. Will but and explore the wines of this producer. Cheers!

3910,1781887,"Dark fruit nose, fruit and Carmel palate"
3911,1781887,"Very drinkable, great BBQ wine. It's difficult to choose red wine in Portugal as there is so much choice and prices can be ridiculous.  Recommend this one as a low cost quaffing red. "
3912,1781887,Just finished a great bottle in Vale Do Lobo - spicey with undertones of liquorice and cherry - great with red meat dishes!
3913,1781887,Excellent for it’s price. Fruity with a touch of oak
3914,1781887,"Quite dark ruby with a purply hint.  Medium nose with liquorice, pepper, blueberry, rhubarb. Pepper very present at the beginning of the taste. Lovely! Peppery finish. Good acidity and medium tannins. Alcohol on the high side makes it broody and peppery. "

3924,1136728,"Ok wine, but doesn't linger in the palate..."

3926,1136728,Thick full flavored red with spicy notes and lush taste of black berries. Trace of nutmeg. Very long smooth after taste. Some filmyness that lingers on your tongue. Recommended but a bit too expensive. 
3927,1136728,"Deep garnet. Complex nose... subtle fruits of dark berry and plum, scalded tomato, red meat, nuts, vanilla and a floral aspect. Palate of dark cherries, plums and dark berry moves to a peppery mineral stage. Juicy but not acidic.  Fine tannins enter the  mix offering dry, bittersweet chocolate and some nuttiness. A joy to try port grapes in such a style. Posole and Barbacoa tacos. (Also, Asiago cheese....Devine!)"
3928,1136728,"Interesting Douro, blend of Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Barroca, black berries aroma, equilibrated acid and alcoholic levels, it grew a lot in 7 years. Medium ending and good tannin, plum, woody, chocolate and black berries tasting notes."

3966,1222530,We’re having a lot of fun experimenting with the variety of Vinho Verde that is available here in Brazil thanks to the Portuguese heritage of the country: old habits die hard even across generations. This was almost our favorite amongst the batch so far this year. Luckily summer here seems to be dragging on and giving us more excuses to drink this crispy treatment of a few varietials.   This 3.8 pale golden 👁blend of Alvarinho and trajadura delivers a subtle 👃🏻 of Lime and Crisp White Melon. 👄 lightly acid.

3972,1199469,"Drunk in a wine bar called ‘wine not’ in the heart of Lisbon, that has wines only from Casa Ermelinda Freitas, which is one of the biggest and I’m not afraid to claim one of the best wineries in Lisbon 😋 actually I wanted to try some monovarietal Petit Verdot, but as far as I understand the year was not good so together with Pinot Noir they just did not appear on the market 🤨😔 so I was offered Cab Sauv as a substitute 😬 and I’m pretty happy about my choice - raspberry, oak, balsamic, licorice, varnish 🤤"
3973,1199469,"Inky dark core. Intense nose, floral with cassis, ripe herbs, pepper and a hint of oak. Good purity on the palate, fresh dark fruit and cassis notes, steady but ripe tannin, fresh acidity, discreet oak and rather long finish."

I gave up & picked this: Alvarinho bubbles from 🍳uintas de Melgaço: the 🍳M Super Reserva to be more precise. Maybe some information about the term 🍳uinta for an extra star? 🍳uinta comes from Latin & refers to the tradition in Portugal a long time ago that farmers ‘leased’ property from large landowners for a 5th of the yield. Now it’s used widely, also for homes, like my parents’ 🍳uinta da Luz where I had it. ⬇️⬇️⬇️ "

4006,2476123,Fine and persistent bubbles in this Alvarinho traditional method sparkling. In the nose a touch of floral and tropical notes as well as lime and nectarine. The time on the lees gives a slight touch of yeast which balances nicely with freshness and mineralogy.

4055,1662725,"Deep bright pink colour. Floral nose with red berry fruit, plum, fresh herbs and citrus zest. the palate is rather full for a rose , fresh  backbone, crushed red fruit and a medium to long finish."

4063,1662725,"My first Souhthern Portuguese white ✅. Made from 50% Fernão Pires, 30% Vital, and 20% Arinto. Nice nose, and that's about the best I can offer.  12% alcohol. Clear pale lemon color. Clean medium intensity youthful nose of pear, sweet lemon, and lychee. Dry with medium body and medium acidity. Medium+ intensity flavors of tart lemon and lime. Medium finish length. (2019)"
4064,1662725,Drank in Obidos
4065,1662725,"Fruity and sour notes, medium body and peach, lime "
4066,1662725,"Lemon, fruity. Fine cup of wine"
4067,1662725,Not good smell and the taste also not accaptable as quality vine
4068,4568994,"Blackberry and plum nose. Medium (+) acid and medium tannin. Light fruity wine with a jammy undertone, not bad. "
4069,4568994,"Dark dark purple not showing any sign of ageing yet.   On the nose it’s a little closed still, not much fruit, a little spice and cedar.   Buckets of black fruits, blackberries, brambles on the palate with youthful tannins. Still got a few years to develop into something more interesting.   "
4070,4568994,"Deep purple, sweet fruity nose, ripe black cherry, hint of menthol, cedar.  Lovely chewy tannins, full body, black fruit, treacle, long length, sour finish.   Very enjoyable, but could do with bit more time to soften and food. Hard to believe it’s 5 years - a keeper."
4071,5441003,"grapes came from Dão, really nice and balanced wine "
4072,5441003,"Wood and black pepper, bell pepper. Medium body and medium acidity"
4073,5441003,Notes de pruneaux et fruits confits
4074,5441003,Round musky oil texture. Tar and smoky nose. Wet tea rose. Light airy body allows to enjoy it longer. Good balanced distinct spiciness. Delayed apple acidity. Paired with argentinian steak and fresh salad. Dinner at home in Lisbon.

4078,2756213,Nice balance of black fruits and earthy with the right amount of tannins.  Full bodied with deep ruby color. 
4079,2756213,"Nacional+Franca #8: In fact this is Touriga Franca with a 'small %' of Touriga Nacional, and a very nice combination it is too - great fruit and texture with hints of rusticity and a spice of fresh acidity and young tannin. Highly enjoyable. (14% abv)."
4080,2756213,"Back to the rubber aromas, jam, nice acidity  Douro table wine tasting 12/20"
4081,2756213,"Rich, ripe, blackcurrant fruit, notes of pen ink, an opaque purple color, beautiful density, beautiful fruit and silky tannin are all present in this naked, unoaked and rather hefty dry red wine. "
4082,2756213,"Nice. As it says on the tin it’s unoaked. It’s smooth, fruity, and stands up well with meat dishes or on its own with no visible means of support. Wine connoisseur’s tip - it’s done with hidden pulleys and rope. "
4083,2756213,"White port 10 year, sweet, perfect with cheese"
4084,2756213,"Garage wine series, note of the best Douros that I have tasted.  👃 in sync with the body, spicy and hot, clearly spent some time in oak, red fruit such as cherry and strawberry.  🍷 quite dull, simple, medium to low acidity but it lacks a soul, weak tannins and aftertaste. "
4085,2756213,Nice heavy wine with some smokey notes and ripe berries. It is important to open it up quite some time before drinking. 
4086,2756213,"Fat and sweet nose, opulent but nice, some body"
4087,2756213,Scaldu in De Weert Bornem

4094,5929190,Forget dry but this ‘tropical’ wine certainly managed to get my attention. I liked it more than my wife. She thought it too flowery. 
4095,5929190,"Very smooth wine perfect to drink with fish dishes,fruity wine and very light. mango tropical green apple passion fruit lychee "
4096,5929190,Awesome smell an sweat taste
4097,5929190,"That's a wine! So tasty and fruity! Starting with some green apple then comes mango and finish with floral. Soft and very nice ballanced, pleasant aftertaste. Worth to try! "
4098,5929190,2021.05.29 with my sister!!   Piano always great❤️ 
4099,5929190,"Arrived late in Lisbon and thus opted for a mediocre hotel dinner instead of seeking out a restaurant downtown. Found this gem though, a Douro white. The floral notes are reminiscent of an Alsace pinot gris or riesling, but it’s absolutely dry as dust with acidity to boot. Downright great!"
4100,5929190,"Nice moscatel, dry and quite balanced with flowers and lychee on the nose. Nice salty touch, good in combination with fish soup. "
4101,5929190,"Very nice white wine from Portugal, lots of tropical fruits, mango takes controle. Soft on the tongue. "
4102,5929190,"Tropisch fruit, sinaasappel, grapefruit in de afdronk. "
4103,5929190,Fruity and aromatic.
4104,5929190,Pale yellow. Exuberant on the nose as a moscatel should be. Extremelly floral with notes os passion fruit and green apples . A great Douro White. 
4105,5929190,"A very pleasant, fresh and slightly buttery wine. Really outstanding. Saúde!"
4106,5929190,"Deliciously perfumed, good structure and right acidity. Absolutely ravishing"
4107,1719383,"10 EUR in the restaurant. Deep red colour. 👃 is delicious, delicate, soft. Nuts, skin.  Mouth is elegant, earthy, good acidity, little oak. "
4108,1719383,"Dark red nice fruity smell, cherries, balsamic. Soft tannins nice everyday winr"
4109,1719383,"Awesome! Oak, earthy, mushrooms, balsamic, the syrup kind. Packs a punch"
4110,1719383,"Great wine , price vs quality . Douro never dissapoints you . 10 euros , tastes like 20 euros for sure "
4111,1719383,Cheeky little number.
4112,1719383,"Dense, fruity, well balances acidity cherry balsamic bitter almonds asparagus almonds "
4113,1719383,"Very good red wine, nice to accompany a good meat meal. Good quality for money! "
4114,1719383,Thin and acidic. Thought it might get better once it had time to breathe but it didn’t.
4115,2166743,"Nice Douro wine, but still doesn’t beat vinhas velhas from Crasto. Ruby red, medium body, pronounced acidity, red and dark fruits, tobacco, vanilla, spice. 13,5% abv. Old vines of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Francisca."
4116,2166743,Quality deep flavour Shiraz
4117,2166743,fruity an cask matured little dark and spring fruits 
4118,2166743,Much to like here. Acidity on point and fruit for days. No messing around with American Oak. No funny stuff. Just decent winemaking. Five stars.
4119,2166743,This is the style of red wine I like!  Robust with deep dark fruits but with depth and quite some maturity. I ponder on whether it was a 3.5 or 4 rating but decided on the latter because of its complexity and good value. I’m impressed by the quality of inexpensive Portuguese wines I’ve found this week. 
4120,2166743,"Excellent Vin de cette appelation, très intense bouquet fruis rouges"
4121,2166743,"Another great Duoro. Concentrated, good tannins, still needs some rest to soften. Beautiful"
4122,2166743,"Young beauty and the beast: As far as you can see, terroir covered with colored terraces up the hill. Jean Hughes Gros, a painter of this wine, is a Frenchman who fell in love with Douro and decided to stick around and make very good wines. Quinta Dona Francisca is his most recent project. The owner of the winery is António Augusto Ferreira, a former master brewer at Unicer. His passion for Douro land and wine led him to leave the previous life, made around the beers. Look at the wine reveals deep ruby..."
4123,2166743,"Another great one from Douro. A mature wine wine with taste of ripe dark fruits like plum and black currant, hints of oak and tobacco. Dry palate with a tasty palate."
4124,2166743,"Bold and fruity, wooded and smokey, tobacco and smoke.  Great tannins!"
4125,2166743,"3,9. Fruity and dry. Thought it would be a little smoother... "
4126,2166743,"Medium body, smooth wine full of fruit, mostly blackberries and vanilla . Delicious!"
4127,2166743,An elegant Douro wine that will bring joy in any occasion. Perfect tannins structure enable an excellent ending. Notes of plum and oak. Some small hints of vanilla. An excellent wine! AK
4128,2166743,What a wine! Slight effervescence. Massive punch of berry coming through. Tannins are there but not too much and it is quite complex and structured. Little bit of Tobacco and little hit of vanilla.  This is a lovely wine. Worth a case on first taste. 
4129,2166743,"Red berries, tobacco"
4130,3071409,"Not so intense red berries in the nose. But some cherries and a little strawberry maybe. Velvet, smooth. "
4131,3071409,Satisfying medium body
4132,3071409,"fruity, very refreshing!"
4133,3071409,Usually not my type of wine BUT really amazing surprise! Warm and smooth! On my top 10!
4134,3071409,"It's realty good, not too harsh or too fruity, smooth in the mouth. 5 stars"
4135,3071409,Very good rosé on a hot summer night with food
4136,3071409,"Soft golden color, clear, aromas of peaches and ripe citrus. Medium soft mouthfeel bit of grapefruit and white stone fruit, soft but lasting acidity... Thinking of boiled soft fish..."
4137,3071409,"Didn't know the wine yet. But really nice, fresh. Goes well with fish also"
4138,3071409,3.75... Beetroot and red currant
4139,3071409,Canela in the nose. Red Fruit. Good with rabit.
4140,3071409,Very surprising wine!
4141,3071409,Full Bodied but at the same time feels light at taste 
4142,3071409,Fruity and very drink able 
4143,3071409,"Round, smooth, low tannins, very drinkable.  Will be good with meaty Italian dishes."
4144,3071409,"red fruit, red currant, very good!"
4145,1408119,"Full Douro, old vines. Dark, intense, best after decanting and waiting half hour."
4146,1408119,"Full body, dry, medium+ acidity, lots of tannins - still somewhat closed. Very dark color. Lots of sweet dark fruit, chokeberry, blackberry and some blueberry, balanced oakiness (20% aged in steel tanks to not overpower the oak levels). Nice complexity and smoothiness. Long ending. Really promising, needs more years to become a star, which is likely. Oddly shaped bottle."
4147,1408119,"First Portuguese wine we have tried, very impressed... "
4148,1408119,"Surprisingly complex! Full bodied, fruit forward and a light acidity. Drank this in Portugal at a tasting event and was so pleasantly surprised! I will buy  this at home in the states for sure as Portugal wines are a tremendous value with wonderful full bodied flavors. This wine was just released, aged 18 months in a barrel and 2.5 years in a bottle so it makes the wine very smooth and drinkable. Cheers! "
4149,1408119,Really full taste but still an easy going experience.
4150,1408119,Ripe dark fruit and oak dominate. 
4151,1408119,"An interesting bottle. Still young, flavours of Indian species shop. Very dense and full bodied with grippy tanins."
4152,1408119,Nice and deep body with tints of wood. Enjoyable nose but somewhat fleeting aftertaste.
4153,1408119,70/100 @ yeatman christmas wine experience
4154,1408119,Complex and roasted aromas with black fruit. Strong and polished tanines. dense at mouth. endless final.
4155,1408119,Fruity and with a great body. Excellent choice 
4156,1408119,I was expecting more for the price we paid.
4157,1408119,Very soft and tasty
4158,1408119,"Nice complex wine, quite a bit of sediment. Interesting bottle!"
4159,5978529,"On the nose, wood cream, tropical fruit and ever so slightly smoky. On the palate we start with oak, then cream, yellow/tropical fruit and in the finish, minerals. Subtle, yet beautifully balanced. Paired very well with goats cheese. "
4160,5978529,"A surprise to me. Drank a 2014 bottle and got impressed. This one as well - with less petrol notes - but an acidity and complexity which make it a winter white wine. Excellent white wine, from a region that is becoming a reference in this segment as well. Well done."
4161,5978529,"Butterscotch, oak and cream. Very good to drink in its own. Needs a little ageing, if I was to be critical.   "
4162,5978529,"Simple, but again a little too dry"
4163,5978529,Fruity and I love it 
4164,5978529,Very light nose and flavor but an astonishing long finish. A very delicate but interesting wine. Subtle yet complex. Very tasty. 
4165,5978529,"Wow!! Beautiful dinner wine. Autumn yellow colour, on the tongue hints of butter, tropical fruit, oak, all well balanced and with a rather long finish. Recommended! "
4166,5978529,"Deep gold colour. Quite mute nose, pear and almond but wow, high intensity palete. Tropical fruits, wood, honey, bit of spice. M++ finish. This 2014 has developed pretty well. Going to get pretty intense with more time. Needs food. 4.2*"
4167,5978529,Great easy to drink house white at casa do Lago 
4168,5978529,Delightful; paired beautifully with tuna crudo with grapefruit and blood orange and fennel 
4169,5978529,"Very pleasant wine, great with seafood tapas."
4170,5978529,"Clean and clear. Subtle tropical fruits, you get the stone fruits on the nose and palate.  Good acidity with a surprisingly long and pleasing finish. A moderately priced wine that makes it easy to drink on any given day!"
4171,5978529,Tasty fruit and simple good
4172,5978529,"Smooth, fruity and clean "
4173,5978529,Creamy long finish very good value
4174,5987174,"Very pleasant glass, light and spicy on the nose, smooth strawberry and slight acidic cherry in the mouth"
4175,5987174,"90/100 Not a typical Pinot Noir but a nice take on the grape. Made by a minimal intervention producer. Notes of cherry, rubber, sea salt, and clay. It’s silky on the palate with bright acidity. This is an interesting take on Pinot Noir, it’s definitely in the category of a “natural wine” but it’s well done. Plenty of juicy red berry fruits with low amount of tannin. Handled lightly and it’s clean for a natural wine, which is a big plus."
4176,5987174,"Strawberry, cherry and spicy notes, medium acidity, bold, balanced, medium plus pleasant finish, very good quality! Enjoy!"
4177,5987174,A most unusual Pinot but certainly interesting. Not a typical grape variety from Portugal but it could become one. Not quite a 4* but close. 
4178,5987174,Excellent to enjoy with food. Light and smooth 
4179,5987174,"@ BairraDão (04/05/2019) #1/5: A Bairrada Pinot - an outsider in Baga land: delicate, with a nice sourness of youthful berry/currant fruit, a good streak of acidity, and light, natural tannin. Some potential here. (argilo-calcario; 12.5% abv)."
4180,5987174,"Vivino Leuven goes PN My first PN from Potugal presented by Fred. High in alcohol, cherries, licorice, eucalyptus with earthy spices and mon cherrie sweets. "

4183,5987174,"Pinot Noir tasting Vivino Leuven #6! Portugal 🇵🇹 and Pinot Noir, does not seem usual to me! We could expect a Portuguese wine from Fred but I never tought he would find a PN. great to see the difference between east and south Europe!   Palate is warm and sunny like the country, nive cherry 🍒, spices, pepper, and tannins present also some bitterness in taste. Special wine, not the best PN but nice experience! Thx Fred!  Rate 3,5⭐️"
4184,5987174,"Vivino leuven Pinot Noir experience #6  Pinot Noir? From Portugal? I mean warm, hot portugal 🇵🇹...  A nose, composed of kirsh tones, a little mint and red currant.  A soft feed but then comes the alcohol sting (wauw). A sour red cherry and a dusty accent... Imho, this contains too much tannin for a PN. Yep, a wine as warm as Portugal itself ‘cause of the alcohol and with a little bitter accent on the finish.  Especial!3⭐️"
4185,5987174,"[Vivino Leuven: Pinot Noir Education 4/11] Also in Portugal PN is grown... I brought this beautiful bottle from the Bairrada, beautiful mainly because of the shape and presentation. Interesting but not the star of the evening. Nose with beeswax, cherry, raspberry, red apple and rhubarb followed by a palate starting off velvety with spices and dry tannines but then the tart acidity turns a bit wry with malolactic notes and an alcohol glow. 3.0"
4186,5987174,"Like strawberry foam on the boiling jam, mixed with red cherry and a minty freshness. Summertime fruity refresher."
4187,5987174,"Well balanced, smooth pinot noir with medium+ acidity and red fruit, cherry, raspberry Paired with a cous-cous w/ chicken stew and was perfect match!!  Rated half a star more for being such an unexpected surprise to have this pinot noir from Bairrada. "

4207,1267227,"Ai ai it's love af first sight. Portugese at it's best, softly seductive. Buttery, apricot, Galicia melon. When at temperature it gets a smokey taste. This one skipped the acid. Unfortunately the Portugese all drink the best themselves. Every sips will bring you to the best of Portugal. "
4208,1267227,"Superb Antão Vaz. Perfectly balanced, lovely fruit and nice viscosity. Top of the pops! Saúde!"

4221,2795324,"This is one of the best roses for me, it brings out the freshness of the Douro Region and it has a nice acidity. It's not very sweet, however, it's as sweet as i want a Rose to be"
4222,2795324,Poor quality Rosè.Not worth inspite of special offer at Aldi.Same winery has some good wines like red wine Callabriga. They should not spoil their reputation with such cheap products like this Rosè.

Dark rubi red color. Nice, quite intense ripe red fruit and plum preserve aromas with notes of wood, spices and toasted coffee. Full-bodied (15.0%), unbalanced Portuguese wine due to over acidity, strong alcohol and robust, somewhat rough tannins, showing tartness, bitter and not persistent finish. A 74-GB pts wine.

4315,1187390,Garnet colour with abudant violet hues. Powerful wine with great longevity
4316,1187390,Dark red powerfull wine from Portugal. Very pleasant smell and long and powerfull after-taste. Perfect for grilled meat.
4317,1187390,"To the eyes, intense and shiny violet, almost black, delivers the aroma of ripe black fruits, which unfold in the mouth, along with flavors of dark chocolate, coffee and leather. The broth is round, full-bodied, with soft tannins and robust acidity, in addition to persistent aftertaste. It is ready to be enjoyed, but some years will probably still make this Syrah even more evolved. It is good to decant at least 30 minutes before serving."
4318,1187390,"Nice. As it areas it evolves. At the end of the decanter there was smoke oak cherry blackberry.   It got a bit tannic, so appropriate food would be nice with it. However, complexity allows searching and enjoyment solo. I agree with the crowd score of 4.1. cheers 😘😘😘😘  "
4319,1187390,"4.1 is too high, but 3.7 or even 3.8 is appropriate score. Nice experience! Nose is full of cherry, chocolate, wet oak barrel, notes of green pepper and grilled burned meat. Taste is full of sour cherry, blackberry,  oak. Good wine!! "

4342,1192972,"If this had a bit more vegetal aromas I would have thought it’s a Cab Sauv. Strong cassis and dark fruit flavors as black berry and black cherry. Old oak (no vanilla) a bit earthy (which literally comes from all the residue). 6 years in, I’d give this another try in 5-10 years to further mature. "

4353,1192972,"Strong on mouth light on the nose, should be opened 15-20min before. Good to keep some years (7-15)"
4354,1192972,"Pretty crappy at pop time, but after the 4 hours, wow! Deep purple with long, slinky, slow purple legs - heat with a faint fruit hint in the nose - this is big in the mouth - think ""blackcurrant wine gum"" and you're pretty close - but a quality wine gum, it must be said - huge finish - everything about this wine is over the top, but, somehow, I'm enjoying rolling it around my mouth, and then I want more! 4 hour decant. 16% (yes, sixteen)"
4355,1192972,"Huge Portugese heavyweight that is still a baby. Needs much more time to fully develop but is strong, dark and begining to suggest its true qualities. Dark fruit, firmly expressive tannins. Oak. Vegetable notes abound. Give this beauty at least 5 years and maybe 20 to shine."

4413,76433,Nice wine  Good moments to share with good friends 
4414,76433,"Apple and floral nose. Buttery palate with lemon, green apple and slate. Very dry. "
4415,76433,Was good with fish
4416,76433,Light golden color. Cantaloupe and honey on the nose. Yellow fruit on the palate. Good.
4417,76433,"Medium color. Fresh, mineral and citrus nose. Acidity is medium to high. Citrus, gooseberry taste with medium after taste. "
4418,2059899,"Exiting Pinot from Lisboa. Full of raspberry, and fully flavored with red berries. Nice distinct body with some strong alcohol nites. (14%).  Enjoyed it to a delicious Cod😋"
4419,2059899,"Smoky, sharp and succulent. Young red fruit, orange peel, earthy, white pepper. Light bit powerful. Translucent red color. "
4420,2059899,"Light Woody notes, coffee and cocoa, not a typical Pinot noir "
4421,2059899,Nice. Strawberry notes. 
4422,2059899,"A local favorite. Excellent Pinot, needs to breathe to open up. But once it does, it’s great. Fruits slightly acidic and a medium long after taste. Had it with lam for Easter and it’s a good pairing 👌🏼"
4423,2059899,"Fruity, red fruit, almost some strawberry, cherry, light body, and good acidity "
4424,2059899,What a surprise. So light colored but tasteful -  berries. So mild but strong. This wine is not boring. Love it.
4425,2059899,"Very pale with a browning rim - looks like it has more age than 3 years. Aroma is mainly red cherries, raspberries and some slight strawberry. I get a little damp earth.  It was quite tart in the mouth - maybe a touch too much acidity. The finish was medium, and it didn't improve with air.  I was expecting a bit more from this unfortunately. "
4426,2059899,"Light, well balanced acidity with aromas of cherry and strawberry.  Pronounced mushroom flavors with a hint of that typical Pinot herbaceousness.  Finishes clean and crisp"
4427,2059899,"Supper @ el vinos (a fav London haunt). Saw this as a little something different being 100% PN from Portugal   Pale ruby, delightful nose lightly perfumed, cherry, hint of mushroom.  Light cherry palette, sweet ripe fruit, little spicy warmth  Wasn’t expecting the depth - great qpr and lovely reward for going off piste! 3.8 bumped up to 4 for good service and a reminder of what delights can be found in Portugal!"
4428,2059899,I'd buy this again!
4429,2059899,Amazing wine! Love it
4430,2059899,"Very impressed. Held up even after hours of being open. Complex, fresh, red fruit. Great structure and tannins with a little grip on the finish. "
4431,2059899,A not so typical grape variety for Portugal. Enjoyed it. Has some structure. 3.8-3.9
4432,2059899,First glass I had of this had sweet oxidation. That nay point to it being open too long (was in a wine bar) but might also point to clues that it may be quite fragile.   I don't think this would keep well so would mark it down as one to enjoy now.
4433,1216925,A good riesling. Not ready yet. Need at least 2-3 years before drinking.
4434,1216925,A good sticky desert wine
4435,1216925,"Nice late harvest! Produced in the Lisbon region, from Riesling grapes, this sweet wine shows a nice balance between sugar and acidity but is a little short of depth and complexity for my taste. Golden yellow color, intense aroma of green apples and fruit jams (particularly orange). Sweet with good acidity level and a medium enjoyable finish. Just fine!"
4436,1216925,Dry yet sweet. Great dessert wine. The color is super with a Resling. Refreshing variety!  On the nose a little musty. 
4437,1216925,A deseet wine. Expensive but worth it. Lightly acidic with honey and pineapple notes. Delicious. 
4438,1216925,"Lovely desert wine, not too sweet"
4439,1216925,"Had in Alma, Lisbon. Big raisin notes. "
4440,1216925,"[Quinta de Sant’Ana 7/7] The last in my winery tour should give me some extra kudos with 🔡 judge @[1|9845107|Alex GGunno]! A ®️iesling from Po®️tugal, and a Late Harvest to make it even more special! And it’s bloody good!!! ®️eally!  Interesting nose with rhubarb, cherry, apricot and sorrel followed by a palate that’s of course sweet but also blessed with phenomenal acidity, orange and sorrel. Loved it! 4.1"
4441,1216925,"@[1|29011840|Mr Kevvy] comes up with another unique wine to challenge @[1|6272997|Wineman Steve] and me, a botrytised late harvest Riesling from Lisbon! Surprisingly deep amber colour. Punchy nose of mushroom, cheese rind, marmalade, apricot, polished wood. Sweetness (95g) disguised by blistering acidity. Definite salty edge to the finish. This was a great pair with some mature cheddar."
4442,1216925,"Portuguese dessert Riesling (as you do) at the end of an excellent tasting across the miles with @[1|6272997|Wineman Steve] & @[1|10821251|Richie G]. Colour super-dark for a '16, colour of a '10 Vin de Constance. Mandarin, pithy, saline nose, showing off coastal proximity. Super acid, the botrytis comes thru but is instantly wiped. There's lime, honeycomb, & some pastry notes. At the end, there's a saline palate, & the sweatiness you associate with a Madeira; not quite sweet enough to cope with blue cheese."
4443,1216925,"Kindly provided by @[1|29011840|Mr Kevvy] for a Portuguese Teams Tasting with him and @[1|10821251|Richie G]. There were two striking and memorable things about this wine: the searingly high levels of acidity (which I didn’t mind but it seemed to mask some of the flavours and if I had another bottle, I’d be leaving it to the 2030s!). The other was the colour: I have malt whiskies which are paler (though this had a reddish tint to its hue). Citrus, saline, minerality and apricot."
4444,1216925,"Nr#3 at After Holiday Tasting, Riesling from Portugal. Nose of furniture wax, paint, taste is high acidity. Overripe grape fruit, bitter. With troutmousse mmm, much softer. Thanks Willy."
4445,1216925,"Dry, simple,little boring. Some apples."
4446,4894460,"Lovely - complex with layers of cherry, black fruit, chocolate and strong tannin. Good oak too. Needs oxygenation to fully expose (Apr-19)"
4447,4894460,"The Freixo family have been making wines for over 200 years & this Family Collection (a fairly large “limited” production of 13,333 bottles) is lovingly crafted from Touriga Nacional, Cab Sauv & Petit Verdot with 14m in new French oak.  Opulent with rich fruit (blackcurrant, blueberry & blackberry) & deft oaking, bringing vanilla, toast & oak. It evolves beautifully in the glass & over time herbal qualities start to show, especially on the nose. Dry with med acidity & seductive tannins: this is a beaut."
4448,4894460,"Impressive red from Alentejo. Dark ruby with purple hues Floral aroma with ripe red fruit, wild berries, vanilla, oak, toast, pine resin. Full body, robust but beautifully polished, with very well tamed tannins, good acidity and a lingering finish with notes of fruit and vanilla. As it opened up after decanting, the fruit notes intensified and it also revealed eucalyptus and spices. Superb! "
4449,4894460,Great alentejano full body red fruits 
4450,4894460,Stunner - great QPR!
4451,4894460,Fantastic as always !!!!

4453,4894460,"high in tannin with dark fruit and oak character; vanilla, char, still young atill good but will be more smooth in five years"
4454,4894460,"I visited this winery last February. It’s a stunning place. Like the Guggenheim in New York but built entirely underground  We had a tasting and tour. The wines were nice enough but on the day, nothing really special. I bought this to bring home. It’s their top wine. I hadn’t tasted it so was a bit of a risk as limited space in the luggage! Well it was a great decision! This is lovely. A top wine. Complex, immediately attractive, sophisticated and multi-layered. "
4455,4894460,How awesome is this wine?
4456,4894460,Wonderful aroma. Wonderful flavor. Smooth and with a lot of dill. A very very nice wine.

4465,1425432,"Yes, we had a tour at their winery. Still this is an above average red from the Alentejo. Drink with portuguese fishsoup or any grilled pork dish. Black fruits, Lusitano stable tones yet not too heavy. "

4476,1189511,"Deep crimson color with nice tearing. Sour plum, sour cherry, summer berries and a hint of oak on the nose. Taste wise there are hints of cherry, dark chocolate, wild blackberry and a good dry finish. Pairs with grilled meats, game, cheese and fatty fish. "
4477,1189511,"Dry but balanced, warm, elegant with chocolate and blackberry notes. A lot of the Beira tintos are a bit too dry for my taste but this one is not...still super dry but did not go over the limit for me. Saúde!"

It’s the first, but not the last time we will have this wine. Cheers!"
4506,2044638,"Wines from Portugal, June 10. Great Wines of Dão tasting, #4 of 6. Winemaker is Manual Vieira, the Pope of Dão. Medium ruby color, balsamic and red fruits aromas, fresh acidity, firm tannins and long finish. Aged partially for 18 months in used French oak. 14% abv. Rate 3.9"
4507,2044638,"Another Portuguese powerhouse. Made of the niche Alfrocheiro grape. This dark colored red benefits from a little air time, releasing the rich deep flavours and heavy scent. It has an earthy bitterness that's very appealing and dried ripe plum or tutti frutti. Enjoy!"
4508,2044638,"Well, this was a strange one at the Portugal tasting. My first association was a Dogliani; purplish colored, unfiltered. Spices and fresh near ripe red fruit, vivacious and a little tangy. Med+ acidity and med tannic. Lacking balance due to acidity. It is either a love or hate style or this was an off bottle, I recon. Not really my thing. 13 pts."
4509,2044638,"3.7. Pine, velvet, old books and my grandparent's house on the nose. In mouth it goes on the same way, but blurry. After 30 minutes, some bitterness appeared. Med-hi acidity."

4515,2044638,"Medium body, a little tannic , nice nose of red fruit"
4516,2044638,"Still young wine, with great potencial to evolve. violet color. Dark berries aroma. In the mouth is fresh, tasty and full bodied. Long finish"
4517,2044638,"Taut, muscular dark fruit, with great structure and considerable refinement. The ripeness comes through on the sweetish finish, but there's a wonderful dark, brooding nature to the wine.  From an excellent, medium sized producer, in what is possibly Portugal's highest quality red wine region, Dão.  Relatively rare to find Alfrocheiro made as a varietal wine.  This could age for 5-10 years, although no need to wait. A lot of pleasure to be had right now!"
4518,2044638,"Delicious varietal from a prolific blended grape. Wine is probably peeking down by its raisin and Danes jelly. Also by it’s orangeish halo. Tannins are smooth and acohol balanced. Fruit that seems sweet, but it isn’t. Great buy."
4519,2044638,"4,0⭐My 2nd Alfrocheiro monovarietal. 👀Dark ruby with slightly brown rims. Abundant and slow tears. 👃Shy at first. Oak, vanilla and a bit of black fruits. 👅Medium-full body but quite fresh. Dry and with medium-high acidity. A bit of astringency from those tannins, let it breath a while. Medium finish. 🗒️I'm starting to really enjoy these monovarietals, although this one didn't reach M.O.B.'s one level because it showed a bit more unbalanced. I think this would match very nicely with some octopus dish."
4520,2044638,One of a kind!

4524,1191944,"Last of the 2008’s. Fruity, tannins still in evidence but not dominant. Softer Than I remember. I didn’t decant it. Also slightly lighter than I recall. Delighted to have tried it again. "
4525,1191944,"Ripe dark fruit, minerality, good acidity with elegant structured finish."
4526,1191944,"""Luxury""-wine Tasting: Now a red wine from Dão! Really fruity bouquet with aromas dried red berries and cherries with nice hints of different herbs and oak. Quite juicy on the palate, with flavours of cooked fruit and a nice interaction between the firm tannins and the fruity and slightly sweet flavours. Medium long and jammy finish with notes of chocolate and oak in the aftertaste. Lacks a bit compexity, but all in all also this one is not bad! Could be great with a nice piece of chocolate or Pasta gratin!"

4529,1191944,"Warm rich woody and red fruits on the nose, palate follows the nose without being heavy, not sophisticated but a good crowd pleaser, highly drinkable on a cold afternoon"
4530,1191944,"Muddled Red fruit at the beginning with good grip from the tannins providing a nice finish.  Lacks clarity, great value for people who like dry reds.  "
4531,1191944,"Had this one the other night when I decided it was time for something different.  I need to do that more often!  Medium to full bodied with thick, grippy tannins, aromas of dried lavender and roses integrate into the lush palate of blackberry and blueberry, black licorice, light oak and hints of chocolate.  The fruit condenses into a dried fruit aspect as some minerals evolve with those familiar scents of a wine with some tears under its belt.  Excellent!"
4532,1191944,"Dao is not a tegion I usually drink. So, i dont have a solid base of comparison here. This obr was inpressively fruity. With a subtle sweetness at the finish (which I usually dislike.)."

4726,1400619,"Plum, Blackberry, oak, leather, earthy.   🗺 Region: Dao, Portugal 🇵🇹 🍇 Grapes: Touriga nacional ⌚️ Vintage: 2015 🏰 Winery: Casa de Santar "
4727,1400619,"Full-bodied and powerful wine, which has nevertheless preserved a certain elegance. Ripe red fruit, spices and a gentle touch of vanilla. Lively acidity and firm tannins. Dry but with an impression of sweetness/ripeness."
4728,1400619,"Medium bodied wine. Intense dark fruits, long finish and medium tannins makes this a wine a no brainer for both fish and meat dishes."
4729,33324,"It's beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! Dried fruit on the palate, Christmas pudding, walnuts. It's very long and pleasant. Almost as old as me!:-)"
4730,33324,"Not a bad way to end a fabulous dinner.  A delicious vintage port with impressive concentration and depth, so ripe, so balanced with its verve and veins of acidity. Luscious, seductive, creamy but not cloying. 1985 is not a renowned vintage but this Fonseca is exceptional. Just entering its prime drinking stage, right in between its youthful ascent and emerging maturity. Lots of life ahead. "
4731,33324,"Rich plums and syrup on the nose. Thick mouth feel, stewed red fruit on the pallet, slightly tart with a spicy peppery finish. "
4732,33324,Nothing to say against!!!!
4733,33324,"inky purple  beautifully balanced  elegant, smooth, lovely  on the nose blackcurrant and coffee  chocolate on the palate  long velvety finish  paired with blue cheese  19% ABV"
4734,33324,"A definite step up from the Taylor's from the same year yesterday, fruit more massive and deeper, raisins and plums, with a certain spiciness, maybe star anise. A bit spirity on the finish to start with but this mellows quickly and becomes a wonderfully smooth and close to perfect aged vintage port. Plenty of room for further ageing too."
4735,33324,"So young - probably 3 decades too early.  So Microsoft 1.0 released, Madonna and A-Ha had huge hits, Maggie Thatcher was England’s PM, Australia had a Prime Minister serving full term (Bob Hawke)...the old days.   So the wine - kirsch, dark red fruits, figs, earth, spice, liquorice, fine spirit nose. Young and vibrant. Cork 19.5%. "
4736,33324,"Deep ruby-garnet in colour, aromas and flavours of rich jammy dark fruits, loads of blackberry, black currant, black cherry, earthy minerality, well integrated tannins, very full, round, and smooth with hints of dark chocolate on the long finish...over a minute."
4737,33324,"What unbeatable value for money. This vintage port is over 30 years old and can still be bought for £25! The mind boggles.  Deep Ruby red  Intensely aromatic, pure, deep, round - a joy on the nose. Baked red fruits including raisin prune fig blackberry accompany a ton of sweet vanilla chocolate caramel cinnamon and a hint of violet.   The palate displays typicity with fruit concentration, good acidity, long length and all elements include alcohol in balance. Can you spend a better £25 in wine?"
4738,33324,"I don't drink port often,  but this was a perfect end to an enjoyable night out at The Savoy.   Rich, supremely matured red and black fruits but still an intensely fresh bite consisting it's age.    Hold it in your mouth and enjoy the rich acidity and the following luxurious smoothness.   A warming sensation with spiced smokey finish.   Loved this, I would definitely be interested in trying port more often."

4743,33324,"Still vibrant primary fruits. Only a slight loss is colour on the rim, but still far before garnet. Tannin is still very grippy. Structural balance suggests decades ahead for further development"

4745,1141833,"Fin lys amber color, complex nose of figs and cedar and caramels, smooth and velvet and great great length and good fortified berry taste fantastic port with krones is 🤣"
4746,1141833,"Pungent. Old ripe fruits, bordering too old! Smooth delivery. Just a full on assault on tastebuds. Spices and easily drying oak. Bit bitterish end note ruins the balance."

4758,1141833,"Excellent Port! Clear black tea-looking, light caramel smell at the beginning and fantastic taste: average sweetness, smooth and drinkable without sugary aftertaste.

4761,1226145,"Full bodied portuguese wine, fruity, but not too 'bombastic' ours was served a little too warm so scoring partly based on assuming it is even better when slightly cooler."

4784,1648179,"Dense red color, dark and opaque. The nose at first was a bit closed before showing its complexity of dark cherry fruit, plum essence, spice box, cedar, tobacco, eucalyptus and earthy tones. Tasteful, solid tannins and growing but thin and elegant in the end. Very fresh, granite mineral scented finish!"
4785,1648179,"Blackberries and plums, with notes of pepper and licorice. Full bodied, well balanced with a long length. Very surprised with this one."

4859,4089126,"Christmas at my in-laws.  Had bought this on a very awesome recommendation by @Mike Mills 71.  🍷  Decanted an hour.  Darkest deep ruby.  Nose of blackberry, prune, plum, anise, earth, damp tobacco and muted spice.  Palate follows nose but more austere with added red currant and mint and peppery.  The spice is more intense.  Full bodied.  Dry.  Tannins are dense yet somewhat integrated.  Nice acidity.  Long length.  Cherry, prune and minty finish.  Worked well with a Cantonese style dinner.  4⭐️"
4860,4089126,"Really enjoying this (yes I’m typing my review mid bottle...don’t judge! :P )  Maybe it’s still a little young, fumes a bit harsh on the nose. Past that however is a very rewarding Alentejo Blend of Syrah (my fave), Alicante bouschet, and Touriga Nacional.   👁 deep ruby and nearly opaque and leggy 👃🏻 the jam hits almost as fast as its relative youth even at 5 years . That classic Bouschet smoke on the nose, black currant and fig. My mouth is getting excited already 👄 pepper and bark, dry to the balance point"

This is 100% full bodied wine   Very light on the palate not very acidic comfortable to swallow.   The tannins are great as this does clear your tongue so that you can enjoy some heavy game or cheese.   I would say Acidity is low as wine is not a sour.  14.5% Alc. But you don't feel a major burning sensation in your throat.  4.5/5 **  D  "

It’s a developed wine with notes of plum, dried cherry, brown herbs, rose petal, and tobacco. High acidity and medium level of tannins. You have to like mature wines to appreciate this.

4900,2346003,"Dry, good value"
4901,2346003,"(August 2016, Manila). This 2012 Douro has a very dark opaque ruby robe. The bouquet has good cherries, red fruits, and smoky notes. This is a medium dry, medium bodied wine; but on the light side. It is so well balanced! No component dominates another. It is savory, smoky; and good abundant ripe dark fruits. It had a slight dry finish that lingers a bit. It is already at peak age. Do not cellar any longer. No aeration required. Elegant wine that reminds me of a good burgundy; but fraction of the price. I'm happy!"
4902,2346003,"Fruity. Medium - full bodied. Blackberry, plum, dried cherris, chocolate and spices."
4903,2346003,"A bit bland, but not entirely unpleasant "

4909,1169273,"Youngish red, medium depth. Nose is straight forward, simple but clean. Forest berries like blue and ripe lingon. Mouth feeling is medium depth, clean and young harsh tannins and accidity. Should be fine with Jamie Oliver’s pork fillet with rhubarb and jamon serrano baked in oven with sage, garlic and olive oil.

4918,1169273,A great example of terroir where its environment pleasantly impacts the wine.  The warmer temps and higher altitudes produce that concentrated flavor. This is a joy to drink. 
4919,2795722,"Quinta dos Carvalhais Reserve White 2012 has a beautifully bright, straw-yellow colour. Its aroma has notes of butter, honey and citrus fruit, mineral touches and a vegetal element that adds freshness and complexity to the wine. The aromatic complexity imbued by the oak barrels in which it aged, and hints of fruit and honey are perfectly balanced by a lively acidity. It is an austere and elegant wine with a long, delicate and refined finish."
4920,2795722,"Hay colour, some golden, apple aromas but also pineapple, passion fruit, very light, grass, and vannilla. Taste a bit unbalanced, acidity all over the place, it needs 2 more years. Hopefully, but it wont change much. It is what it is. Heavy wine, some minerality as well. Bitter, medium short finish."
4921,2795722,"Smooth, but full bodied.  Little oak, great with monk fish and tuna!"

4927,2795722,"Tasted at Feira do Vinho do Dão in Nelas. One of the best whites tasted at the fair. Balanced, very well made, beautiful complex nose, and showing phenomenal elegance and caracther in the palate. Another evidence of these wines benefiting from a few years in bottle..."

Ruby red colored wine with a nose of predominantly red fruit, some spices, anise and vague hints of sigarillo. The palate has a very smooth feel and has a nice acidity. It displays continuing fruit added with notes of vanilla, chocolate. Minor tannins are present near the medium long finish. A very nice, characterful and well balanced wine ! "
4940,2424181,Ruby in the glass with a perfumed nose of red berries and a touch of vanilla. Raspberry and red fruit on the palate with elegant tannins and good structure. Smooth and silky mouthfeel with good finish and a spicy background. Good complexity. Very enjoyable with our roast chicken.
4941,2424181,"On  the nose showing alluring notes of  mixed red berry fruits, vanilla bean and cappuccino flavors, well married with hints of spicy sandalwood and cigar box scents. Displaying a soft and elegant body, fine tannins , wild berries and remarkable complexity towards the long and savory finish."

4943,2424181,"From the point of view of wine it is nice. Calm and soft red fruits aroma. Long, round and excellently balanced in mouth. But it has nothing very special. So it is ideal, but boring wine"

4946,2424181,"~4... Good one, starts from cherry and unripe plums with pretty quick addition of milk chocolate and lightly salty caramel which became prevailing over fruits notes... Medium body, silky tannic, with moderate acidity requiring a breath to calm down... Probably, still has some potential for improvement with the age... 👌🏼"
4947,2424181,"🌟🌟🌟🌟, PnP. Worcester wine festival grand tasting. Deep purple red in color with medium viscosity. On the nose aromas of red fruit, cherry, and raspberry.

4955,1974261,"Raisins, leather, good acidity, ripe tannins. Long finish"

4957,1974261,"Cor tinta carregada, taninoso, corpo, frutos do bosque."
4958,1974261,Gentle. Lacking personality 
4959,1974261,After letting this wine breath for an hour it reaches its full potential. A bit dry compared to other Touriga Nacional but much flavor.
4960,1974261,I got drunk at a wine tasting and spent an unconscionable amount of money for three bottles of this stuff. I regret nothing. This wine makes me want to defend the honor of Prince Henry the Navigator.
4961,1974261,Ok with food Better than Spanish wine. 
4962,1974261,"Black fruits, off dry, full bodied with medium + finish. Very   reasonable for the price. "

4970,1794953,"Beautiful example of elegant Touriga Nacional from Dão. Lovely aromas of ripe red fruit - cherries & gooseberries - very floral with violets, and oak (still too much of it in my opinion). On mouth its a beauty, silky smooth with flavours of ripe cherries, good acidity and very easy going and full of elegance. A keeper, a real pleasure but give it some time for the oak to vanish"
4971,1794953,Very cool wine
4972,1794953,"Fresh for 2011, full, complex, minerality"

4979,1188780,"This is one for all burgundy lovers. Honey , brioche , vanilla. Beautifully balanced with a whack of fat. The only downside is maybe needs a little more acidity . Great value , it would be very hard to get a Chardonnay of this magnitude from burgundy at the same price."
4980,1188780,"Still too young. Too much oak yet (April 2015), but clearly worthwhile waiting for"
4981,1188780,"Not your typical gewurztraminer, but a very interesting wine."

4992,1188780,"A lovely glass with complexity in both the bouquet and the taste.  Golden yellow color. The bouquet explores citrus, white asparagus, white pepper and a hint of pineapple. A fruity taste of citrus, pineapple, apples and honey. The latter continues to the long and fruity finish with a hint of salty ending.  A complex and harmonious glass.  It’s the first, but not the last time we will have this wine. Cheers!"
4993,1188780,"Very well balanced, needs a little time to open up, nice acidity and not too fatty and round. Nice aftertaste probably due the acidity"

5007,1272103,"Very special. I don't know why they call it grape-pit as it tastes more like apricot, a bit of almond and green apples. Solid enough to accompany main dishes (fish, poultry). Fair price. "
5008,1272103,"Light straw color, a little bit unctuous, plenty of life. Citric but simultaneously round and fruity, we found here a well done wine. A joy to drink and to live for.  Very good.  "

5029,1314401,"Really wants food to go by, but easy drinking nonetheless. Extraordinary mouthfeel!"
5030,1314401,A wine straight from the Atlantic Ocean. This is not your typical Sauvignon Blanc. You get the salt and earth (mineral) mixed with a greener punch and a long sweeter end. Highly recommend it!
5031,1314401,"Intensity on the nose is probounced. Aromas of gooseberry, green pepper and herbal notes.  Acidity, body and finish is medium plus. In general - very good wine, especially for the price. Hand picked grapes and aging on lees - very interesting for Sauvignon."

5038,1314401,"Bright citrusy yellow colored wine with a savory aromatic of lime zest, freshly cut grass, green melon, asparagus and peppery goose berry scents. The acidity is enveloping and vivid,herbaceous notes on the lingering finish are typically of variety and terroir . Good value for money! "
5039,1227972,"Wrapping up Labor Day weekend with this nice Douro. Dry with balanced acidity. Spices, tobacco and wet bark. A cozy cigar lounge drink. "
5040,1227972,"Good easy Douro. Black fruit, chocolate, some creamy texture at the very back. Very nice café at Praça do Munícipio, Funchal. 82pts."
5041,1227972,"Maybe not a 4.0 but close. A smooth, even blend that offers distinct notes of cherry, black fruit, a dash of tobacco, a bit of leather, and a touch of oak. A smooth finish that lingers but doesn’t wait around too long."
5042,1227972,If you are looking for a budget Douro wine this is the way to go. Light and fruty. Deep with present tanines. 
5043,1227972,3.5 Not good at all!

5054,1266125,"97 rating! Big and powerful. Incredibly dense and full. Wonderful butterscotch on the nose. On the palate, big tannins with magical ripe blackberries, butterscotch, eucalyptus, passionfruit, mint and roasted coconut. A wow experience. Needs many years in the cellar and will age amazingly."
5055,1266125,"Very good wine, especially knowing it is already 15 years old. Keeping a great balance and freshness, very well integrated and delicious. Great"
5056,1266125,Looking for this if anyone knows of a place selling this other than Garrafeira Nacional or Veneza. 
5057,1266125,Finally doing my Portugal notes and starting off with a bang..  Colour is dark ruby with brown hue.. Nose is intensely jammy with black fruit and baking spice with chocolate and pepper aromas.. Incredible how much is going on there.. Palate is has loads of fruit and spice but not jammy as the nose.. This wine seems youthful and fresh and yet it has hit adulthood in human terms. Huge complexity and intensity without refinement.. This is wine made in the traditional way and feels that way..  Still too young..
5058,1266125,"Too pricey for what it offers, even after decanting it for 30+ minutes. Tinta Roriz, Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Barroca. RP96"
5059,1266125,"Deep dark rubin red wine from the Douro region. It's tannic and layered, full of complexity."
5060,1266125,"Slightly dirty deep garnet. Sweet, jammy, quite intense nose with ripe blackberries and tire rubber, getting nutty with air. Medium body, very smooth, nicely bodied with balancing bitterness and light acidity. Bitter chocolate, black pepper, plummy jam. Very long,  although the tannins are disappearing, still some mint, spiciness and rubber in the prolonged aftertaste. What a Privilege!!!"

5126,6170444,"Quite discrete and subtle in aroma and color. Low alcohol 11,5%. It will probably age well and be more interesting in a couple of years- now it s a very well made wine but felt like something was missing."

The grapes for white wines were sourced from terroirs (all above 550m, all 90+ years old) “that give us freshness and minerality, instead of the exuberance that sometimes characterizes the region,” said Ferreira, including, in the north, Pinhal do Norte..."

5134,6170444,High acidity and mineral.

5136,6170444,"On the nose the moscatel shines through. On the tongue, honey, peach and rosewater. Long dry finish. A very pleasant and interesting wine."
5137,6170444,"Field blend of more than 60 grapes varieties of old Vines from a single plot, single vineyard. Intense and expresive aromas of black fruits, prunes, violet involved with fresh aromas of oak, vanilla, pepper, licorice and wild flowers. Well integrated tannins, pleasant acidity, good structure and very long finish"

5140,1105380,"Alicante Bouschet is the 🍇 ( cornerstone of south 🇵🇹 Alentejo).  Beauty grape. Makes a dark coloured wine though the fruits are more in the red spectrum on the palate  Nose is Christmas cake , tobacco  and a dark Smokey leathery note underneath.  Palate has good depth to the stormy black raspberry with a balsamic / herbal kind of note  as it gets to its long dedicated finish.  Impressed enough to move up the ladder and demolish the next level Alicante .  Stay tuned.   🇵🇹 🍇 discoveries ✅.  Though 😃 here"
5141,1105380,"Deep concentrated ruby red in color. Displaying complex aromas of dark raspberries, spice cake and boysenberries enriched with savory scents of cigar box, roasted espresso and vintage leather.

5145,1105380,"If S (syrah) was bombastic, how do I call this? Tremendous powerful, in a way like the black wines of cahors, but with other aromas offcourse. Blackberries and black currants, partially overpowered by tannins. The 2013 vintage wines of this domain were, as it seems, layered on French oak. Good but no wow feeling."
5146,1105380,"Purple-burgundy. Nose fruity, palate full, still strong tannins with good acidity and balance. A very enjoyable wine."

Earthy nose with mint, black cherry, black currant, prune, oak, blackberry and black pepper followed by a powerful, spicy palate with big acidity, nice tannins, red cherry, black pepper and black prune. 4.1"
5153,1105380,"Terrific wine! Tasted it blindly and what a pleasure. Dark ripe fruit in the nose and on the palate are combined with a freshness of the acidity but also some pepper touches to make give it quite some body. The tannins are present but elegant and soft. The finish is long lingering and again very fresh to make this a heavy but summery wine. Top quality though it comes with a price (+€30). If I hadn't know the price, it would have received 4,5*"
5154,1105380,The wine was decanted for 2 hours and a little solids...were filtered out. Yummy big fruit and succulent flavours.  I was in Portugal 40 years ago and drank wubbish. Today has enlightened me in pursuit of grapes I can't pronounce.

Strong aromas of ripe red fruits with subtle notes of spices. On the palet fresh, juicy and fruity. The finish is long and elegant but without the usual dryness which comes with barrel aged wines. Excellent and exciting. "

5199,1274518,"We seldom leave a bottle unfinished. But with this one we did, because it did not impress and had a slight fizzy feeling on the tongue, so we replaced it with an alternative to better match the food. But…. I had a second glass  from the bottle that had been open for two days, and it actually got 10 times better!  Black current, pepper, oak, vanilla. Well balanced acidity.   So my tip: open the bottle two day before you intend to drink it, and then it punches above it’s weight!"

5203,1274518,"A nice red blend from Alentejano, Portugal. Aragonez, Alicante Bouschet and Trincadeira. Six months on French and six months on American oak. Saw several vivino users cheering about this one. I understand why! It's an interesting red wine with native grapes and a smooth taste. For only 5 euro per bottle a very good value for money."

5210,1274518,"MONDAY SYNCHRONE TASTING. This wine was best after 2 days open.  Day 0: intense ruby, developed aromas of liquorice, and disturbing burnt rubber. Oak, black fruit, strange fizz on the tongue. Berries, pepper, cinnamon . M+ tannins/acids/intensity/body, High alcohol. Started to bore me after three sips.  Day 1: ugh. Burnt rubber only, fizz really annoying.  Day 2: hey! The burnt rubber almost disappeared, fizz very remote and nice now! Now the spices and intense fruit come through nicely, more balance."

5216,3806688,"Medium bodied medium acid medium tannins. Purple fruits (blackberry, black currant, blueberries, cherry) mixed with spice and pepper from syrah and a finish with some oak. Would easily be confused with a Cote du Rhone wine, not your typical Alentejo wine. Not a personal favorite."
5217,3806688,Deep red with hot Alentejo sun in it. In mouth has a long ending with spicy feeling on the tongue. Has a lot of character. Very much worthy.

5277,2405775,"Unfiltered, organic blend from hands of a master of this kind of wines. FR oak helped in maturing this misty garnet gem of nature. Yeasty, overripe notes are frustrating at the beginning but it gets a solid go when aired sufficiently. 2h minimum to open up but then it's a heaven on the nose&palate. Developing, growing in all directions. Dark fruit coated into earthy basics with hints of lilac, baking spices. Solidly structured yet bloody wild. Bold, vivid, delicous, ticking bomb-pearl in 5+y. QPR! "

5279,2405775,"Wine made by the renome winemaker Paulo Laureano. It’s come from a blend of Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez and Trincadeira. Aged for 12 months in new and used French oak barrels, it’s has a deep garnet color with aromas of ripe fruit, notes of plum jam and wild fruits mixed with toasted and spice of the wood where it aged. Taste of a striking structure where the tannins of the slightly wild varieties stand out yet, which leads it to have a different, complex, extremely long and very persistent finish."
5280,2405775,"A solid Portuguese red. Needed to be decanted for couple of hours. Dark ruby colour. Herbs and figs on the nose bought me right away. Brilliantly balanced with strong tannins yet still elegant and smooth, flavours of smoked plum and chocolate, earthy thyme and black currant, lots of wood on a palate. Finish has a long extension of smoke and smoked plums turn into sweetish jam. Very much an enjoyable wine."
5281,1212857,Rich bouquet of ripe raspberry and brandy.   Silky soft texture.  Great port.
5282,1212857,"Nice port. It reminds me the two travels I have done to Porto, in Portugal. Lovely place. Amazing wines and food. Bold, plums, compote, coffee and chocolate notes.   Cheers "
5283,1212857,"ok Francisco... now we r talking. As Francis the chef saw my non approuval on the white,  brought, as a compensation, this awsome port to close matters. Bravo Francis... thx for your kindness... I leave floating after that... c u tomorrow... :-D"
5284,1212857,"Labeled as Porto, tasted like Hungarian desert wine. Absolutely pleasant! The timid bouquet unveiled a fruit bomb, full of ripe berries with a persistent note of pomegranate molasses in the ending. Maybe one of the most different wines I've ever tried!"
5285,1212857,"Black, opaque. Very tight and concentrated. Tobacco, stewed fruit, chocolate, kirsch, sweet spices, fig and plum. Very complex. Smooth but powerful. Very long. Outstanding stuff and even if it is extremely young in port terms, it's drinking very nicely now. I'm giving it a perfect 5 stars but incredibly, this still has room to get even better. Brilliant wine."

Rich & viscous w. chewy m+ tannins, m+ acid & high alc. Lovely richness w. crème de mure, black cherry jam, vanilla, cinnamon & raisin. Full bodied w. a long finish w. sweet spices."
5292,1212857,Properly full mouth coating port. The alcohol is evident on first opening but blows off and mellows on day 2. Fresh dark fruit dominates with plum and mulberry and a hint of date and raisin starting to emerge. A properly dry finish makes for a fine port.  Still has years of life ahead.
5293,1212857,Too sweet and sharp
5294,1212857,"Salty liquorce, minerals, amerone style, really nice. Fun to try in 5/10 yrs. Do not decanter too much, goes a little flat after 3 hours."

5302,3830208,"Packs quite a fruity punch of flavours.  A nice balance between fruity sweetness and a crisp acidity to leave the palate delighted.  White fruits, soft citrus, yellow floral and touch of pear skin in aromas.  Flavours, when nicely chilled, are vibrant with a zestiness along with fruits including green gage, apple, floral and more. A nice length that leaves the mouth salivating."

5308,3830208,"Good value for sure and a nice change from Alvarinho. Nice acid structure envelopes citrus notes like lemon, lime grapefruit and some tree fruit like white peach and a bit of floral white blossom. Nice minerality at the core"
5309,3830208,"Seafood lunch on the beach!!  What do you expect. Clean, slight hay tone but light and clean. Not long lasting flavours but that’s not what I want here. "
5310,3830208,"Fresh and green nose full of minerality, lemon w faint fennel and a fresh vegetal feel. Subtle hints of tropical fruit. F- bodied big pepper on palette, kinda like rocket but with only mild bitterness. Long. H- acidity. Dry."

5312,3830208,"Pale yellow color. The scent was at first bit unpleasant: strong petrol and gas, but it’s getting better white the wine is getting warmer. The taste is very floral, citrus, grapefruit and honey in the aftertaste. Dry and slightly mineral whitey from Douro."

Bold and complex, with good acidity and length.

5327,2805253,"Decent enough wine for its price. Achieved its purpose of momentarily helping me forget the pain of my professional mediocrity, made worse knowing what potential I once had, while the hopes and ambitions the 21 year old me had just make me feel bitter and angry at a life of fearful and terrible decision making."
5328,2805253,"The label says that this wine (from the Castelão variety) ""aims to show that the queen grape of red wines from the Setúbal Peninsula is very much alive"", and alive it is on this evidence: a good Castelão, nudging up to very good on value. It's high on alcohol (14.5% abv) and quite tannic but has enough freshness to hold a balance. Shows deep/jammy currant/cherry with suggestions of rubber, toffee/caramel, liquorice, dried herbs/tobacco, balsamic, walnut. A bit more intense on nose than on palate."

Medium to slight full body.  Very aromatic and good complexity.  Start with earthy, licorice, mint;  then dried fruits (apricot, hawthorn) and floral.  Dry and spicy in mouth.  Smooth tannins.  Quite acidic.  Long legs in glass.  Still vibrant after days if well kept.  Highly recommended!"

5491,1169273,"Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz (50:25:25). Clear, deep ruby. Clean, medium plus intensity aroma of blackberry, plum, tobacco, earth and vanilla. Dry, high acidity, medium plus tannins, full body and long finish. Palate confirms the nose. Excellent. "

5526,1189822,"Surprising color, light brown with some spark in it. Nose is probably biggest surprise with pleasuring tones of dry fruits, figs, raisins, prunes, apples and honeyed walnuts.

5532,1189822,"Perfect Colheita from a year which has a certain aura. Intense amber colour with most intriguing tears in the glass. Full and concentrated nose, dominated by a multitude of dried fruits, some spicy notes of rose pepper, cedar wood, and a subtle touch of vanilla. Extremely refined in the mouth, elegant, with a notable character and a pleasant freshness, helped by prevalent tannins. Long and persistent finish, extremely well masked alcohol - I almost fell in love - but alas, she's gone now. "
5533,1189822,"Születésnapomra I.  What a wonderful surprise I got today! Couldn't have antecipated such a fabulous treat. Such a fine gem.  Port wine is not really my thing, I confess. Yet. Could never really comprehend its soul. Maybe this one's a switch.  Within a fabulous aged amber hue, a perfectly conserved nectar flows. Elegantly alive, conveying honey dew coated figs, orange peel sprayed up dried fruits, in a full silky, stable and nostalgic path. And I liked this. Liked it a lot. Bottled in 2014 and born in 1984."

5535,1915147,Solid. From Clive 
5536,1915147,"Medium ruby color with medium plus aroma intensity and notes of  red fruit cheese blackcurrant plum oak berry jam. On the palate medium plus acidity, medium plus tannins and high alcohol. Flavors intensity are also medium plus with characteristics of red fruit  cheese , blackberry, plum and oak. Finish is medium and the wine is good "
5537,1915147,"Very dried, dark fruits. Too woody and leathery. I think its too strong in alcohol as it burns tongue slightly. Also very drying. Decanter 2019 box."
5538,1915147,"Rich and powerful red, with medium acidity and high alcohol that cancels the aromas. Decanted for a half an hour but doesn’t help. Cherry, plums, oak and burnt wood."

5545,1915147,"3.7 - strong and powerful wine with rich aromas (cherry, plum, and blackcurrant). In the palate it is very concentrated and complex, with ripe fruit notes. The long period of ageing in Portuguese oak, gives a very persistent ending, tannins need more time to integrate."
5546,1915147,Wine with aromas of red fruit and cherry. It shows medium-bodied and light tannins. Medium persistence.
5547,1915147,"Wintery goodness to be enjoyed with salty bites like strong cheese, serrano ham and focaccia. Would also be great with a rustic meat stew."

5558,1192279,Good value. Purple in color. Lots of Dark cherry on the nose. Blackberries and Dark cherry on the palate with hints of blueberries. Nice long finish. I am yet to taste a duoro that dissapoints
5559,1192279,Great surprise. High altitude wine
5560,1192279,Decent tannins. Deep purple colour. Quite strong. Good for red fatty meat.
5561,1192279,"Blackberry, chocolate tones - amazing wine!"
5562,1192279,"Between 3,5 and 4. Stunningly made, and outstanding value. Pure expression of fruit, very personalized, medium pure length of very dark currant fruit. Balanced and drinking very well. Great"

5564,6897402,"Still wine from a well known Madeira producer, mainly Verdelho with 4% Sercial in the blend. Nose has pear and blossom along with interesting liquorice root and fennel. Fresh and salty with some green olive tanginess on palate. Unusual and interesting."

5566,6897402,"Semi dry apparently. Hints of citrus. Some lemon? Fresh. Good for warm weather. I just know I liked it, quite, a, bit. Good to drink in a restaurant, if you haven't had it before. Not sure if I would buy it myself."
5567,6897402,"Very unbalanced in the mouth, super acidic, tart and salty. Nose is more broad, with quince, apples citrus and flowers. "

5569,6897402,Beautiful infused wine. Nice nose and easy on the pallet. 
5570,6897402,Dinner at Pedro Lemos in Porto
5571,6897402,"This wine was great after a long day of golfing and what can only be described as perfect weather. Golden straw in the glass, nose gives off oyster brine, saltiness, and preserved lemon. The palate is medium plus acidity and is zippy, confirming the nose with lots of lemon goodness. A great wine for a fish fry, oysters, or other seafood. Or to drink while enjoying a nice day like today. Cheers!"
5572,6897402,"Native grape to Madeira and you can definitely tell there is volcanic soil that has influenced this wine. Pale in color. Greenish hues on the nose. Lemon, lime, pear and apricot on the nose. Medium plus acidity, tart lemon body with some limestone notes. Mineral driven body. 3.7 stars"
5573,6897402,"Madeira still white. Apricot and pear nose. High acidity. Green apple, green smoothie, and pear body. Perhaps my first still verdelho! 3.7⭐️ bright citrus and tart green (color not young in age) notes. "
5574,6897402,"To be fair, I have a cold, which may be why I have to dive deep into the glass to smell anything. But as is, low intensity on the nose. Salt minerals on the nose, along with blossom, pear and nutty characteristics.  On the palate: high acidity, but it feels quite dull nonetheless. Medium finish. Maybe not fair to it to taste while having a cold. As is though, I am not impressed."
5575,6897402,"Light citrus color The nose full of tropical fruit, apricot, pear, orange and a touch of smoke  The palate is with creamy and mineral notes. Dry with crisp acidity but kind of unbalanced and with a bit strange aftertaste"
5576,6897402,"Was a bit too shy both on nose and palate.   Nose: More on the tropical side, like apricot and then the citrus notes of lemon and lime. But also some pear and apple is present. Very straight forward not that complex unfortunately.  Palate: A lot of acidity is present here. Some limestone notes as well. Citrus notes is clearly on the palate as well. But the palate is too shy. In the end when it was a bit warmer some honey turned up. Medium finish but only in the end. "
5577,6897402,"Medium dry with good honeyed notes, elegant flower notes and good citrus backbone. Medium to long finish."
5578,6897402,"Quite complex, very mineral and vulcanic. Surprisingly dry and fresh"

5583,6950382,"Second bottle of the evening. A very delicate note with spice and cherry notes. The body is light, i wasn’t expecting it because of the time that has been kept on the barrels. Mildly sweet, strawberry, grass and raspberry with a good and prolonged after taste . "
5584,6950382,"It’s tasty, light, lacks of strong sunny and earthy flavours to me."

5621,76378,"Would have been my favorite Colheita if it wasn't for the Krohn 1976, so this is a close second.. Caramel, raisins and intense fruit in the taste.. Try it!"
5622,76378,"Insanely delicious bouquet oozing from the glass. Wild mix of cream, wood, fruit, caramel, spices, nuts  and plum. Yesss!  Even better on the palate almost oily with notable fruity and plummy sensation.  Notes of plum, fig, raisin and x-mas spices. Amazingly rich and flavorful, with a long deep and delicious finish that you try to prevent from leaving your mouth with another sip; and then another...   Yess, this is what colheita is all about!!! 96"
5623,76378,"4.7 94p. Leaner than the 1980. Very complex and elegant. What a treat! Dried apricots, walnuts and oak all over the place.  Well balanced, refreshing acidity and sweetness and a long, lingering finish.  Choose 1966, 1985 or 2006, if you want to optimize QPR.  11+"

5630,76378,Drinking port with the angels ! I often think colheita more complex than vintage port. This has been in the barrel for 18 years before bottling
5631,76378,"Outstanding, I am not experienced enough to really say. However this is by far one of the best experiences I have had with ANY wine. Mind-blowing"
5632,76378,This port makes my heart sing. Forty five years--1963 to 2008 on oak. Magnificent balance. Pairs well with a 60 year old pre embargo cigar.

5693,2039720,"Really nice Douro wine. “Reserva” Portuguese wine speaks of it’s higher quality rated by the IVP and this one is of high standard.  Paired perfectly with Portuguese grilled octopus, and marinated garlic shrimp.  Can be enjoyed alone or with a slow meal. Breathing makes it even better.  Not too fruity but tasty notes of berries and even green tobacco. "

Blueberry, cassis, licorice, and light note of violet and oak on the nose.  Palate follows with blueberry and plum, minerality, and slight tobacco.  Plus acidity, medium tannin. Needs an hour of two of decanting before it opens up. Full bodied but not overpowering or overripe. Medium finish. 14% abv. Very impressive. "
5697,7199688,"Organic ❤ Blend of Touriga Nacional 35%, Mencia 35% and Sousão 30%. 14% alcohol. Vineyards at 575m altitude. 15 months on oak.   Dark purple black color. Nose and palate shows black fruit tobacco violet oak leather cherry minerals licorice pepper spices. Present acidity and tannins. Bold ripe fruity character with insane intense palate.

5713,8453535,"Dark purple red. Loads of tar and charcoal type of scents rising up initially. With some air these give way to dark plums, licorice and cocoa infused blackberries. Full bodied with marked tannins that frame the fruit in a slightly severe manner. Some tarry notes reappears in the finish along with a ripe, brooding and thick-skinned dark plum bonanza. I guess this is back to a mainstream, old fashion type of Dāo than a more recent velvety ‘Burgundian’ revelation. Feels like a too young dry Port. 13,5p"

5736,3909762,"Deep purple color. Very strong tannine smell. Wine needed to air some more but a great wooden palette with spicey hints of edium fruit, not dark red cherry.  Aftertaste ok, but dry. Nice wine and like the house a lot. "

5759,2061576,"Fresh, good acidity, mineral flavor"
5760,2061576,I had the 2016. At first opening it was a strange smell. In fact the smell might put you off. Don’t let it. Its like that horrible smell when the dishwasher needs a clean. But it tastes great. We had it with tapas and it was a really good. Give it a chance and I think it grows on you.

5765,2061576,Muito bom. A good local one from the Algarve. Nice taste of strawberries and cherries with a semi dry palate with fruity taste.
5766,2061576,Nice wine. Deep colour and a good balance between flavours.  A flavour I can only describe as 'minerality' stands out and is quite pleasant.
5767,2061576,"Strong Portuguese offering. Forest fruits, oak and hint of orange peel on the nose. Palette a bit more jammy with some balanced sweetness, followed by some sensible acidity and good medium tannins. A steal."
5768,2061576,"This is a great pice of wine :-) It smells and tastes like Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot but in reality it is made of Trincadeira, Touriga Nacional and Aragones grapes (some local varieties from Portugal). In nose - strong aroma of plum and blackberries with a touch of cherry and vanilla. In mouth- medium acidity and hight tannins with plum and cherry:-) It smells and tastes like it went through malolactic fermentation. Very recommended with meat."
5769,2061576,Really fruity nose. Sweet initially on the palette. Good density and weight. Very enjoyable

5776,4985780,"Touriga nacional here provides a unique rosé. Extremely delicate (which is surprising, given that it’s TN). Clearly 2019, rather than 2020, but still ethereal. Very slight dried herbs on the nose? Tough to describe the fruit—nectarine-ish perhaps? Keep it chilled. Goes down really easily. With a Jarlsberg spread/domestic Swiss/smoked Gouda cheese plate, but best with the Hawaiian chicken-sausage. More flavorful as the evening passes, but still very delicate. 3.9 woofs. Interesting & worth trying."
5777,4985780,"Beautiful light rosé colour, red berries and bread in nose. Fresh acidity and berries. Food friendly "

On the palate soft and round but also powerful and intense, well balanced and fresh with a long everlasting finish.​"
5796,1459609,"Red berries with some herbal nuances. Fruity and fresh style, very mild oak. Good wine - but a little spoiled and biased by a few other great Douro wines I’ve had over the past few days. "
5797,1459609,"Douro blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz.  Nose of black licorice, blueberry, menthol cigarettes, powdered hot chocolate, dark roast coffee beans.   Palate supple and smooth, the 13.5 abv has a cool freshness. Flavours of licorice, dark berry ice cream, cinnamon waffles. Soft, drying tannins but acidity lacking.

5811,1149924,"Beautiful Late Harvest from Douro Valley. It has an intense nose of green apricots but on the palate it is lacking a bit of structure and acidity, because only 50% of the grapes used to produce this wine have developed the so called noble rotten."

5829,4733343,Perfect for our tapas lunch in Sintra 
5830,7532493,"3.6 - a really interesting white Portuguese that’s well made and fun to drink. Quite fruit forward and tropical in appearance, it is nearly a little flaunting in its in your face style. Quite warm and seemingly high in alcohol but it manages to combats this with some finer layers of minerals and acidity. I enjoyed this one and I can’t help to wonder how it would age 🤔 some hints of oak but nothing too much 👍🏼 "
5831,7532493,"An intense golden yellow on glass with white flowers and fruits on nose. Some minerality, too. Medium bodied and very fresh on mouth. A great portuguese white wine."

5843,1906694,"4.1. Beautiful blend of Touriga Nacional, Alfrocheiro and Tinta Roriz. Elegant yet muscular. Beautiful aromas of viollets are complemented by dark fruit, like blueberry and black currents. Behind that,  there is crushed rocks, roasted coffe beans, hickory, musk and a hint of truffle. Complex and structured,  the palate is very floral, added by blueberry skin, graphite and cool dusty tannin. Medium, well-integrated acidity."
5844,1906694,"Nice Dão wine, from the central region of Portugal, with a traditional blend of Touriga Nacional, Alfroucheiro and Tinta-Roriz (aka Tempranillo).

Limpid clear pale straw color. Nose bringing fruits as lime and peaches as well as chalk, rounded up soil and wet grass. In mouth, wonderfull is a word than can describe it properly.

We like light mineral and zesty wines so this is definitely one of our favourite white wines."
5873,1197287,"One of the best Alvarinhos I've ever had.  The nose is dominated by chalk and minerals with grass and yellow apples in the background.  The taste consists of lime, peach and a long finish starting with tropical fruit and transforming into a mix of citrus notes.  High acidity, drink with food or well chilled. "

Deeper coloured than the others but with that tell-tale light spritz (which soon swirls away). The nose and palate align to deliver lime, grapefruit, apricot, peach, pineapple, lemon and minerals.

5886,5488869,"I’m not as enamoured with this as I was when I first tasted it.  A Blanc de noir, 20% aged in new French oak.  Red apple and green apple with a floral note.  Weighty. Something nutty about it (blanched or raw nuts) "
5887,5488869,"The little one with pale green-yellow color: Our white wine comes from Setúbal wine region in Portugal, more precise from Palmela DOC on the Setúbal Peninsula. The grape variety is Castelão or Periquita if you like better. This wine is packed with an elegant combination of apple and pear followed by mineral notes. The medium acidity surrounds the core of this wine and keeps balanced its medium body and finish. Needs more aging"
5888,5488869,Single variety Castelao. Elegant and fresh on the nose with apple and flowery notes. Palate has similar aromas with nice mineral backbone.

Fruity and slightly complex, with juicy acidity and good length. Pale straw color, mineral, orchard fruits aromas/flavors, specially peach and green apple, with notes of citrus peel, pepper and an hint of salinity. Dry and fresh, with a tasty lingering finish. Pleasant summer quafer! "
5891,5488869,"Red apple, floral, minerals"
5892,5488869,"Ah sure it's grand! Reading a bit you would expect a lot more. 100% Castelao and 20% aged in oak. Sounds interesting but really a little bland and the oak, well even that was a surprise as I didn't notice any. Must be losing my touch.."
5893,2364271,"Oak, peach strong, plum in the end, very easy to drink! Excelent! "

Portugal I ❤️you🍷🙌🏻🇵🇹  A big red bursting with personality that combines its depth of concentrated fruit (red plum, cherry, wild strawberry) with an umamic zing of acidity and beautiful paired back secondary oak spice (vanilla, coriander seed).

Very ""green"" nose of Bell pepper, spring onion, green pepper. the longer it's open the sweeter the smell becomes.  The palate adds some sweet fruits like peach and some herbal notes of rosemary and licorice wood.  It has a very soft and velvety texture for a white wine. And has a wonderful level of complexity.   This is a very nice wine to drink on its own because of the nuances in taste. But I imagine it just as well with food."
5913,1612878,"Aroma of ripe black fruit, wood notes and hints of spice. The palate follows the nose, with big and firm tannins, medium acidity, and a long and elegant finish."

Many tannins, oaky, black fruits, cherry and black chocolate. Surprisingly fruity which, hey, reminds me it's a Mencía. "
5926,76415,"This is a tannic wine that I quite like. Its tannins, while a bit strong, are quite smooth. Full bodied, dry, it has good body. Tasted at Fortaleza do Guincho, Portugal, on 9 September 2019."

After 3 hours in decanter this wine shows his true nature. Nicely balanced, medium plus acidity, fine tannins, very, very elegant wine, with velvet medium minus finish. Nice and quality wine.

5944,1308697,"Somewhere in the twilight zone, between table wine and Port wine..."
5945,1308697,"92 points - dark and inky; mineral nose of rubber and new car leather with black fruit; taste of unripened black currant and blackberries, licorice and tobacco notes. Big structure, big alcohol - a port unfortified this wine has plenty going on. Beautiful now but will age for quite some time."
5946,1308697,Very dark ruby. This is a baby and could do with another 5 years of bottle age at least. Having said that after an hour of air it became luscious. Dark ripe black plums . Spicy dark cherry. Full rich and unctuous. Sweet tannins. Surprisingly nice. Needs food. 
5947,1308697,"Surprisingly dry and tight Douro, but still aromatic, fruit driven and nicely spiced. Very nice! Cheers!"

5953,1598998,"Wow! Truly a joy in every sip. I imagine it will pair well with desserts... but who needs dessert when you’ve got this! Layers and layers of smoothly melded dried fruit flavors on top of a mellow backbone of silky tannins and perfectly balanced sweetness. From sniff to finish, this wine approaches total nirvana. Can’t wait for the 1968 release!"
5954,1598998,"N: some oaky notes, raisins, caramel, fig jam, orange peel, nutty aromas, burned sugar P: medium bodied, sweet, oily yet not too heavy structure, medium acidity, medium tannins  T: oak, raisins, caramel, cloudberries jam, hazelnut, figs, cinnamon, burned sugar F: very long, oily, elegant  Absolutely beautiful wine!"
5955,1598998,"Caramel nut brittle golden raisin dried apricot bourbon mocha deliciousness on the nose that alone is worth the price of admission. Viscous velvety mouthfeel, acidity keeping it perfectly balanced. Caramel raisiny nuttiness for days on the forever long finish. Somehow fresh and energetic after 50 yrs in cask. Bravo Taylor for creating an experience as much as a wine. Stunning. Happy happy happy 50th birthday to my sweet sweet sweet girl. xo"
5956,1598998,"Give this a sniff and be greeted by cassia bark, ash (!), razor strop leather, peppercorns (black and Cubeb) and musty old tomes, all hovering over richer notes of soppy nectarines, pancake syrup, carob, pumpkin pie, dried papaya, and even a dollop of sweet caramelized BBQ sauce.  What on earth is going here?  The wine remains powerful and layered, with a popping acidity like the ’65 but so much shimmering darkness above and below. "
5957,1598998,"Fantastic port - so rich and round, figs, walnuts, coffee. Ridiculously nice to drink, could easily kill a bottle of this"
5958,1598998,Awesome!!!!! Like drinking Xmas cake such a lovely balance 
5959,1598998,"An absolute memorable port, so rich in flavor, and on the nose the aromas are very powerful."

5963,1598998,Best Porto ever tasted!  Gift for new PR in half marathon 🏃🏻
5964,1598998,"AMAZING.  Bold nose of raisin, baking spice, figs, and jam.  Palate is much the same and lingers, but also includes chocolate and caramel.  Enjoyed with dark chocolate that emphasized the notes."
5965,1598998,"The highlight of Xmas beverages. Beautifully smooth. Despite what the label says I did decant for several hours. Walnut, fig, treacle. A magical combination with Stilton. "
5966,1598998,"Wow. This stuff is delicious. A youthful brown colouring. A combination of hay and solvent paint on the nose. Alcohol coming off like a high.   Beautiful on the palate. Soft grains, banana, hazelnuts, Madeira, whisky. Some of everything, savoury to sweet.   Incredible finish to match the concentration. So much length, sweet banana to a slight bitter nut and back  Not quite at the level of the 1965 but Delicious"
5967,1598998,"Sign of a great tawny port = green rims. Something special on the glass... Caramel, plum syrup, figs and sawdust on nose. Amazing wine, well balanced palate following the nose with long lingering finish. But to be honest, i prefer 40 year old tawny... A bit more elegant tawny with special secondary aromas."

Moderately sweet palates are nicely integrated with racy acidity to build a good balance. Very long sweet finish with jammy prune and black tea.

5988,1180569,"These ports from Quevedo were our advent calendar this year. I’m not going to try to describe each one individually - that would be far too difficult.  Basically, however, the best ones were the older single vintages. There weren’t many that I didn’t like at all and I’d buy most of them again!"
5989,1180569,"I am not a port expert but am enjoying this 2014 LBV. Dark ruby. Nose alive with deep sweet fruit with intense berry and chocolate flavours. Palate is sweet, mellow, balanced with decent length. Very enjoyable."

5998,5261703,It is soft and smooth. I find notes of honey and flowers. Its rather oaky with butter and vanilla and tropical fruit that follow. The acidity is there to balance the party though...

6008,6449030,"This wine aged 18 months in French and American oak and 12 months in the bottle. The colour is an intense closed red. The nose reveals ripe fruit aromas, a little jam and a hint of vanilla. The palate combines the good structure, furnished by its soft, velvety tannins, with forest fruits. "
6009,6449030,"70 year old goodness Cherries and berries with pepper notes on the nose that leads to a palate that's jammy and multi layered with oak, dried herbs, blackberries, pomegranates and balsamic tinges. The back is medium length with strong tannins leading to vanilla, chocolate and a smoke wisp. 70 year old vines show through."
6010,6449030,It was a bit tart
6011,6449030,"Cherry with a bit of wood. Sweet at the beginning, the maturity comes at the end and you feel it mostly on the top of your mouth. However, after swollowing it it's fresh on your mouth."
6012,1420113,"[Casa Cadaval at Prowein] Nice to try after the 2015, showing off the benefit of patience. And still no need to rush! The basic quality found in its younger sibling but more intense and rich while adding more oak and toast. Same story for the palate with leather, red fruit, wood, perfect acidity, very dry tannines and a wonderfully long finish. And still great value! 4.4"
6013,1420113,"Deep ruby red colour with dark ruby rim. Complex nose with pronounced aromas of ripe blackcurrants, blackberries, black cherry, blueberry, herbaceous, dried herbs, vanilla and oak. Dry with full-bodied and rounded well integrated tannins. In the mouth explodes aromas of ripe black fruits and licorice. Vibrant acidity with very long and overwhelming finish"
6014,1420113,"Let’s call it the miracle of time... two years of difference and this wine worked its way up to become more round, voluptuous with well integrated tannins (giving away that liquorice aroma) The work is not completely done, but we’re on schedule!🙂 4,2⭐️"

6017,1420113,"Fantastic wine! Casa Candaval produce wines since 1648. This is an authentic DOC from Tejo. Made from 50 years old vines of Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet. Dark red color with black fruit aromas and spices. Full bodied, mature and balanced tannins with a persistent finish. Very complex, my suggestion is to taste before and after decanter. Aged 16 months in new French oak barrels followed by 12 months in the bottle."
6018,1420113,"I drank it in a weekend of strong competitors , the supreme elegance was paired with Serra da Estrela cheese and ""caldo verde"" and did not loose it's stance  I recommend it . Areation is a must"

Starting on the nose from dried leaves, some leather, earthy, remembering old style fancy and expedience wines. Excellent. On the taste shows delicious tannins and strength for another few years in the bottle. "
6021,1420113,"91 points - medium dark purple; nose of black fruits, dry earth, succulents and vanilla; taste of blackberries with great balance, ample acidity and peppery finish that last very long. Good alcohol, great viscocity. Elegant with good tannic backbone."
6022,1420113,"A little too light aromas on the nose and this might be the cause of a bit leakage on the cork. Honestly, this wins has very beautiful and very deep ruby-purple color. Aromas of black fruits, vanilla, and oak. Full-bodied coupled with delicious flavors of plum, ripe black cherry, vanilla, coffee, and touch of black pepper on the palate. Dry with medium & vibrant acidity, soft but smooth tannins, and soft long length. Tannic wine & good wine to pair with beef steak. "
6023,1420113,Great wine. Love the the trincadeira combo 
6024,1420113,"like Jorre said, worth every penny.. and then some!! having had the 2005 still fresh in my mind I never expected this year to be as good as it actually is and ready for drinking. This wine competes with other wines double the price and will leave you wanting more. PQR = 5/5"

Verdict: reminds me a lot of South African red blends, but the meaty and animalistic notes are a bit more northern rhone.

6100,1605573,Thank you Paula Braga for this very good wine!
6101,1270110,"Hadn’t had Madeira in a while, and a glass of this makes me wonder why it’s not a constant companion. Terrific acidity balanced against a nutty profile. Walnut, hazelnut, apricot, almond. "
6102,1270110,"Lovely flavors of sea salt, ginger, delicate blue flowers and smashed seashells. Bright and very precise on the pleasant palate with rocking acidity. Gorgeous fruit ( apricot, dried mango, candied lemon peel) along with cut flowers and bright sea salt. Balanced and long lasting aftertaste with a savory twist of beeswax!"
6103,1270110,"Intense but crystalline brownish tea color. Slightly oxidized orange, mandarin and clementine peels. Palate is slightly syrupy, not too weighty, only slightly sweet, mostly dry, complex, some oxidized notes yet clear and transparent, long finish"
6104,1270110,"!!Unique acidity!! And that’s an understatement...  Slightly oxidative hints, cigar box, tobacco and lemon zest. Nice sugary touch in the feed but a wave of acidity is doing its best to cloud that sweet level towards the finish.  Special and unique Madeira! 4,3⭐️"
6105,1270110,"4.45/5 pours à clear, lighter amber. Scent is elegant, milder than expected, mild alcohol. Taste is powerful. Starts sweet, pronounced acidity. Very sherry like. Lovely oxidative notes. Oak. Very drinkable. Powerful finish. Lovely! "
6106,1270110,"Man is this good and the perfect pairing with a Paris Brest. Sercial is my favorite grape for Madeira (then Verdelho, then all the sweet ones). I like the acidity and depth that comes from this grape. Always a special treat and at 30 years old, a toddler, but expressive enough to start enjoying. Hope you have at least a good bottle of Madeira opened at home..."
6107,1270110,One of the best dry Madeira’s 
6108,1270110,"complex yet fresh, a true surprise."
6109,1270110,Not a huge fan of fortified or sweet wines. With that said I can appreciate what this bottle represents. Nice mix of saltiness and sweetness. 
6110,1270110,"Beautiful acidity, salty notes, dried fruit notes, apricots, citrus orange zest - a nice wine "
6111,1270110,Exclusive Sercial 1984 - Sercial is a medium sized thin skinned grape varietal which is prone to rot - ripenes late and is resistant to mildew and oidium diseases - this wine has a dry style with coffee cacao opens up with teneparature rising as it was cooled in a fridge before - sherry tones almond sweet spices like cinnamon bee wax refined bitterness. 20% alcohol. Very complex and elegant palate which has almost endless finish.   Value a la domaine 130 EUR.  
6112,1270110,"Low acidity, medium body, continuous aftertaste, some bitterness. Caramel, oak, nutty, salt, dried fruit, jam, almond, hazelnut, iron, iodine."
6113,1270110,Love the salt and caramel combo
6114,1270110,"Very good sercial from 1984. Intense, full-bodied, well integrated wood. "
6115,1270110,"Outstanding dry madeira Medium brown On the nose a savory aroma, also beeswax but not fruity Fantastic on the mouth, almond and melon notes, dry tending to medium, still a high acidity, very full bodied, opulent Almost eternal finish, oily and nutty"
6116,1136448,Very surprising. Ready to drink now and has  also the potential to mature for many years
6117,1136448,"96 dark fruits, coffee and black pepper, eucalyptus . huge. Super full bodied. warm. long finish"
6118,1136448,So good. Easy to drink now. A little bit of chocolate in the back
6119,1136448,"Eye: deep red color. Nose: Wide sweetness & young power. Mouth: Sweetness, power, gapes & plums. (Some alcohol due to young age). It need air. But so good."
6120,1136448,"Really nice and elegant Port. Fruit nose, plum, black cherry, clove. On the palate it has vanilla, honey, and cooked fruit characteristics. A really nice wine."
6121,1136448,"Almost black in appearance. Nose and palate is showing prunes, spices, vanilla, dark brown sugar, mature black fruit...🍷 complex and very very balanced. Not too sweet and not too dry and perfect tannic bite. Impressive concentration and fantastic structure. Lots of sediment so decant or be careful. Good now with no secondary aromas but it is a keeper for additional 20 years..."
6122,1136448,Bit dry and sweet. Age this one? Would like to find in a bottle shop! 
6123,1136448,"Sweet, smooth and everything you expect from Porto vintage. Worth the price. Easy to drink and with an amazing dark ruby colour.  plum oak"
6124,1136448,Tasted in 2014. Delicious portwine. Smooth and elegant. Sweet with a touch of acidity in the aftertaste. Perfect with afternoon coffee and cake :)
6125,1136448,"I love port at the end of a meal. I'm more of a tawny port  fan but this was nice ruby port, a bit thin bodied but read only good ... "
6126,1136448,"Cassis and currant, dried apricots and dark plum,  it's perfect for a nice slice of chocolate cake"
6127,1136448,"Slightly rustic, dried herb aspect to this port. A little peppery, rich, full-bodied, young. Plums, figs and blueberries. Quite soft so already approachable. Very good."
6128,1136448,Dark red color with pleasant nose of violet flowers and liquorice  liquorice carries over to the palate which is accompanied by crushed black pepper and prunes. Smooth on the palate and has a nice long aftertaste. 
6129,1136448,"Still feeling quite young. great freshness after 20 years. Round tannins, good red sweet slightly jammy red fruit. drinking very well now and can last easily for another 5. "
6130,1136448,Nice and “young “ vintage port from Portal. Nice sweetness in this 2008 vintage. 👍🍷🍷🍷🍷
6131,1183145,"Blend of 25% Touriga Nacional, 25% Merlot, 25% CS and 25% Syrah aged for 12 months in french and american oak. Pleasant nose with aromas of blackberry, black currant , plums and spices with touch of wood. Soft and elegant palate"
6132,1183145,"GOOD BLEND  Finally the winemaker pulled out a bottle that I do enjoy, their Reserva with a blend of 25% each of Tuoriga Nacional, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Quite a challenging blend I must admit.    Nose of wet leaves. I do enjoy the body this time round, good fruits, very dancing and lively, much more complexity, good length, and very drinkable. Only 6600 bottles produced yearly. Worth a shot! "
6133,1183145,"Very well structured. Excellent colour, nose and palate. Decent finish"
6134,1183145,"One hour in decanter I could smell the smell of truffles, earth from the woods after rain. Later on the smell of blackberries and herbs so pleasant to scent. The acidity dropped and brought chocolate flavours with medium low tanins and a long aftertaste of spices and tobacco. Went well with dried salamis and maturated cheese from Provence."
6135,1183145,"Easy drinking, quite floral and fruity, nice oak flavors as well. A touch of residual sugar. Short finish."
6136,1183145,"Creamy, fruity. Viognier and Chardonnay are clearly present. Long finish. Nice acidity."
6137,1183145,oak blackberry vanilla dark fruit 
6138,1183145,Nice and fruity
6139,1183145,"Touriga nacional reserva. Beautiful bouquet with scents of blueberries, black cherries , sweet red cherries, Nutmeg, clove and vanilla. It is Full bodied , dry with firm tannins and a good acidity "
6140,1183145,"Well balanced, fruity, good tannins"
6141,1183145,"Delicious, spicy dark ruby red and smooth. Gets better as you drink."
6142,1183145,Am very impressed with some of the wines from the Tejo region that I have been trying lately.    I was never a fan of the region but this is an excellent specimen.  Complex oaky Flavor deep and enjoyable.  Touches of vanilla.  Excellent balance and an appealing bouquet.   Get this wine... You will not be disappointed.
6143,1183145,"Opaque ruby red color with dominant aromas of black fruits, vanilla, and sweet tobacco on the nose. Full-bodied coupled with ripe & smooth ripe & juicy flavors of black fruits like plum, black cherry, mocha, cinnamon, and clove on the palate. Dry, medium & just right acidity, silky tannins, and medium savoury aftertaste. Soft with excellent balance of fruit intensity and acidity. Not complex but very delicious!!!"
6144,1183145,"Very well balanced wine. Matured tannins , soft and smooth. Deep colour. I have expected a better nose."
6145,1183145,"Well integrated tannins, forest fruits taste, excellent aromas. Just marvellous!"
6146,3980225,"Fun, good. Tar and cedar nose. Raspberry, black cherry and tar fruit. Tight, dry pepper and leather finish. Nice for wings and burgers."
6147,3980225,Pretty decent and got better as it went on
6148,3980225,From my point of view it’s a great wine! Surprisingly light body with full and complex taste. Very soft tannins make this wine easy to drink. But oppositely complex taste and aroma create each glass very enjoyable.
6149,3980225,"Great value here. Can we even say it’s a micro Nebbiolo ? Character was like chewing rose petal amid the dark fruit , with a nose of road tar. Touriga - Syrah blend. "
6150,3980225,"Amazing smell, like it very much!"
6151,3980225,"Dark berried fruit flavors on the nose , wild raspberries, cherry pastilles, sweet baking spice and red currant are joining too. On the palate elegant, with a pleasant freshness and tightly knitted. Fine grained tannins are noticeable on the close."
6152,3980225,"This wine NEEDS to have some time to breath. If you can appreciate a wine for its smoothness and subtle tastes, this is an interesting one. It's more earthy and dry, but doesn't exaggerate, more subtle than anything. "
6153,3980225,Nice logo. And black cherry raspberry cedar oak taste wine. 
6154,3980225,"Really great wine, very well balanced and smooth tasting (whatever that means, read it as ""I really like it"") :)"
6155,3980225,Excellent red wine which fitted with the lamb chops very well!
6156,3980225,"Another good value Portuguese red, a source that doesn’t be able to dry out! This one mixes up Syrah and Touriga Nacional.  Juicy nose with prune, black currant, black pepper and clove. The juiciness continues in the palate with again those prunes and black currant but also especially lipsmacking acidity and dry, integrated tannins. 3.7"
6157,3980225,Great Tinto. Easy afternoon drinking. Fruity. 
6158,3980225,Top Grapes Syrah / Touriga National aged in French oak barrels🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷
6159,1523548,Very good dry red wine. Got a case for a steal and have enjoyed every bottle. Looking forward to the rest.
6160,1523548,Goes well with M&Ms and Raspberry jam sandwiches.
6161,1523548,Terrific Alentejo Red!
6162,1523548,"Smooth. Spicy, black berries in flavour"
6163,1523548,"A lovely dark Portuguese in the old world style.  Great balance of acidity and vanilla’d wood, tannin, and sour fruit.  Nice minerality and dusty dryness and an overall refreshing punch.  "
6164,1523548,Always great to open a fine Portuguese wine in a Spanish restaurant in Bogota.
6165,1523548,What a wonderful world
6166,2423194,Unusual. Salt and orange. Nicely acidic. 
6167,2423194,Loved Bruma from this wine house so knew I had to try this one as well. Incredible! Slightly complex and super interesting flavor!
6168,2423194,"Fresh citrus, grapefruit, saline, slight oak, vanilla. Rather complex and long lasting finish. Interesting stuff for sure!"
6169,2423194,"Pass the 🧂 please.  Another Saline dream from the western most vineyards in Europe sitting close to the sandy ocean coast. West of Coloras  This is 💯 % Malvasia.  🇵🇹 🍇 I wanted to try.  Though I may have had a few white port / tonic and lime mixers first . Yum 😋  Nose is a bit muted ; palate though is alive and brings intensity to an odd mix of tarragon , blood orange, lime  zest and grapefruit pith  That saline character hits as it finishes. 😎  Acidity is rocking. Paired octopus 🐙 two ways.  Hello 🇵🇹 4 ⭐️ "
6170,2423194,Tried because highest rated wine on the menu according to Vivino app! Silky and smooth on the palate but complex wine with long lasting flavour. Highly recommended. 
6171,2423194,"Complex aromas of ripe fruits, honey, vanilla, orange jam and very decent saltiness at the same time.  Full body and long finish.  Above 92 points for me for sure. The interesting fact about this wine is that in DOC Colares there are still ungrafted and very old grapevines. "
6172,2423194,"Very nice white from Lisbon/Sintra!  A crisp varietal of Malvasia from the most western vineyards in Europe, facing the Atlantic Ocean, fermented in stainless steel vats, remained 5m sur lees, with battonage. Bold and complex, with juicy acidity, great depth and length. Greenish yellow color, citrus aromas/flavors, specially tangerine, floral and mineral with notes of orange zest, salinity and an hint of fruits jams. Dry with a fresh lingering finish. Very interesting white!"
6173,2423194,"The most western vineyards of Europe ! One step more and you are in ocean. Fresh and youthful. Marine nose, you know the vines got their minerality from seaside stones. Slightly salty on the back palate (or maybe the brains invents it ...). Yellow fruits, super mineral. "
6174,2423194,Fairly citrusy and acidic with a long flavor on the palate. Would pair well with something spicy or something rich as the white can cut through and make a statement that complements the food.
6175,2423194,"Very crisp, hint of saltiness. Remains smooth and very drinkable."
6176,2423194,Drank at Feitoria in Lisboa
6177,2423194,"Shiny light green with color. Light floral aromas characteristic of the caste, with citrus notes. In the mouth prevail the freshness and acidity, with notes of orange Condit.  Medium finish, with the characteristic salty sensation predominant of the Colares region."
6178,2423194,"Salty Malvasia from Colares; Casal Sta. Maria, ""The Most Western Vineyards of Europe""."
6179,2423194,Nice and tangy with clean finish.  Had with cheese and fruit marmalade 
6180,2423194,"Not bad. Well structures, complex aroma. Some apple flowers in finish"
6181,1221836,"🌍 Extremely enjoyable and drinkable Cuvée! A bit of a wine compote, but it still tastes much better than, for example, Masseria Trajone, which is favored here on Vivino PL. It shows raspberries, blackberries, cherry, lots of red fruit plus chocolate, oak and vanilla.   🇵🇱 Ekstremalnie przyjemne i pijalne Cuvée! Trochę taki winny kompot, ale i tak smakuje o wiele lepiej, niż choćby hołubione tutaj Masseria Trajone. Pokazuje maliny, jeżyny, wiśnie, dużo czerwonego owocu plus czekolada, dąb i wanilia.  3️⃣.7️⃣"
6182,1221836,"Fruity, med bodied, easy to please. "
6183,1221836,"Frutas frescas, taninos médios, bom aroma, a rolha é um mimo com a frase: Enjoy and life is too short to drink bad wine."
6184,1221836,"Easy soft nicely balanced, not amazing but it was cheap and I'd happily buy it again, but it didn't have any very strong characteristics"
6185,1221836,"Good dark colour, discreet aroma, pleasant round taste. It follows the Portuguese talent for easy food pairing . I had it with chicken lazagna. It worked well. Interesting  blend and not too long a períod of time in wood barrels ( both new and old) . More and more wineries showing up from this region. Not expensive."
6186,1221836,Fruity wine with a smidge of chocolate
6187,1221836,"Balanced, dry, not heavy"
6188,1221836,"Nice Tejo wine. Red fruit like blackberry, red currant, raspberry, peppermint, some herbals and a hint of oak. In mouth very balanced, red fruit , vanilla, well polished tannins and a delightful end."
6189,1221836,"For a Portuguese table wine this is quite nice. A bit more character and complexity that what I expected, pleasantly jammy once it settles down and the Alcoholic nose dissipates. It seems to be on sale recently at Pão de Açúcar here in Rio. It’s a great price so well worth picking up a few for casual dinners. "
6190,1221836,"Still young, but quite well balanced and excellent price quality ratio. "
6191,1221836,"Smoky, good tannin, raspberry. Great value for the price."
6192,1221836,"Aroma a especiarias e frutos vermelhos.  Um vinho agradável,  taninos suaves, aveludado. Attractive spicy ripe red berry and cherry fruit aromas. Fruity and fresh palate with soft tanines."
6193,1221836,Very nice blend. It's worth to try it. Slight bouquet with good taste. 
6194,1221836,Lovely smooth blend. Hints of fruit. 
6195,1221836,"Fiuza... One century old producer from the Tejo AOC terroir that I have mencioned here sometimes.  Tejo AOC have been delivering maybe the most modern affordable and nice reds, mixing both outoctone and international grapes.  Here Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional among others get together to express this simple but supple fresh nice red to go to your table for under USD$ 8.  MONSTER VALUE !!"
6196,4792774,"A very good, good wine. This red wine is a good reference of what Portugal does of his best. "
6197,4792774,"(4.2*) Wine Weekend 2017. Another great wine from Monte Cascas, I have to repeat that was one of the best wineries of this event. Old vineyard in altitude, field blend with more than 20 varieties and aged for 24 months in new French with 15,5% abv. Deep purple in color, very aromatic and vigorous, spices, tobacco, near black fruit of overbaking. On palate is rich with sweet tannins, much flavor, vanilla, hazelnut and coconut. Finished smooth and persistent."
6198,4792774,"Very bold wine. Medium in terms of tannins, acidity and dryness. Dried fruits with a hint of vanilla and cedar. "
6199,4792774,"Still very young, deep dark ruby with lighter borders, although from 2011. Old vines blend from high altitude vineyards in Douro. Black fruits, dried fruits especially plums, grapes, mint, cedar, vanilla, caramel, pine aromas. ‘Talks’ different in the mouth, great acidity, smooth tannins, well integrated wood, with flavours reminding red berries,  earthy, with a very pleasant spiced long and persistent ending.  Great wine to cellar and to try again in 3-5 years."
6200,4792774,Nice pairing with rabbit in restaurant Harvest in Brussels. 
6201,1195317,Sweet and medium to full bodied wine. Black fruits. Went very well (on Christmas Eve) to the traditional caramel pudding. Highly recommended!
6202,1195317,"Quick note: Black cherry, cinnamon, juicy. So sweet, raisins, red fruit, wow, opens eyes after a long dinner! "
6203,1195317,Very fruity port with tastes of dried fig being most noticeable. Smooth and also very good for such a young port. 
6204,1195317,"Tea,plum sugar, blueberry jam. Sweet but elegant. Tasted at a Portuguese wine tasting. YP94 2019.9.25"
6205,1195317,"Huge array of fruit flavors, strong acidity, long finish. Nice wine. "
6206,1195317,Dark purple in color. Oakiness on the nose. Mix of red and black berries on the tongue. Very bold and intense. A very long lasting finish that never stops. Great!
6207,1195317,Dark red with hints of purple. Freash nose of dark fruit and oak. 
6208,1195317,"Very nice complex wine with kirsch, blackberry, plum, black cherry, cinnamon tones "
6209,1195317,"Deep ruby color. Balanced, slightly sweet.  black cherry plum blueberry"
6210,1195317,New to port so nothing to benchmark against but i think this showed a nice purity of fruit.
6211,1195317,Fantastic fruity and exelence noise
6212,1195317,Just lovely with a good balance.
6213,1195317,"Aroma of black cherry, prune and dried apricots. Balanced sweet taste with light tannin aftertaste."
6214,1195317,"Very nice,  really enjoyed "
6215,1195317,Lots of ripe fruit. Mostly dark berry but I’m getting a little strawberry too. Small amount of spice but for me not enough depth 
6216,1378527,"3.5- Unusual natural pn, 30 months aging in old barriques. Almost impossible to get the varietal..really. Fresh, dusty with some marinated turkey?? meat with medical herbs hints.. red unripened berries.. herbs.. Kinda challenging... not an easy one"
6217,1378527,Very drinkable Rose.
6218,1378527,Not my best but I recommend 
6219,1378527,"Tasty, first pino I've really enjoyed"
6220,1378527,"14/20. Fresh, but dense. With blackberry jam, eucalyptus and oak. Hard to see its character. "
6221,1378527,"Disappointed! I don't mind the color for sure it is a Pinot Noir, but the mouthfeel is too soft, with a hole in the mid section and unbalanced finish, what a pity. I had high expectations..."
6222,1378527,"Red forest berries, liquorice, smoke, sechuan pepper and some nutmeg in the nose, medium body and acid, medium plus tannin, cherry, sour cherry and smoke on the palate, medium finish."
6223,1378527,"Wow, what a pinot noir. Went excellent with the beautiful food served in the restaurant of this wine maker in Porto.   Grown on the nothern side of the Douro hills, it achieved excellent ripeness in the warm temperature our the Douro region. Really worth a try, wish I could order this in the Netherlands!"
6224,1378527,"Dry, refreshing Pinot with a peppery finish"
6225,1378527,Elegance is the key word for this one. Tannins well perceived so you can keep in your celler for a couple of years. Some aging notes already there. Well done!
6226,1378527,"Oregon + Douro = great approach to Pinot noir - one dinner, six bottles!"
6227,1378527,Elegant Pinot noir - the raspberry nose gave it away but would have guessed it as Bourgogne
6228,1378527,"Fruity, easy drinking!"
6229,1378527,Very full bodied Pinot Noir.
6230,75651,"Ripe red fruit, kirsch, vanilla, peppery spices and menthol aromas. Ripe medium(+) tannins, high alcohol, medium acidity, medium body, rather short finish."
6231,75651,"Dense, dark and without any sign of the white grapes. The price is very good. The 2012 vintage was powerful still in 2019, so shelf life is quite good too."
6232,75651,"Red wine grapes mixed with a white wine grape (Bical) but tastes like a dry red wine (i.e. similar to a Rioja) with structured tannins, great QPR."
6233,75651,"Dark purple, blackberries and cherries. Spicey on the nose. Nice tannins and paired well in restaurant with marble steak."
6234,75651,Excellent wine and my second vintage of this one. Slightly on the sweet side for me. 
6235,75651,Second wine from this winery. Not as dear as the 1    Spruce nose.  vanilla plum blackberry oak ash. Nice sweet finish with creamy tannins. 4. 
6236,75651,A red wine made with some white grapes........ I'm interested in trying...  Beautiful nose of berries and some  citrus. Add some chocolate on the mouth great wine. Pretty long finish
6237,75651,"An intriguing blend of Touriga National and whitebical, intense nose, lots of texture and lively fruit, very fragrant and unique with hints of roasted nuts and spice. Perfect for braised or grilled meats."
6238,75651,Rough and tender at #tapasnascostas
6239,75651,Smooth and very drinkable right out or the bottle. Went well with spicy food and red meat 
6240,75651,"Red and white grapes in the same brew - I had no idea what to expect, but how could I resist? 10 hours in the decanter - good call - it wasn't at all nice at cork pop. This is like a classic big Bairrada wine, with a very subtle side-order of high-class apricot conserve - reasonable, but not overwhelming finish. By the end of the evening I'll know if I like it, but, so far so good. In the end I decided I didn't really like it."
6241,75651,"Excellent proposalthis Bairrada Reserve, blend of red and white grapes, 40% Baga, 40% Touriga Nacional and 20% Bical, dark fruits, flowers, mineral, bold, high acidity, high tannins, medium + finish, wine with a lot of tension!🍷🍷🇵🇹  Excelente proposta esse Bairrada Reserva, mescla de uvas tintas e branca, 40% Baga, 40% Touriga Nacional e 20% Bical, frutas negras, flores, mineral, encorpado, acidez alta, taninos altos, final médio +, vinho com muita tensão.🍷🍷🇵🇹"
6242,75651,First tried  Portugal villa 9/30/18
6243,75651,"Medium acidity, medium tannins. Black cherry, plum. Round in the mouth. Leather. "
6244,75651,"Ripe red fruit, herbs and spices, with a touch of chocolate and a hint of mushrooms and undergrowth. At the same time fresh, fruity and packing a punch.  Meat wine."
6245,3127783,"NICE BLEND   This Blanc Reserva was blended with 5 grape varieties, end result was a very decent effort, I quite enjoyed it.   Nose of almonds and soap. Palate surprised me to be a Demi-Sec wine, almost like a Ygrec from d'Yquem or G de Guiraud), moderately sweet but definitely not Bortrytis style Sauternes sweetness. Quite enjoyable and chewy. I liked it that it easily melted on the palate style. "
6246,3127783,Just enough oak for me. Complex yet fresh. .
6247,3127783,Good aroma and nice with fish
6248,3127783,Good with pecorino cheese 
6249,3127783,Wonderfully dry with an almost tartness to go song with a mineral richness. Just a hint of butteriness. Pairs fabulous with seafoods. 
6250,3127783,"Citrus dry, smooth finish  great Alvarinho"
6251,3127783,"Citrus and lemongrass, easy drinking value bottle. "
6252,3127783,Fresh fruity and such a spoil. 
6253,3127783,Soft pineapple. Lovely. 
6254,3127783,"Citrus, green apple, green pear, minerals, lime, grapefruit, medium+ acidity, slightly hazy, fermented with wild yeast."
6255,3127783,"3.7 A 🇵🇹 white blend of Rabigato, Viosinho, and Malvasia Fina.   Lemon yellow in the glass.   Spicy lime zest, white flowers, a bit of cedar closet and racey, bright acidity.   Simple and refreshing."
6256,3127783,"Firstly, I can’t believe this wine would sell at Euro 3.- as Vivino says. Secondly, I was not as convinced as many others, somehow it didn’t work for me. Maybe it was the food even though it shouldn’t be since the waiter recommended it.. 🧐"
6257,3127783,"Pale straw. Bright citrus nose. Dry, light body, high acid. The nose carries to the big citrus flavours, and a hint of vanilla on the long finish. The acid is big but reined in to a decent bright Douro wine. "
6258,3127783,"Fruity, dry, mix fruit and wood taste, good value!"
6259,3127783,"👁 clear yellow  👃🏻 citrus, pear, fresh fruity 👅 acidic but still fresh and a good mellow mouthfeel  Tasting this wine as a starter in Madeira with greate friends🍇"
6260,2646730,"Gastronomic, medium body, bone dry, velvety, jammy"
6261,2646730,"Really nice Local Wine for Lisbon. Full bodied but smooth, recommended to go with Cioba and it does."

6263,2646730,Smooth but unusual flavor for me
6264,2646730,dashits :) awesome tasty wine :)
6265,2646730,"Margarida says this is very nice and soft, easy drinking wine that goes with anything because it doesn’t have any one over-bearing flavour. It  should be a 4.3!"
6266,2646730,Black current and forest notes... interesting...
6267,2646730,"Dark ruby color, expressive young aromas with notes of ripe fruit and some toasty notes.  The palate is easy with somewhat of an aftertaste at the end. "
6268,2646730,Nice blend. Soft on the palate  Good with food. 
6269,2646730,"Deep ruby, medium+ nose of dark berries, nutmeg, cinnamon, some mushroom and wood notes.  Direct attack of deep dark blackberries, cherry and plum followed by dry spicy and earthy notes.  Medium+ acidity, high tannins, full body and long earthy finish 3.2"
6270,2646730,"Wines of Portugal, June 10 - wine fair - quick notes - good blend, 9 months in French oak barrels, balanced."

6273,2646730,"Full bodied  great finish , the nose is a little off. "
6274,2646730,"Fruity, full body. One of the top wines in my collection."
6275,2309624,This is great value. There’s green apple snd citrus and lovely petrol notes. Base mineral here as well!
6276,2309624,"Lemon, caramel, mineral notes like stone and honey on the nose. Can’t fall in love with Portuguese whites even more "
6277,2309624,"Very good wine. A lot of citrus notes, nice minerality and acidity. Douro region in Portugal is outstanding for wines."
6278,2309624,"Citrus and peach, acidic medium dry.  Great example of the viura grape. "
6279,2309624,White fruit and mineral notes. Nice texture. Lemon finish. Great product.
6280,2309624,Excellent white wine for my sea bass
6281,2309624,"A very nice clean wine with lovely subtle lemon and grapefruit flavours, great with my Trout "
6282,2309624,"Well rounded, refreshing white blend. Crisp fruit and stainless steel lead the way to a very enjoyable wine that would be great to drink on a bright patio."
6283,2309624,"Refreshing and tart green apple and lime. This interesting wine is a combination of Rabigato, Codega do Larinho, and Arinto grapes (among up to 12 others). Some floral notes. Medium body, less balance than some others. 3.6."
6284,2309624,"Good wine. Medium lemon color (2016 vintage), aromas of lemon, grapefruit, green apple.  High acidity, medium+ finish. "
6285,2309624,"Lemon, pear, citrus, pear. Really nice. Loved swordfish pomodoro and broccoli salad with pine nuts. Nob Hill $14. A winner!!"
6286,2309624,Flavors of green apples and grapefruit. Dry finish. 
6287,2309624,Light fresh fruity - loved it
6288,2309624,"Green Apple,  minerals, and lemon aroma.  Heavier mouthfeel.  Oily.  Ok finish.  Pretty darn dry.  "
6289,2309624,Ripe citrus reflected in the nose and palate. A nice mineral laced finish. 
6290,1175183,"Fantastic discovery from Portugal. Great coupage of white varieties, with lots of potential. Great oak ageing that leaves you asking for more (ageing). Nobility. A very solid 4-star with potential for more perhaps trying with more ageing in bottle.  Aromas of citrics. Apricots. Green plums. Fresh yeast. Lots of minerality. That hint of toasted caramel from the wooden barrels so typivlcal from elegant Chardonnays. In mouth, volume. Evolutive with time. From 'less' to 'more'. More Personality than Intensity. "
6291,1175183,"Fruity scent with tones of white peach, minerals and some oak and pears. Nice round palate with some sweet liquorice tones"
6292,1175183,World Class wine
6293,1175183,"This wine was nearly at the bottom in a blind lineup. And after multiple retastings I have to agree that this scoring was justified.  Medium yellow with nose of green peppers, apples, white grapes, raw oak. Medium+ mouth feel and viscosity. Medium+ finish, unbalanced and lacking integration.   Likely has potential down the road but not ready now. Would hold 2-3 years minimum. "
6294,1175183,"Clear white in colour, pear on the nose. Rich, intense, complex, minerals, sweet pear, soft lemon.  My last Grau white wine drank on a day England potentially resurrected their test reputation and my son scored 91. Really happy with this wine, the quality to cost value of the wine bought from Grau has shocked me ever time I opened a bottle.."
6295,1175183,Exciting white blend of 10+ portuguese varieties. Good complex nose and elegant creamy but fresh mouth. Liked it
6296,1175183,"A tropical nose, pineapple and mango. Palate I'd say is more green fruits. Lime. Bit of weight from the battonage. We had some slight bottle variation here at the tasting. "
6297,1175183,Enjoyed it. Nice spice. Cool label 
6298,1175183, minerals apple tropical oak
6299,1175183,"My rating is 4,1 . Cc"
6300,1175183,"On a lighter side, but mineral ant tasty"
6301,1175183,"Clear, bright light intensity with a touch of green shades. Freshly sliced green apples on the bouquet. Healthy dose of malic acid on entry. Interesting texture, perhaps some skin maceration in elements of this Douro white blend? Medium plus acid. Medium alcohol. Perhaps this will age well and soften some. "
6302,1175183,"Decent white. Medium body, medium flavour. Oakey but not overpoweringly so. "
6303,1175183,Think soft burgundy oak Chardonnay from Portugal 
6304,1175183,Dry fairly acidic taste furthermore quite sweet pear  tasting wine.  If wine is given air and swirled longer this taste becomes rather more stronger. Drunk while eating pork which combined together very well. 
6305,1988268,(92/100) Fantastic Rose.  Great gooseberries and raspberries aromas. Sublime acidity and harmony. 
6306,1988268,"[Winery visit Quinta do Monte d’Oiro 2/5] Syrah based rosé with a faint nose of red berry, raspberry and grapefruit followed by a palate with tart, pronounced acidity, pink grapefruit and lime. 3.4"
6307,1988268,"Floral with hints of rose, sour strawberry, chalky minerals and just a whiff of petrol, crisp light when chilled. Sl tangerine sour at finish. Not as elegant as Provence rose but drinkable. Ok accompanying seafood lunch ie. Prawn risotto.   At Paris Cafe, Sintra town centre"
6308,1988268,"Elegant floran scent with hints of red berries and species. Dry, with broad and long taste of Dry red fruit, a hint of pepper. Spice up the food or just enjoy with friends"
6309,1988268,"Light, fresh and slightly floral with notes of gooseberry, lemon and apricot "
6310,1988268,"Good rose with nice freshness, elegant, not like a Provence but excellent price quality (cost me 6,5€) had it with a prosciutto and fungi pizza and it was a nice pairing "
6311,1988268,"Fresh and fruity, with the smell and taste of strawberries, cherries and lime Really nice"
6312,1988268,Regular & decent 🌷

6316,1543130,"This one was part of my wine exchange with Adrienn 🇵🇹 🇷🇸 It is not my typical kind of white wine, but I like it nevertheless. It is not fresh and crispy but it is very fruity, complex, multilayered, mouthful, tropical, plenty of well integrated Alc. Enormously drinkable. Thank you Adrienn for lovely example of Lisbon White 🍷"

6321,1543130,"im rhythmus bleiben  Again in minority and even in its homeland terroir, Arinto is in fact, the key. Very classy, balanced metallic cuvée: 50% Viognier plus Marsanne and Arinto. Organic quorum within a gentle, though tense, persistent trend: Fresh, minerally contained and citric regulated. Anti-tropical. Marzipan. Crispy and constant, all along a dry, brightly measured flow. Gastronomically ready. Perfect at solo.  Very appealing, makes one think. Twice. Yes, could have saved it for a little while longer."
6322,1543130,"Creamy texture, nice acidity; dusty salt, grapefruit, walnut, pear, honey, melon peel, some brown butter."
6323,1543130,It is quite enjoyable and well-balanced - fruity in the body and palate. Good

Apricot and fresh steel into a bright fresh package.  Its fruity and touched with light vanilla toast and a bit of herbs.  Crisp clean acidity cleans the palate and leaves you wanting more.
6327,1543130,4 stars for it's value. Very nice table wine under €10
6328,1543130,Pleasant enough with mineral and tropical fruit notes. Better with food.

6346,1166848,A lovely dark pink color and fresh and fruity bouquet. A round taste of fruit and a fine dry and smooth finish with tannins. The Portuguese fish we were served had cooked in the same rosé. Delicious!

6352,1166848,Interesting rose. Kirsten loved it. Could go well with Christmas dinner. Definite notes of oak. Quite full. I was getting wine gums
6353,1166848,Pale but vibrant pink hue. Nose hits with an almost savoury young Brie note. Palate is much more mellow with a nicely acidic summer fruit nature.
6354,1166848,This was a lovely rosé wine with a lot of tase and very much flavour. Was perfect match to grilled bacalao with nice vegetables.
6355,1166848,"Now this is a good Rose! Vibrant, mineral with hints of red fruit. Pinkish salmon tint, edgy and absolutely fun. Good balance all around."

6373,2365058,Fabulously light and drinkable blush. A must with a lunchtime Mediterranean salad...or even one in the Algarve!! 
6374,2365058,So far my favorite portugal red dry wine.  Touriga National should always taste like this!
6375,2365058,Slightly disappointing. Not a lot of character. No great length or distinctive taste. Not unpleasant to drink. 
6376,1148718,"Dark complex, blueberry,blackberry, ripe fruit, herbs with smoke flavor. Mid bodied with nice tannins with chocolate bitter finish."

6380,1148718,"Another great from Portugal. Perfect for a rainy winter day in the countryside! Dark cherry, vanilla and notes of chocolate in the nose, ripe fruit and slightly oaky in the mouth, spicy and pleasant in the end"
6381,1148718,Beautiful violet color. Very earthy aroma. High acidity. Dry. Medium to full body. Quite complex. Berries and chocolate with a hint of vanilla and mushroom. Let it breathe for a while. Excellent wine for luncheon.

Touch chocolate, vanilla, toast and leather.  Softly chopped nose.  many ripe fruits.  Let it take 30 minutes to enjoy a great wine reserve."
6383,1148718,"A blend of 40% Touriga Nacional , 30% Alfroucheiro and 30% Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), which ages nine months in French oak barrels.  Clear medium ruby wine with hints of purple, showing some viscosity. Under the nose, you can find intense aromas of plum, jam and red fruits. Tasting it will confirm its fruity character ending in balsamic and spicy hints. Smooth and straightforward with a dry profile, medium acidity, medium-minus tannins and medium-minus body, fading a little too soon."
6384,1148718,"Dark fruits on the nose,  notes of tobacco and oak, dark fruits,  medium body,  medium tannins,  easy to drink"

6387,1148718,"Dark, well blended , complex with notes of berries"
6388,1148718,"Has potential, but not as good as it can be for a Reserva... expect it to have just a bit more of the woodiness/oakiness in a Reserva."
6389,1148718,"Unexpectedly good red from this producer, quite fresh & smooth. Commercial but good value, good example of easygoing Dão style"
6390,1148718,"Fruity, wood complex.Full body, tannins still present but good to drink. Long final. Nice and always a good choice for the price."
6391,76099,"2015 opened in 2020. Deep dark  red. 👃nose is strong, jam, tobacco,  mint,  wood. Mouth is strong tannins,  acidity little too much. Nose is better than Mouth."
6392,76099,"Dark ruby, very fruity, dark fruit like plum. High Tannins of not that much quality. Dry but balanced between alcohol and acidity. Full bodied and medium end."
6393,76099,"A very good wine with great balance, wonderful hints of luscious red and black fruits and a nice touch of pepper and spices.   On the nose: hints of plum, prune, cherry, blackberry and some touches of vanilla and oak. There is also a certain “greenness” to this bottle. On the palate: starts with the dark and red fruit, followed by the most dusky tones of vanilla and oak and finishes with a spicy little course pepper.   Very good wine!  Cheers!"
6394,76099,"Elegant, complex wine with deep red color with a delicate bouquet of dark fruits, blackberries, floral notes that harmoniously combine with fresh herbal tones and mineral touches.  A well-structured oak character with very delicate tannins. Good structure along with lively acidity, making this wine a wonderful example of balance and harmony.  "

6399,76099,"Ruan reckons this is the best he has tastes in Portugal so far, for the price tag at least. "
6400,76099,Needs to be drunk with food. Lots of oak cherry cinnamon apple with a dry finish and a tannic mouthfeel. 
6401,76099,Micest Dão wine had in Portugal
6402,76099,"3.3...  Simple and easy going Dao dominated by Touriga Nacional. Full of black fruit, cherry, cedar, and mineral notes. "
6403,76099,"Fruity, good value."
6404,76099,"Interesting The nose is cherries and hints of strawberries. Nothing remarkable. Palate is awash with forest floor notes mingled with oak lashings, dried herbs and wet leather. The back is exquisitely long with vanilla dipped in wood and a slight pepper smothering. One to try."
6405,76099,"Relatively full bodied, smooth, berry flavours with a hint of liquorice and a dry after taste."
6406,1169008,Portugal tasting red #16. This vintage Port has a rich palate of aromas and surprisingly amongst them is also citrus and sweet oranges. Also in taste you get this 2 flavours again making the wine more elegant. Great Port.
6407,1169008,"Had to end Thursday on a higher note and toast the upcoming weekend with the hope of a good one!  Dark and rich, heavy and thick density with aromas of molasses and fruit cake.  On the palate, sharp alcohol gives the edge to contrast the thicker, smooth texture.  Black plum and raisins, toasted caramel, baking spice, toasted sugar and the supporting aromas create the exact atmosphere I was looking for tonight.  Come to think of it, this would work on most any night!"
6408,1169008,"From the lowest altitude vines in Pintas vineyard @ around 250m asl. A Tinta Roriz & Touriga Franca-dominated field blend Port. Trodden in traditional lagares.  Deep purple.

Super rich w. liquorice, anise & clove w. blueberry jam, crème de fraise, soft med+ tannins, high alc, high acid & a long finish w. fruitcake, prune & bitter chocolate. Young yet charming."

6410,1169008,"Atomatic,  alcohol,  oak,  hearbs and spies."
6411,1169008,"Deep ruby almost black color, nose pronounced, ripe black fruits, dried herbs, dark flowers, minerals, chocolate, leather, vanilla, oak, caramel and baking spices. Mouth sweet, full body, high tannins, med+ acid and long aftertaste. It's young but will surely age so well. Very rich and ripe, great concentration of aromas and flavors, dense, powerful and solid structuted it is going to be a really great port. "
6412,1169008,"Deep ruby. Fresh and elegant. blackcurrant, prune & blackberry. Rich and full bodied with good tannins. Would definitely buy again."

6417,1169008,"(4,8) Mouth-filling and huge. This is liquid intensity. Smell of black fruits and hint of aceton. Taste of brambles, black pepper, tobacco, blackcurrant, plums, black cherries, cinnamon, vanilla, milk, chocolate, figs and chocolate mousse. Vintage port may need extensive aging, but I just love the outgoing intensity young Vintage has. @André Kerstens, 500% Wijn tasting, Amsterdam"
6418,1169008,"Dinner with confreres to share a bottle of the legendary Douro Boys, El Tranvia restaurant, August 31.  One the best vintage I’ve tasted, great!  Rate 4.5"
6419,1169008,"Very dark and cool fruit-character relying more on florality than spice for complexity at present. Some tar here also. Rich and very juicy on the palate, with plenty fine-grained tannins making themselves heard on the finish. Really stylish!"
6420,1169008,"A great port in an epic vintage, a great buy to lay low in the cellar for a couple of years to let it improve and bring more magic - great work by Sandra Tavares - great value, good deal ! "
6421,1543130,"im rhythmus bleiben  Again in minority and even in its homeland terroir, Arinto is in fact, the key. Very classy, balanced metallic cuvée: 50% Viognier plus Marsanne and Arinto. Organic quorum within a gentle, though tense, persistent trend: Fresh, minerally contained and citric regulated. Anti-tropical. Marzipan. Crispy and constant, all along a dry, brightly measured flow. Gastronomically ready. Perfect at solo.  Very appealing, makes one think. Twice. Yes, could have saved it for a little while longer."
6422,1543130,"Creamy texture, nice acidity; dusty salt, grapefruit, walnut, pear, honey, melon peel, some brown butter."
6423,1543130,It is quite enjoyable and well-balanced - fruity in the body and palate. Good
6424,1543130,Pleasant enough with mineral and tropical fruit notes. Better with food.
6425,1543130,"Good balance between fruity and acidity, middle body, fine nose. Interesting varieties for Portugal! Vioginer, arinto, marsanne, 13%"
6426,1543130,"This one was part of my wine exchange with Adrienn 🇵🇹 🇷🇸 It is not my typical kind of white wine, but I like it nevertheless. It is not fresh and crispy but it is very fruity, complex, multilayered, mouthful, tropical, plenty of well integrated Alc. Enormously drinkable. Thank you Adrienn for lovely example of Lisbon White 🍷"
6427,1543130,Good for fish but a but to alcoholic in the taste
6428,1543130,"Wine dinner at the Yeatman Oporto: Viognier, Marsanne and Arinto. No oak. Paired with Skate and Sand eel. Very fresh. Citrus. Approachable."
6429,1543130,"The appearance is clear medium straw yellow.   The nose is youthfull and aromatic with aromas of green apple, white fruit, vague pêche plat and vague raisin.  The palate is dry, medium - full bodied, crisp acidity, good balance, flavourful with flavours of apple, pleasant malic acid and a bit of Minerality. Medium finish. 13%. Gastrovino."

6431,1543130,"Precise, citrusy, fresh, nice aromatic - a simple wine for little money, a good wine to share as refreshment with friends or around sushi ☺️"
6432,1543130,4 stars for it's value. Very nice table wine under €10
6433,1543130,First wine in winebar Lisboa. Winebar cheese and bites. Very aromatic with dried flowers notes of tropical fruit and ripe citrus. The wine has good mouth feel and an elegant finish. Apricot and fresh steel into a bright fresh package.  Its fruity and touched with light vanilla toast and a bit of herbs.  Crisp clean acidity cleans the palate and leaves you wanting more.
6434,1543130,"🇵🇹 Vinho branco da região de Lisboa, no nariz fruta cítrica Lima e toranja com notas minerais, em taça uma coloração amarelo palha pálido, na boca é vivo, fresco, alguma secura, uma acidez controlada e final persistente.  🇬🇧 White wine from the region of Lisbon, in the nose citrus fruit Lima and grapefruit with mineral notes, in a pale straw yellow color, in the mouth it is alive, fresh, some dryness, a controlled acidity and a persistent finish."
6435,1543130,This wine when served too cold looses its nose.
6436,1183012,Very easy drinking summer wine. Toyed with a 3 not a 4 - it’s not a ‘wow’ but it’s also got nothing negative as such either. Supposedly these ‘green’ regional wines are a little sparkling but my bottle wasn’t. Wouldn’t have minded if it was. For a holiday wine in sunny climes I’d return. Taste notes: leading note is a fresh apple (Granny Smith) without the acidity. 
6437,1183012,"Fresh citrus, slightly sparkling full body,  for a Vinho verde quit a lot of alcohol (12%) but not dominant. "
6438,1183012,Fresh and soft vinho verde.
6439,1183012,"Good taste of apples, pears and citrus, refreshing semi dry palate."
6440,1183012,Wow green local wine! Fizzy like champagne great wine
6441,1183012,Vinho verde com cataplana de frutos do mar!!!
6442,1183012,Bought this in Madeira supermarket cost€2.99. What a bargain. It’s a semi sparkling wine no harsh taste. Nice on the tongue. 
6443,1183012,"Powerful and very nice youthful, slightly acidic and fruity aroma of mostly green apples and pears. The taste is very fresh, has an almost fizzy feeling and is just original. Albariños are always a fun tasting."
6444,1183012,Quintas do Melgaco is an award champion when vinho verde is the topic.  With so many fantastic ponctuations all its whites have impressed international media.  The vinhas velhas has recently grabbed 95 points in Decanter.  This Torre de Menagem blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura is a monster value... Costing less than USD $ 10 displayed a terrific freshness mineral/floral output in a kind of sparkling backbone.  Excellent!! Monster value for money!! 😎😎
6445,1183012,A light slightly fizzy green wine. We paid 14euros in a Portuguese restaurant. Easy to drink. No bite in the throat for after taste.. Very nice might buy a case.
6446,1183012,"Fruity , apple fresh summer wine , ideal in the Portuguese heat accompanying a mixed fish cataplana . No hint of the bingo Verde sparkle"

6448,1183012,Seco y agradable  Ok

6450,1183012,Sweet I’m only giving it 3 stars because it’s wonderful for what it is. Fizzy which I dislike. Quenching 
6451,1671895,"Very easy drinking. Mineral, grapefruit peel, and grass. Goes great with honkey-tonking country music, delicious with Caesar salad, and amazing with broccoli almond cheddar soup."
6452,1671895,"Very delicious. Flavors of melon, grapefruit and honey! Much less tart and less effervescent than I expected! Paired great with barramundi and yellow rice! Very acidic and salty minerality with tangy fruit "
6453,1671895,"Let’s round this up in the weekend spirit, ‘cause the V still don’t do quarter points! 🔢 1/4....0.25!!!!  I find this a little more serious for a VV. Slightly sweet floral honey white peach nose with pithy citrus skin. Palate has that sharpness, but it resides in the background. Nectarines, honeysuckle and an almost waxy citrus snail trail on the tongue.   Obi and out! Happy weekend you bunch of grapes! 😘"
6454,1671895,"Nice crispy wine, good kick of citrus, honey melon with earthy undertones. Went down well at a sunny picnic! 😎🌞"
6455,1671895,"Lovely colour, fab taste, doesn't have as much zip as other Vino Verde I've had in the past, but this  was much better with a good balance of flavours. "
6456,1671895,Like a really good Sauvignon without the sharpness! Went really well with spiced fish.
6457,1671895,Very tasty! Quite sweet and easy to drink

6463,1671895,"Light, crisp, exactly what you want with apres ski calamari"
6464,1671895,"Crisp and tart green apple effervescence with a mineral tang on the finish. Great summer wine. Pairs well with gazpacho, soft chews and apples or lemon chicken. "
6465,1671895,Not fizzy at all
6466,1319400,"Solid tannins but great acidity so well balanced for aging or drinking now, red fruits, blackcurrant and a liquorice edge to the nose and mid-palate. A really good food wine. "
6467,1319400,"Very smooth, refreshing and yet so full of flavours!"
6468,1319400,Very good value for money. Above average for a current table red.
6469,1319400,"None. Little sharp in the beginning, but after some time in decanter it is nice."
6470,1319400,Great table wine.
6471,1319400,"Dark, smooth and light finish"
6472,1319400,Ok but strong aftertaste
6473,1319400,"This is a powerful Douro with strong character, adstringency, red fruits. Very low value for money - the quality is comparable with other Douros in the 40-50 € range, but it costs 70 €!"
6474,1319400,Good. A touch drier then I usually like.
6475,1319400,Good for brisket pairing
6476,1319400,Soft enjoyment but expensive London bar
6477,1319400,Tasty and fruity but not anything above average
6478,1319400,"Absolutely cannot beat this wine for the $8-$10 price. I've drank many $20-$25 bottles of wine that aren't half this good. This has become our go to wine for at home ""date"" nights with gourmet pizza and one we feel good about sharing and gifting to friends. 5 stars for being best of its class."
6479,1319400,"Deep ruby color with few shades of purple rims. Pronounced aromas of blackberries, violet and raisins with touch of coffee, tobacco and cigar box. Pleasant acidity, balanced and silky tannins. Long finish "
6480,1319400,Very good value. Smooth and fruity but not too sweet or acidic.
6481,4250789,"Nice texture, mineral with high acidity. Great wine from a very small producer. Winemaker Pedro Coelho and Luis Seabra. "
6482,4250789,"Lemon, apple and earthy flavours. Lovely and easy drinking. "
6483,4250789,Great Douro material. Pared well with a fish Barrigada. 
6484,4250789,"Acid rich. Lots of lemon, lime. Dry with soft citrus tones"
6485,4250789,Not quite my taste
6486,4250789,Silky and buttery with some lime and grassy hints. Not too heavy but enough balance to make this a very enjoyable drink.  Perfect with seafood. 
6487,4250789,Dry easy wine paired to ceviche 
6488,4250789,"Pormenor branco 2015 Douro, Portugal. Good volume in the mouth, light, balanced and elegant, with citrus and elderflower beautiful drop that opened up nicely after it warmed up a touch. 🇵🇹 🤙🍷 "
6489,4250789,"Served chilled. Apple, lime, elderflower, clover honey, and a tight, chalk minerality on the finish. Medium bodied with a nice tannic grip on the finish. Balanced towards the fruit but not overwhelmingly so. "
6490,4250789,"Good white Douro blend . After two years in the cellar, this wine  gains complexity. Excellent with fish."
6491,4250789,"Very good wine, still fresh, with vibrant acidity and balanced floral and fruity aromas, with hints of butter and honey!"
6492,4250789,"Mineral slate on palate with notes of thyme. Hard to drink without food, great with strong cheese and fish."
6493,4250789,"very good wine. Pale lemon colour. Medium + nose intensity. Quite complex.  white peach, lemons, green apple, cream, flint, butter aromas and flavours. High acidity. Medium body. Medium + finish."
6494,4250789,Very nice indeed   At Taste carvoeiro £22
6495,4250789,"Good, pear notes, very smooth and definitely good bang for your buck. Very fresh and lean - a new style of Douro which I like. I expect great things to come. Slightly off dry which is why the lower review! "
6496,4683754,"Great white from Alentejo!  An aromatic blend of Alvarinho, Arinto and Antão Vaz, aged 6m in new French oak barrels and 6m in bottle, before release.  Complex, concentrated and elegant, with, great acidity and length. Yellow color with greenish hues, floral, tropical and yellow fruits aromas/flavors, specially pineapple, with notes of toast, an hint of vanilla and well integrated oak. Dry, creamy and fresh, with a tasty lingering finish. Excellent white, with great value and showing good evolution!"
6497,4683754,"Buttery and deep, intense. A perfect white to sip all year round. "
6498,4683754,"91 - good wine from alentejo. Oaky, dark ripe berries,   menthol, long finish."
6499,1659223,It worth it 3.8 Great verdelho 
6500,1659223,"Good white from the Douro, based on 73% SB + Verdelho. Pale straw colour. Nose of fresh pineapple and mango, grapefruit, spices (star anise and cardamom), green grass and limestone. Citrus driven mouth (lemon and grapefruit), minerality. Slight bitterness and chlorophyll notes in the finish. Refreshing but pretty simple and too varietal aromas."
6501,1659223,"Between 3.0 and 3.5 but not entirely convinced on the palate. An example of a good wine, with a marked influence of verdelho, but that just seems to miss something. Maybe a bit more weight to balance the acidity. But a promising wine"
6502,1659223,"Color: Greenish Yellow  Nose: Green apple, tropical fruit Enbocca: Acidic, fresh, a little carbonation, fresh cut green apple notes "
6503,1659223,Very little acidity and great flavor  
6504,1659223,Slightly soarkling but not much in it....
6505,1659223,"Bravo for this price.  My ideal summer V. Verde, not Loureiro (but it’s got 40% of it!) with not too high alc(10.5).  Rose is lovelier but love this too. "
6506,1659223,Excellent Green vino in Atyrau
6507,1659223,Very light and smootie
6508,1659223,Perfect for summer with bit of sparks at first. Full of green fruits and low percentage of alcohol. Mineral and funky
6509,1659223,"Not up to the 2016 vintage standard, but still a good value summer white. Lots of citrus, grapefruit especially. Apples, minerals also there. Slightly fizzy to start, but not overly so. 3.6."
6510,1659223,"A completely new wine for me. New sensation. Starting with the nose, you smell and immediately find the 2 casts - well balanced and well split. Beautiful straw color. Light in the taste but powerful simultaneously. A citric presence but simultaneously smooth. Two cast witch in my opinion shouldn't match but the winemaker Paulo Coutinho have find a perfect balance. Well done."
6511,1659223,"Pears, apples and citruses. Very light summer wine. "
6512,1659223,"Very good light wine, not too acidic, refreshing"

6515,3948503,"4.2: Delicious white wine.  Melon, green apple, peach, citrus, lime, lemon and soft grapefruit.  A beautiful, structured wine, great dense straw yellow body.  Smooth finish, silky, elegant, tasty and long and persistent.  Beautiful wine!"
6516,3948503,You can feel the oak and citrus notes in the nose. The mouth is full and mineral. What a great Vinho Verde. 
6517,3948503,"ES89 RP 93-94 WE90 AD92. Blend of Arinto, Azal, Donzelinho & others Portuguese white grapes from 1917 vines. 11.5% alcohol (!). 8m in reused French oak. Great partner to  sushi. More mineral than fruity & with salinity. World Wine"

6521,1163791,"(3.9) Very good wine. Alentejo never disappoints me, even if it’s not too much expensive, it’s always delicious and very well balanced. Fruity, smooth, soft tannins, medium/full bodied."
6522,1163791,"High value Alentejano. Black fruits, blackberries  with slight earthy hints on the nose.  Palate is well balanced with intense black fruits flavours.  Slight tanins. 14,5/20."
6523,1163791,"Gorgeous dry red wine. Hint of the barrel, however paves way to hits of dark berries with a punchy finish. A great Alento."
6524,1163791,Super big wine! Lots of deep jams with bold and bright red wine notes overall. Came in a 1.75L and it was shared among many with good reviews.

6526,1163791,At 14% not alcohol forward. Nice red fruits. 
6527,1163791,"Pleasant nose full of black cherries with dark chocolate and cocoa. Palate still young due to high astringent tannins, not integrated oak. Full body with significant potential."
6528,1163791,"A real dark fruity number. Like Nadal smashing a blackberry down your throat on a forehand followed swiftly by his cock. Game, Set and Match Nadal."
6529,1163791,More than expected! More than payed for!
6530,1163791,"Absolutely fabulous. Nice and light, but great berry flavor"

6534,1163791,Dry. Black berries. Slightly acid. Smooth finish. 
6535,1163791,"Simply superb for the price - better than many many more €20-30 wines and also better than the Alento Reserva (2013) that I bought for twice the price of this! Smooth, lingering finish 👍. Drink it! "

Six generations produce this field blend from 80+ year old vines in the heart of the Duoro Valliey and I loved it!  The nose is thick, dense, complex with a slight balsamic note, packed w/ black fruits, tobacco, coffee bean & tea leaf with the palate adding layers of black cherry, black plum & smoky tobacco leaf. This is one to buy again! 92 pts"

6540,1177331,"Retrieved Douro  Don't know how, I erased post and note for this wine, last saturday evening. In the heat of the tasting - 5 solid stars. Speechless, I stated something like  ""sem palavras... "", as someone may have got to read.  As I kept the original bottle, glad to be able to keep it here duly reposted.  Need to come back to this truly fabulous densely complete Douro for recap. It does deserve, even if not its top year, fact is that it carried an immensely extended retro-taste. 2 days, in my case. Saúde!"
6541,1177331,"A beauty from Portugal!! A ""field blend"" of local grapes from 80 year old vines that was a huge surprise. Served blind to my wife, she guessed Bordeaux, not far off in flavour. Needed a good 2-3 hours to really open up, and then revealed characteristics of a Bordeaux-style blend from Italy. Of course, it's all Portugal, but I haven't drank much from here and these are my reference points. Deep, dark and velvety, with layered notes of dark berry, tobacco & leather. A long finish & lovely balance. Try it out!"
6542,1177331,"A little close to previous slightly different in % of wood and just a little spicy hints.  Firm, full bodied, ripe black fruits and long finishing"

6548,1177331,"A concentrated red from the Douro, this wine presents powerfully ripe berry fruit in a silky package from nose to long finish. it evolved towards pepper after 45 minutes in the glass. Pair with rabbit stew and potatoes."
6549,1177331,"Dark red, with purpleish rim. The nose reveals fresh blueberry, gooseberry and spices. The wine is smooth, dense, with multiple layers. Tannins are present but fine. Good length. Great showing despite the youth."

6552,4270764,Lovely end of peach
6553,4270764,"91/100 Part of this wine was aged in wood for five months. The wood comes out here and adds a nice highlight to the lemon, white peach, dandelion, and mineral notes. It’s fuller in body than the standard bottling with more concentration. I bet this ages well as all the components come together. It’s delicious now, but could be a whopper with time in the bottle. "

6578,1272205,"Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: The 2015 is already really smooth and tasty, but it needs a few more years to show his full potential. Will be an outstanding wine, if opened in two or three years. (4.1 points...for now)"
6579,1272205,Full bodied soft red - black fruits and vanilla and soft tannins - just enough acidity - no great complexity or secondary characteristics but pleasant and did pair well with a lovely Portuguese lamb stew

6589,1169521,"Acidic, mealy taste similar to aged French wines"
6590,1169521,"93/100 The wines from Buçaco are old school in style, which I love. This vintage is stemmy, with raspberry, earth, and pepper notes. It’s tight and built to age with some fierce tannins. Please note that these wines become beautiful with age and this may very well shoot up in score. But right now, it needs a lot of time in the bottle."
6591,1169521,"Very rich nose, loads of freshness and pine. On mouth is full, with Living taninins showing longevity, great acidity and Very long finish. "
6592,1169521,"Far too young obviously but could not resist 'testing' it. This will definitely weather many storms. I lay you to rest now and will pop the next cork in 10 years from now. So long. We drink this in loving memory of Gert Winkler, with whom we had the privilige of spending some nice days in Portugal last October."
6593,1169521,"An interesting and complex Portuguese red blend with strong tertiary aromas. Had this at a wine pairing at a Michelin restaurant.

On the palate, the wine is dry, with med+ acidity, high tannins, med alc, full bodied, med+ intensity, and med finish. The palate matches the nose. The wine is very good, can be drank now and has potential for aging."
6594,1169521,"Hotel’s house wine. Touriga Nacional, Baga. Inter-regional blend (Dão and Bairrada). Very good vintage. Clear, deep ruby. Clean, medium intensity aroma of blackberry, plum, leather, menthol, cedar, chalk. Dry, medium plus acidity, high tannins, full body and long finish. Palate shows blackberry, vanilla, licorice. Complex, well balanced and outstanding quality. Decanter FWE. "
6595,1169521," Portugal’s cathedral of wine has started to sell their glory. Very dark hue. Sensual even, with a deeply floral nose of rose, violet, tar, brown sugar, tobacco leaf and incense spice. Soaring aromas of fleshy blackberry, dark chocolate-edged cherry, balsamic, leather, anis, incense and wood smoke. Etheral lenght. Firm tannins and perfect balance show way to another dimension. Traditional winemaking with foot treading extraction. While Bussaco Palace Hotel is fading, there’s no faded glory about this wine. "

Medium+ finish. Very good."

6694,1177331,"Berry compote, dark chocolate, spice and a long finish. Fading, but still powerful."
6695,1177331,"Caramel, blueberry and blackberry with a bit of cedar box on the nose. Fresh and lively on the palate, dried raspberry. Tannic and well balanced acidity. Complex. "
6696,1177331,"4.8  Tasting notes: Colour: Dense purple.    Aromas: Dens, extremely powerful and concentrated of ripe fruits, packed with blackberries, black figs, black plum, damson fruit and balsamic oak notes and a tight character recalling schist soil and herbs.   Taste: It has a tight character and a huge powerhouse develops on the palate of an explosive and very concentrated fruit of cherry and blackberry, with balsamic oak, tobacco, leather, herbs and cardamom, recalling schist soil with mineral notes. ⤵️  "
6697,2545450,"This is a not retouching wine! It is perfect! It presented a lot of forest fruit and prune aromas and a fantastic and intense nuts, dark chocolate and wood flavors! It has full and powerful body!"
6698,2545450,"Old school, Top notch, cult wijn uit de Alentejo"
6699,2545450,"This iconic red from Fundacao Eugenio de Almeida - Cartuxa is side by side with Barca Velha as best known reds from Portugal.  Legend says that was wine brought by Pedro Alvarez Cabral in his fleet to discover Brasil.  Legends apart, this is a beautifull fullbodied accid and tannic red that needs at least 3 hours decant to let emerge all his qualities. But then, you will kneel before it. Unfortunately most people rush to open and drink too young ones.   A red for adults!!"
6700,2545450,"An iconic Portugese wine. Dark, slightly turbid red. Fruits in the nose is just felt among some funky aromas of some baked veggies and moderately medicinal aromas. Palate is very mature, soft but persistent and balanced with cherries and cornelian cherries carried by a nice acidity and soft tannins. Smooth and mature."

6713,8967,"My rating is 4,3 . Cc"
6714,8967,"Wow, this one was really special.  Details later..."
6715,8967,"Good wine in a hot year, port style,long and complex"
6716,8967,The last day of 2017 with the best Douro wine tasted this year. A almost 15 years harvest of Batuta. 
6717,8967,"Black fruit, incty, still some tannins left, but very nice integration. Smooth as well. Great with red meats. Can go for some years easily. "
6718,8967,"Old vines >70 years, red fruit, chocolate, spices. Fine tannins and fantastic balance and long aftertaste. An elegant, complex wine."
6719,8967,"Very mineral, fine, dense red  wine. Strawberry jam and black cherry jam, earthy, black wet stone aromas. Fine, dense, velvety tannins. Well balanced minerality, tannins, fruitiness and moderate alcohol. Fine premium quality wine."
6720,8967,"Brilliant Douro red! 18 years haven’t impaired the strength of this great wine, just exalted and polished its character. With a traditional blend, this a classic red from Douro and for long a top reference of D. Niepoort wines. Rich, fresh and well balanced wine, still with perfect acidity and length. Ruby color with golden hues, mineral, plums and wild  berries, with earth and resin notes. Medium bodied, silky tannins and lively acidity providing a long fresh finish. Very gastronomic (12.5% alc)! Awesome! "
6721,8967,"Appearance: light red  Nose: perfumed nose with scents of forest fruits and baking spices  Palate: full bodied wine , moderate acidity , firm tannins showing red berries, red cherries, vanilla and clove Long finish "
6722,8967,"I’ve recently rated Niepoort’s Redoma; this is the big brother. 70-100 year old Douro vines from two sites, mostly on north-facing slopes to ensure slow ripening. A field blend, with Touriga Franca the biggest component. Gentle extraction, 20m in French oak, 25% new. It’s similar to the Redoma but with more depth and intensity. Dark berries and gentle oak spice, elegant and mineral. Medium + tannins and acidity. Only 12.5% abv. Remarkably drinkable now, but will of course reward patience."
6723,8967,"This bottle was Wine Of The Night. It was really singing. So many layers, so alive and intense. Everyone a the table loved it.   Spice, smoked meat, plums and dark berries. Good structure and has many years left. Smooth finish. Highly recommended! "
6724,8967,"Very intense fruity, plum scent on the nose, beautifully complex, with big velvety tannins. Nose reminds of a port wine, without the sweetness. Great, powerful wine that is very easy to drink."
6725,8967,"Nice portugese wine. Medium body, leather and blackberry on the nose. Palate is filled with dark fruits, oak, vanilla and raspberry flavors.  "
6726,8967,"12 years. Dark, Complex nose. Good structure, black fruit, pine, freshness. Thin tannins and very long finish. Very very elegant. "

6728,1497327,"4.5 excellent wine from dao portugal. A lot of black fruits, blackberry, plum, blackcurrant a lot of vanilla notes. Nice quite long finish."
6729,1497327,Black fruit and cherry aromas with light vanilla aromas and liquorice on the palate. A very balanced body... Needs to breath for a couple of hours. This is a very good wine from the Dao region.  
6730,1497327,"Still perfect. Deep and fruity wine, it could be aging in bottle more than 10 years. "
6731,1497327,"Historic catch up notes from the archive for personal reference. A field blend from the Esmoitada vineyard of 30+ varieties, notably Touriga Nacional, Jaen, Tinta Roriz, Rufete, Alfrocheiro etc. 80yo vines.  Deep purple.

6734,1497327,Very good. Very balanced and drinkable. Full of caracther and minerality. Will last a long time but it's drinking superbly well now. It's one of those wines that needs a few minutes to clean up on the nose and then... Wow.
6735,1497327,"This is a remarkable old vines blend , it seems like a fine Burgundy , something with finesse , focus and gorgeous craftsmanship. With a fine floral nose and in the mouth a swirl of ripe boysenberry fruit, moist forest floor, red cherry preserves and notions of pine needles. There’s even an edge of vanilla sugar to its corpulent , baked raspberry fruit supported by fine grained tannins. It is a superlative effort in every respect , brilliantly balanced and full of personality. This has a great longevity !! "
6736,1497327,"Intense and expresive aromas of black fruits, prunes, blackcurrant involved with fresh aromas of oak, vanilla, cigar box and chocolate. Well integrated tannins, pleasant acidity, good structure and medium long finish"

6742,2183165,A very nice portoguise red full-bodied but still quite smooth and soft - would have rated it 3.5 stars but it deserves the last half star due to its very good value for money. 
6743,2183165,"90/100 A blend I will have to look up later. Fantastic wine at this price. Notes of chocolate, dark red cherry, ripe strawberry, and pepper. It smells dark and dense but feels light on the palate. Chewy tannins and a good finish. Solid wine under 10 euros."

6746,2183165,"3.9 This is a big, full wine that needs some food and a bit of time in a decanter. Deep ruby in the glass.  Bold aromas of dark chocolate, smoked meat, baking spice, gingerbread and a core of ripe plum and black cherry.  Full bodied with fine grained and chewy tannins with ever present acidity.  Flavours match the nose with sweet black fruit, gingerbread and baking spice.   Excellent length.   Drink 2022 to 2026+. "
6747,2183165,"Well today it's the 46th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, so a Portuguese wine was in order. This took a while for any smell to become apparent. Black cherry, blackcurrant, big hefty body. Tar licorice. Now to finish it off with some cheese. "
6748,2183165,"What a great find! Dark purple with deep blackcurrant, tar and a hint of smoked meat on the nose. But then you try it and it’s lighter than it expected, full of flavour and silky. Paired with beef wellington at Kinship HK. "
6749,2183165,"Fruity wine, blend of usual 3 varieties for this winery. Blackberry nose , with some tertiary notes of tobacco and wet forrest floor. Palate is quite tannic and acidic ( a tad off balance), medium + alcohol, medium acidity. Long finish, not as pleasant as 6033 or reserva, but interesting. Pepper,  plum and some dark chocolate.  Persistent and food demanding wine. "
6750,2183165,"Syrah blended with Alicante Bouschet, Aragonês and TN aged for 9 months in still tanks and oak.  Deep ruby color, fresh red fruits and spices, medium bodied, elegant, mouthwatering tannins and fresh medium finish.  Personal project of David Baverstock, Esporão winemaker.  Rate 3.8"
6751,2183165,"Great value for this price point.  Smells deep and dark with some spice to go with the black fruit.  The palate surprises. Full bodied but approachable, nicely balanced and rich.  Black cherry and something savory. A little heat from the alcohol, but a good finish. Nice"
6752,2183165,"Ok, So i should be rating this 5 stars ...you know...for the name🤣🤣...but it's still lovely.  A really pleasant and elegant wine. Ripe red cherry, plum and dark fruit. Hints of pepper and sandalwood. Fine tannins with lively acidity. Full bodied  A really fun wine to drink"

6756,2183165,Nice and dark. Blackberry and plum. Pretty smooth and leans more towards full bodied. 
6757,1216147,This wine is fruity with lemon and melon notes. It was aged in wood that has given a ripe lightly toasty character to the wine along with its cool crispness.

6761,1216147,A superb white. New to me and bought in Macao. Super light combination of Asian fruits pineapple butter smoke lychee. Long finish and super food wine. Very good balance of acidity and fruit. 
6762,1216147,"This is quite a good wine. Young but Balanced,  maybe acidity is a bit in the front,  but not artificially so. Distinct minerality, maybe a bit high outtake of grapes?"
6763,1216147,"You know when sometimes you rea a back label and you think, yep this is the one. Your taste buds are already tingling at the varieties describes and the oak and the maturation. Then, you get it home, put it in the fridge if required and then the moment arrives. The cork pops and your in. But, while all the constituent parts are there, the fruit, the oak the late harvest, the whole does not equate to the sum of the parts. That is where I am here. Fruit? Yep. Oak? Yep. Good? Yep. Delicious? Nearly...."
6764,1216147,"Blend of Siria, Verdelho, Arinto & Viognier from Alentejano. Not an outperformer but solid for small money. Partially fermented and aged in oak.  Nose of apricot and dried fruit. Rich palate of nuts, flowers and ripe peaches. Well integrated acidity.   Nice drinking without thinking 😋 "
6765,1216147,"Very decent white Alentejo! It has decent hints of herbs and aromatic spices as well as ripe citrus fruits. On the nose: hints of blossom, fennel, grass, wheat stalks and ever so slightly, granny smith apples. On the palate: quite light, fresh, crisp from the granny smith acidity and a little dense from the herbs and spices. Cheers!"

6785,1413546,One of my favorite douro winemakers 
6786,1686456,"Escolha Branco comprises 60/30/10 Avesso/Chardonnay/field blend. Unoaked, this takes the VR Minho badge instead of DOC Vinho Verde owing to the Chardonnay.  Pale lemon.

6793,1686456,Still quite fresh despite its vintage. Good acidity. Very present oxidation.
6794,1686456,"Tasted at Covela's historic estate—a Renaissance manor that sits frozen in time, poised at the mouth of the Douro Valley, along a southern-facing amphitheater robed in lush greenery. The 2013 Escolha Branco is a blend of Avesso and Chardonnay, with a few years of age, offers perfumy aromas of dried honey and orange blossom. Barrel fermentation lends texture, refinement and creaminess. This is a balanced, poetic wine, bright and fresh with delicate mineral filaments wending in and out of stone fruit. Sample"
6795,1686456,"Very nice. Dence, mineral. Long, impressive finish."
6796,1686456,"Covela Escolha is a blend full of character made of Avesso and Chardonnay. On the nose, you will notice lifted vivid floral notes followed by aromatic tropical fruit. The creamy attack, balanced acidity, excellent mouth aroma which finishes with a medium and refreshing finish, builds a medium body of this wine. It is good wine made by Rui Cunha... definitely worth trying"
6797,1686456,"Blend combines Chardonnay and Avasso. Nice fruity and herbal notes on the nose. Pronounced acids on the palate. Aromas include citrus, flinty mineral combined with creamy feel in aftertaste. "

6806,1973752,Fresh citrus nose with good bubbles and a somewhat semi dry sweet finish. It’s actually the Murganheira Vintage 2011. Pairs well with oysters and most seafood. Also a great aperitif
6807,1973752,"Epic 2021-06-11 PN night with VV LT crew.  1st full post quarantine gathering.  Palate cleanser No#2 before starting PN blind tasting.

6809,1973752,"VVLT, PN night, opening bubbles. If I am not mistaken, that's my first Portuguese bubbles to taste and luckily one of the better ones. Wild strawberries, brioche, chalk, grapefruit skin. Intense, yeasty palate. Well balanced acidity, dry finish with a slight bitter note. Strong 4."
6810,1973752,"Blind session tributed to Pinor Noir (meeting of Vivino LT friends) - evening opener #2. My 5th bubbly from Murganheira, varietal PN, 2011 vintage now.  L: Bright yellow with pinky copper hues, not intense but fine bubbles at abv.13.5. Pretty shy though subtle N:  strawberry, flint, buttery, flowery, citrusy notes. P: rocky mineral & buttery, moderate though zesty acidity, strawberry & lingonberry dry mid-way, persistent grapefruit finish.  Very gastronomic fizz though pleasant sipper. Still for cellaring. "

6813,1973752,"Nice brut espumante with small bubbles and light colour. The flavours was the same, somewhat to light though and a lack of bread for a higher rate.   (Dracks i Portugal på golfresa 2018)"
6814,1973752,Enjoyed in Portugal with suckling pig. Light and a typical Portuguese blend.
6815,1973752,Very nice but missing some bubbles. 
6816,1393914,Tasted from a half bottle
6817,1393914,"Fruit cake, Five spice powder on a long broad opulently structured flow of dark fruit.black boy plums,  and a grippy dusty smoke laden under carriage.So long and thats after a month open.Delicous infanticide."
6818,1393914,"Last two from Ramos Pinto. This is a single Quinta vintage port from Ervamoira, the same site that Ramos Pinto use to produce their 10 year old tawny. Really young and violaceous, even more obviously so than Ramos Pinto's 2014 LBV. Very much in the producer's elegant and balanced style. Ripe red fruit, plum and cherry, with spice, tar, chocolate, liquorice. A lot of concentration and finesse, this is priced at almost the same level as Ramos Pinto's declared vintage years, and I now understand why. Keep. "
6819,1393914,"4.3 for this amazing dark ruby port, with plenty of coffee, chocolate, mature fruits with a good balance and structure and a great long lenght."
6820,1393914,"Well balanced, perfectly sweet. Blackberries and blueberries are killing "
6821,1393914,"90p. Ramos Pinto #2. The '05 Vintage Port was bottled in '07. A premature opening of the bottle! 👁 Tight dark red, almost purple. 👃 Deep fruit, somehow closed at this stage. Canned dark cherries & plums, mixed with dried fruit. Synthetic note of wood varnish. Sweet tobacco.  Rather sharp alcohol sensation. 👅 Intense & complex; rich fruit. Convincing mouthful. Long-lasting, slightly bitter, finish. 🎯 Fine Vintage Port, but not yet fully developed. Potential for more, save it 5-10y or more!"
6822,1393914,No notes taken.
6823,1393914," red fruit plum black fruit Fruktig,"
6824,1393914,"This is exactly what I expect from a port wine. Extremely balanced and smooth. Acidity and sweetness perfectly in tune, delivering beautiful hints of raisins, confited berries and pomegranate molasses, a timid note of coffee closing. Outstanding!"
6825,1393914,"Blackberry, raisin, blackcurrant, chocolate, red cherry on the nose. M+ body. Medium tannins. Blackberry, blackcurrant, raisin and vanilla on the palate."
6826,1393914,"Decanted for over an hour... wow. The flavours in here are ridiculous. Hidden away since '94, it's something special. Plum, blackberry, jam, and some spice - very warming. One of the classical years, apparently!"
6827,1393914,"Good vintage Port, fruity, high tannins but well integrated, aromas of dried grapes, dried prunes, red fruit, oak . Long finish. 3.4"
6828,1393914,Call it a 4.3 night dark colour with a violet rim. Herbal notes on the nose with brine and a farmyard tang developing. Smoother and lighter than the lbv with a very long finish. Fig and raisin notes up front with a cranberry hit on the finish.
6829,1393914,"Deep burgundy color, smells of blackberry, blueberry, India ink and graphite, full body with round mouthfeel, tastes of dried fig, dried persimmon, current, Thompson raisin, cigar box and dark chocolate, complex and long finish, quite sweet but oh so yummy, hitting its sweet spot now!"
6830,1393914,"Probably my best experience with a Port. Shared with friends (with the distancing measures), we succeeded with the rule for Vintage Ports of ""the bottle shall not touch the table once opened"". Incredibly smooth. Full in flavours and with different tastes and nuances but not intense nor liqurous.  Aromas of fresh red forest fruits. Orange peel. All sorts of nuts: raw, toasted and caramelised. Cocoa, chocolate, toffee, coffee. Vanilla. Honeys. In mouth, pure delicacy. Thin velvet, almost silk. Equilibrium."
6831,2258813,"Excellent port. Pale red-brown color. Perfect balance with smooth and round tannins. Palate shows raisin, caramel, oak, dried fruit and nutty."
6832,2258813,"I'm falling for Dalva every year more and more. Alcohol in good balance with fruit, the wine is still very nice and fresh and no way old or out of year. excellent!  Almonds in alcohol, chocolate, biscuit, mint and dark chocolate with cherry, raisins and honey. Fig with dried cherry and dried apricot."

6834,2258813,"First time with this house. Excellent flavour for a ~20 year colheita. Citrus hints. Interesting colour, almost orange."
6835,2258813,Fruity and smooth. A very good port wine for value.
6836,2258813,Awesome port. Tried it together with the 1991 vintage and this 1990 is the best. Nose of plums and prune. Body of dark berries and honey.
6837,2258813,"Very citrusy profile, another rich style port, intense with dried orange notes, lingering acidity and spicy character - a lovely texture #portwineday #winelover"
6838,2258813,"Complexity yes, but a excess of acidity, difficult to drink "
6839,2258813,Oye vey what a treat a gift after dinner I suspect many glasses considering the giftee. That said fig Carmel rain a tad of coffee/chocolate and smoked walnuts
6840,2258813,Foot aldersbleget larked fylde krydrede peebernoter never jammy Lang blowed eftersmag
6841,2258813,"Wauw! Incredible. Harvest in 1990 and bottled last year - how’s that even possible for this to end up like this?? What a golden / amber colour!   Nose: Raisin, caramel, oak, chocolate, nuts (almonds), burned bread, honey and tobacco (smoke). Palette: Sweet and rich. Still a pleasent amount of acidity. A beautiful longevity.   One more glass/bottle please!"
6842,2258813,"Brown dusty color. Nose is prune, plum and hints of coffee. Mouth is very full with prune, plum, prominent caramel, coffee and vanilla. Aired it for 4 hours before drinking. A great glass! Power without tannins, just so much taste. "
6843,2258813,"A final review from Portugal, a gorgeous 1985 Colheita field blend tawny.  Pale brown. Pronounced aroma intensity, very nutty w. concentrated walnut, hazelnut, dried apple, raisin & sultana. Fig w. wood spice, cinnamon, coffee & tobacco. Fully developed.  Sweet. Very rich & concentrated, complex w. bitter chocolate, raisin, sultana, dried fig, walnut, vanilla & buttercream. High alc, high acid & a very long finish w. low tannins, cocoa, cinnamon & toasted hazelnut. Outstanding!"
6844,2258813,"Red-brown colour. Nice sweet dried fruity nose. Dates, figs, dried apricot and raisins. Lovely balanced. Nice vanilla flavours. Soft mouthfeel yet grippy. Good stuff. DALVA MEETS STAR WARS by the way."
6845,2258813,"Colheita on the other side, means that the grape used to produce the port are all from the same vintage. It also needs a longer barrel ageing process to deserve the appellation.   Stronger and deeper than LBV, the robe is also thicker, and darker. Caramel, coffee, oak and cherries are the most eminent flavours this port wine offers."
6846,2322876,Love this winery 
6847,2322876,Plum and dark fruit some Vanilla. Really good value 
6848,2322876,"Excellent pairing with filet mignon. Fruit forward on the nose with a nice full body dryer, medium tannin taste"
6849,2322876,Lovely dark fruit flavours with some vanilla from oak. Full bodied & lovely and smooth. We had it with venison which was a good match 
6850,2322876,"Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Alicante Bouschet grapes. Black plums,  damsons and some balsamic on the nose. Continues on the palate with some sweet leather notes and some oak and associated vanilla. Grippy tannins, medium to high acid balancing well with the alcohol which at 14.5% isn't particularly apparent."
6851,2322876,Good wine! Very well with veal ribs in almost spring lunch in fm family. Wine from my last visit to the winery.. 
6852,2322876,"Very drinkable. Lots of stickers infer a bit of recognition, but it's basically a really nice Shiraz with a soft tone."
6853,2322876,Intense ruby color. Wild berry aromas with hints of balsamic and tobacco leaves.
6854,2322876,Balanced taste with longish finish. Give it time to open up.
6855,2322876,Lovely full body wine goes well with red meat and string cheeses!
6856,2322876,"Deep bodied wine, fruity and full of flavour."
6857,2322876,"Complex wine around the forest fruits flavour, silky tannins. Great with food!"

6859,2322876,Very dry. Thought it would open up more after a day or two but not really. Still decent. 
6860,2322876,"Floral, fruity, full of flavors. Medium tannins."
6861,4441946,"tasted in the restaurant this Douro opens nicely with hints of black berries, salt and licorice. Well bodied and harmonious it went well with the roasted octopus. "
6862,4441946,"Elegant,  velvety,  smooth. "
6863,4441946,Wanted to have some frutier wine to my roasted octopus and my girls vegan curry so we went for this one. Cherry blackberry and other mostly red fruit notes with little addition of oak and licorice. Very smooth and very well matched the food.
6864,4441946,"A good proposition for the price,nice dark ruby color and a very fruity and floral nose.A body of medium intensity balanced with firm tannins and enjoyable acidity.A fruity and fresh mouth with medium persistence!Not bad at all."
6865,4441946,"Fruity and light, great aroma"
6866,4441946,"Thick red with violet hue and fat legs. Spicy medium lenght, black fruit and touch of vanilla."
6867,4441946,Drinkable medium bodied 
6868,4441946,Medium body. Juicy. Flint.

6877,4989151,"Great PQR white from the Beira region. A bit muted on the nose, but showing beautiful acidity and minerality on the palate, dry with a light bodied profile with citrus and pineapple driven flavors. 3.8⭐️"
6878,4989151,"3,9⭐ Really nice white from B. Interior, with an interesting blend. 🍇Síria, Fonte Cal. 👀Vivid yellow. Scarse, blurry and fast tears. 👃Intense with lime, grapefruit, tropical fruit and minerals. 👅Light-medium body, dry and medium-high acidity. 🏁Short-medium finish with the minerals dominating the aftertaste. 🗒️Good PQR and at least this time got the order right and closed the night with the best one.😁"
6879,4989151,"🌟🌟🌟🌟, PnP. Worcester wine festival grand tasting. Clear in color with a light delicate viscosity. On the nose aromas of citrus, lemon and apple. On the palate dry, crisp acidic and bolder than expected. Flavors of citrus, lemon, minerals and salinity. Medium refreshing finish. For about $15 it has a very good QPR.  SALUTE' !!! 🥂"
6880,4989151,"Bright and crisp, some minerality. Clean finish."
6881,4989151,As the name says.. Quartz is the soil that the wine was planted on.  Mineral driven and well balanced. The wine was only 6months in steeltanks and therefor is pretty fresh. The additional year in the bottle made it quiet round and gave the wine a good drinking flow.  Medium body with a integrated acidity.  Mire floral than fruity and with a mineral underlining.  Did fit perfectly wirh our seabass tartare. 
6882,4989151,"Pale straw in colour. Light in body, primarily citrus. Grapefruit on the nose but more tangerine on the palate. Nice zingy follow up."
6883,4989151,"Medium body, fresh and dry. Citrus, grapefruit, passion fruit, and honey aromas. Great with seafood"
6884,4989151,At the Wines of Portugal annual tasting with @[1|4684559|Janne W.]
6885,4989151,"A serious wine for the price. Less aromatic and floral on the nose than the standard Beyra branco, this wine is more mineral and complex while at the same time being weightier both in texture and flavour. Quite broad in the mouth but with a piquant, salty, mineral finish. I wouldn’t chill this wine too much and think probably it would benefit from some ageing. Overall very good. "
6886,4989151,"The BEIRA Kicks.   Absolute 2ndTake (07.X.017). Same wine, same year. And that is good.  No regrets, no complaints, and basically no doubts.  However, repeat the good is another word for pleasure.  And I am happy to say, my Friends, it is it.   A lot of nostalgia remained from previous meeting, and a lot of Saudade just quenched. Fantastic mineral fluid from the Portuguese bold hinterland. Brave wine. Brave the ones who brought this to our table. That is, in the end of the day, wine's ultimate mission. Yes."
6887,4989151,"Very fresh, citrus, green apple, acid rich"
6888,4989151,"3.8 - timeout market. Sweet nose - honey toffee. Apple, grapefruit."
6889,4989151,"Lovely wine, the first feeling is minerality then the acidity of a green apple the finish is a warm tropical fruit. It isnt a light easy white wine, but a slightly complex white. Dont be fouled by the first sip.."
6890,4989151,"Light coloured. Great bouquet with notes of pineapple, mango and flowers. Fruity on the mouth, but a bit too sweet for my taste. Medium aftertaste. Interesting but not exactly my kind of wine (maybe I didn’t choose the right pairing) "
6891,1605573,Typical Sauvignon blend Enjoyed Would drink again  On the dry side of Sauvignon 
6892,1605573,Tropical. Maracujá e frescura intensa com mel no final
6893,1605573,"With Sauvignon blanc, dry, acid, fresh with lemon."

6895,1605573,New Year’s Day in Funchal lovely
6896,1605573,"A blend between chardonnay, Sav Blanc and Maria Gomes grapes that works well. Fresh and lightness from the Sav Blanc. Body and structure from Maria Gomes. Chardonnay is cements the two with some acidity. Like it!"
6897,1605573,Exhuberant aromas from Sauvignon Blanc. With good structure from Maria Gomes (Fernão Pires).
6898,1605573,"My rating 3,7 . Cc"
6899,1605573,"Correct, easy drinking everyday white, good value. Not particularly complex or different. Some slight saltiness on the nose, citric, short length "
6900,1605573,"seco, mineral, encorpado"
6901,1605573,Smooth but still bright. 
6902,1605573,Fruity aroma. In the mouth it feels high acidity with soft minerality. middle final It remains a safe value
6903,1605573,Minerals. Grapes. Ok  but not more.

6907,1396747,Fresh and fruity. 
6908,1396747,"Citrus and floral hints, lime and peach, fresh and mineral aroma. Fresh on the palate, vibrant and fruity with medium finish. Serve with grilled fish, pastas, pizzas."
6909,1396747,"Rubbery, peachy nose. Thin but expansive mouthfeel, peach is there along with notes of postal stamp glue - surprisingly mineralic. Easy and refreshing!"
6910,1396747,"Have to agree this is a great QPR but as with so many wines in Portugal if you buy local. Typical off-yellow tinge, fresh and vibrant on the palette with little drips of golden syrup balancing the even citrus. Gets deeper the more you taste. "
6911,1396747,"On first sip I felt the wine was harsh and too acidic but then a plate of Portuguese cheeses arrived and, voila, the wine transformed. Fruity, medium body, dry and easy drinking on a lazy afternoon in the Lisbon sunshine  peach stone stone stone fruit citrus"
6912,1396747,"A complex and extremely rich nose, a mix of orange and peach but with a sour aroma. The body is bold and mouthful, with mineral tones and acidic. "
6913,1396747,"With a color of pale yellow and green, the nose has notes of citrus, melon, tropical fruit, apple and pear. The palate is surprisingly tart. The palate has notes of tart apple, lemon, lime, young melon, and even gooseberry. There's some minerality and acidity that cut right through. "
6914,1396747,"Portuguese cork. Simpler label art than on the reserve version. Green translucent color, soft minerality signs, fast to middle legs. Decent nose, bread dough, dried fruits. Decent palate, medium acidity, some savory - especially on the back, bitter finishing and aftertaste. Decent entrance wine, hard to rate just after drinking the reserve version."
6915,1396747,"(85/100) An entry level from Rui Reboredo Madeira. Ideal for sushi and light meals. Drinked @ Mizu in Maia.  🍇 Roupeiro, Rabigato, Viosinho  👃Citric fruit, pear  👅 Fresh, mineral and fruity in a good way.  Medium/high acidity with clean and short finish.  Good price quality ratio. "
6916,1396747,"3.7 stars. Pale in color with some green and yellow hues. Nose of mineral, river rock, chalk, citrus, and green stone fruit. Medium plus acidity. Mineral driven body with lemon, green apple, pear and lime. Chalky limestone on the finish. "
6917,1396747,Intense flavor of green fruits. In the mouth is balanced and slightly sweet. Good finish. Very interesting wine for the price. 
6918,1396747,"Mineral aromas with hints of white fruit and citrins. Voluptuous, fresh, with good acidity which make it an excellent wine for its price level."
6919,1396747,"Pale gold. Intense peach and floral aromas on the nose. Medium body, medium alcohol and acidity. Nice apple, melon and stone fruit flavors on the palate with a long finish. "
6920,1396747,79/100.... Cheers. Very nice white at affordable price. 
6921,7562740,"A delicate and fine wine.  I got green fruits, herbaceous, lite fresh lime and a touch of peach in aromas.  Fresh and clear flavours showing white floral, green fruits with a a fairly short length leaving a faint green zestiness."
6922,7562740,"Frutos secos, boa estrutura. Final de boca longuíssimo. Top!"
6923,7562740,"(3.8) New vintage 2018, still in the game, less powerful but still creamy, oak aged 8 months, needs breathing and not to be over chilled.  Medium dense,  creamy on the palate,  releases flavours of ripen citrus, stone fruit, minerals, toffee and some bitter notes.   Creamy finish with medium acidity and more saline notes. "
6924,7562740,Absolutely amazing wine
6925,7562740,Blend of 5 grapes  Vinci regional Alentejano  
6926,7562740,"(89/100) Very nice white from a new project in Alentejo, from the producers of Mirabilis.   33% Arinto + 33% Alvarinho + 34% Antão Vaz Aging: 9 Months French Oak Barrels 80% used + 20% new   Notes of ripe citrus, white plum and hints of french oak. Very elegant and creamy on the mouth, a bit smoky and feelings of orange peel. Medium to long finish full with pleasure."
6927,7562740,This is a classy animal for sure. 4.2 Lemon posset with a sunshine glaze.  Perfect harmony between the acidity and the fruit.  A beautiful aperitif and came alive when the seafood arrived - as did we!  Terrific stuff. On the hunt for more.  
6928,7562740,"clear pale golden clean medium+ youthfull nose of vanilla, dried apricot, lavender, orange peel, yellow candy, green plum. Dry medium+ acidic medium+ alcohol medium+ body, medium + flavour intense flavour of peach, orange. medium+ finish very good. Has some ageing potential. medium priced."
6929,7562740,Great complexity and good fruit flavours. Judicious use of oak. Pity of bitterness in aftertaste.
6930,7562740,"No grapes labeled my guess is Antão Vaz.. The vineyard markets it self on a couple of different acronyms, most notably Cortes de Cima. With around 450 m of altitude for the best wines to more clay oriented grounds - this will fall in the later category. But with an acceptable Price worthiness this straw yellow 14% white wine is good for your spicy shellfish oriented stews, where the wine will maybe disappear - but good acidity and body still will stand up to the spices."
6931,7562740,Fruity with a light oaky note Pairing very good with  Marinaded lemon chicken  
6932,7562740,"It was supposed to be just one glass, but we ended up taking the whole bottle for dinner. Surprisingly good and refreshing, just brilliant!"
6933,7562740,"Sweet acidic wine, adequate to be associated with an aperitif."
6934,2402435,"Nice but trivial, black fruit, little red fruit, and very little oak..."

6936,2402435,Amazing with t-bone 🥩 
6937,2402435,Ripe dark berries. Balanced and pleasant tannins. A little wood smoke and chocolate. And good with cheeses and meat 
6938,2402435,"A Portuguese red blend that’s value driven.  Deep garnet in color with earthy notes of dark fruit   Medium/full bodied with a tart fruit expression.  Tannins are gripping and the acidity is fair.  Super dry mouthfeel tilts the wines balance.   On the palate it’s black cherry, red currant and licorice  86pts"
6939,2402435,"Slightly dry with nice notes of dark berries. Easy to drink, nice with cheese."
6940,2402435,"Regular table douro wine, pretty smooth if you let it breath, bought in Portugal it's a good value for the money. The terroir is definitely a Douro slopes one."
6941,2402435,Surprisingly fruity and pleasantly Douro. I loved visiting this winery and the variety of wines and the hospitality. Would love to find this more available in the US. 
6942,2402435,Still Young and a bit agressive
6943,2402435, red fruit chocolate cherry
6944,2402435,"Simple aromas, rough tanins, not much to.speak or brag about..."
6945,2402435,  red fruit chocolate 
6946,2402435,Too dry and acid for my taste. But is a good wine for the price. 
6947,2402435,"Dark red, controled acidity.Berries."
6948,2402435,Underwhelming but palatable - too young for me.
6949,1829667,"🇪🇸 En Portugal. Sorpredida no esperaba un buen espumoso en Portugal. Muy bueno. Seco, burbuja fina y justa. 🇺🇸 In Portugal. Surprised. I didn’t expect this good sparkling wine in Portugal. Very nice. Dry, fine and fair bubbles."
6950,1829667,"Full creamy toasty nose with aroma of apples. Good acidity, maybe a little short on the palate."
6951,1829667,Red fruits light lovely and summery
6952,1829667,"Excellent finale of the wnd. My first 'champanoise' from Cartuxa. Monovariatal Touriga National. Copper rose in the glass with concistent, white foam - big bubbles at the beginning converting to endless, fine perleage later. Flowery notes on the nose with subtle red fruit, dried apple, pear keeping the gates. Very dry, savory, acidic on the palate. Excitingly refreshing with a subtle drop of bitterness. Salinity&minerality's the ID on a mouthfeel. V.nice bubbly! 4 points from our sunny terrace today. "
6953,1829667,"Very interesting Blanc de Blancs Méthode sparkling from Portugal 🇵🇹  👁 Light gold with delicate to large bubbles 👃  Dried apple, cream, honey and bitter almond. Distinct yeast and warm bread aromas which is not surprising for this 8 year old wine. 👅 Creamy mouthfeel with aromas of yellow apple, cream and perfectly balanced grapefruit acidity. Note: The arinto grapes are fermented “sur lie” for six months. Degorgement is after 5 years of fermentation in the bottle! "
6954,1829667,At enoteca Cartuxa.  Really good as just a glass with nothing.  Nicely aged.  Honey.  Good 7 year-old.  5.25 €/ glass (again huge glass)
6955,1829667,"Love this very good Portuguese sparkling! Body, yeast, balance, always a great choice!"
6956,1829667,"Brightly golden with intense yeast notes on the nose, this sparkling Arinto is probably not for everyone but I enjoyed it. Toast, cream and honey notes throughout, big bubbles."
6957,1829667,Honey ... citrus ... toast ... little bit of resin ... small bubbles ... Arinto grapes ... from 2012 grapes ... okay but I expected more
6958,1829667,Soft not dry. Easy to drink. 
6959,1829667,Fresh Dry Bubbles wine From Alentejo Methodo Classico! Blind it would beat a lot of French Champagne!
6960,1829667,"Golden  colour,  small and tight air pearls, toasted and fermented sent,  great and persistent acidity with the tipical aromas of a nice bubbly... Surprisingly good...   But far from being great, for that it needed some Chardonnay ..."
6961,1829667,"Lovely golden colour reminiscent of the sun setting over the hills outside Évora. Medium density mouse making it perfect accompaniment with canapés and such. Fresh taste with a hint of oak to ground the flavor. Cartuxa a reliable producer, will be back for more"
6962,1829667,Very enjoyable for sparkling
6963,1829667,Happy new year My Friends !!!!!
6964,1361159,Full of spices and herbs
6965,1361159,"4.1/5. Nice Douro heavyweight wine. Rich taste and aroma, a lot of dark fruit, average tannins, intense notes of vanilla and plum. Recommend."
6966,1361159,"@ PORTUGAL VACATIONS - 2018 - Last day in Lisbon and Portugal, I repeated last night’s restaurant because it was great! I chose this outstanding Douro wine. Intense red color. Ellegant nose with mature fruits as plum, blackberries and blueberries rounded up by mushrooms, wet grass and subtile smoked. In mouth, a wine with personality. Great body and structure. You could almost chew it. Well integrated tannins and oak with remarkable fruity and vegetals flavors. Medium lasting and amazing aftertaste. Cheers!"
6967,1361159,"Colour is dark carmine. Velvety and heavy. Taste enters your mouth. There is dark berries,  fig, velvety mouth feeling in secondary taste. Oak and vanilla. Heavy and strong. Black currant. Very good with food. "
6968,1361159,Deep dark red colour; purple rim Dark fruit and cocoa on the nose Dark fruit and racy tannins in the taste
6969,1361159,Smells like fruit bomb but the taste is rather mineral. Veeery good.
6970,1361159,"Round and pleasant. Moderate tannins. Vanilla, leather, oak, pepper and blackberry on the palate."
6971,1361159,"Smoke and cherries on the nose, with more leathery and oaky palate. Decent douro"
6972,1361159,"A really fullbodied excellent Reserva made from 5 different grapes..A bit burnt taste with a long aftertaste of black berries, vanilla and some ok. Light tannins. Will be great to local Portuguese dishes enjoyed in one of Porto's best restaurants. What a lucky feeling!"
6973,1361159,"Mild on the nose, some vanilla but not much else. Stronger on the tongue, with pepper, dark fruits, strong tannins. Very good wine. "
6974,1361159,Full bodied. A real blend from Douro. Red and black fruits all over. Strong tannins with a silk touch at the end. To repeat. 4.0
6975,1361159,"First time trying this style and I liked it! Pale ruby, hazy look. Complex nose with Vanilla , dark cherry oak over-ripe strawberries, and a bit tobacco. Fruity on the palate with strawberries and again dark cherry. A bit spicy finnish. "
6976,1361159,4.4 star. Dark in the colour. On the palate it is quite soft and nice for a Douro. Small tannins and very gentle. Medium long in the Finnish. Works great to medium big food and if you prefers a softer wine
6977,1361159,"Excellent Douro! Delicious red fruits, blueberries, wild flowers and grass on the nose. Well balanced, but more acidic palate. Leather and smoke. Slighty oaked. Dry,  rounded tanins. Had it by the glass at a winebar at Porto airport.Now available at Vinmonopolet back home!"
6978,1361159,"Good but nothing special, light and soft tannins, on the nose it has candied fruit and light tannins, on the palate it has light tobacco and light leather notes."
6979,1960436,"4,25. Dark ruby w m/bluish tint. Tasted blind I was barolo on this one. Cherry, oak, flower, leaves and balsamic nose. Prominent mouth coating tannines. Should age very well.  Very nice. "
6980,1960436,Opened 1st bottle and slight tainting or possible oxidation 😢 but second bottle better colour and better nose and lovely cherry and balsamic notes. Good mouth feel and now is good time to drink (7 years old)
6981,1960436,"Another exciting portuguese red wine. This one from the north and on the Baga grape.  👃 powerful, smoke, balsamic leather  👄 red fruit, chocolate and cherry/ raspberry   Won't say it has the level of Luis Seabra' wines, bit yet another reminder that portugal have more to offer than Port 🍷"
6982,1960436,Frutado encorpado e com final 
6983,1960436,"Very young, which you could notice on the strong tannins as well. Rich with red fruit, concentrated and seductive. Good acidity as well. You should definitely keep it cellared for a couple of years, shows a lot of potential. Unoaked though."
6984,1960436,To take in consideration!
6985,1960436,Amazing. Very very very complex. Aroma is fantastic. The only problem - it is too young. It must stay for more 10-20 years to be drinkable. Now it is only for collection.
6986,1960436,A little bit thin. No character. This grapes not for me 
6987,1960436,"Ruby colour, medium intensity nose, with red fruits, many wild berries, raspberry syrup, some vegetation. Taste is medium light intensity as well, with olives typical from this region, but still the red fruits, very high acidity, very sour, sour sugar, if this acidity holde and this wine develops a bit more flavours this can be a very good wine. But it is unlikely, possible still. Dry, short finish."
6988,1960436,Will be much better in ten years from now.
6989,1960436,"Made from 100% Baga this wine has an amazing structure with medium + acid and tannins. The nose is elegant showing ripe to dry red fruit, savoury herbs, and forest floor.  The palate shows tarter red fruit with a nice freshness and elegance as well. A wine that will keep getting better with time similar to Nebbiolo in style."
6990,2313022,"Very fruity, and very light, a lovely hint of red fruit, very pleasant, a subtle Oak smell to this wine, I actually think that this is now my favourite wine! "
6991,2313022,"Very nice wine with berries flavors,  specially 1st day of lockdown after few months free covid... stay safe and be kind"
6992,2313022,Great value.  Lovely berry and cherry flavors.  Good mouthfeel.  Medium weight
6993,2313022,"Beautifully concocted bottle of wine, starts with a soft wild blackberry notes slowly intensifying the warm and wild berry flavor with mid range heights of the tannin culminating with a soft but contrasting finish."
6994,2313022,With 42! @[1|15045241|Ricardo Gouveia]

My only criticism is the 15% alcohol percent which I personally find to be too strong for red wine. If the alcohol level had been lower I would have given a 5.0 as it was truly delicious.

With around 450 m of altitude for the best wines to more clay oriented grounds - this will fall in the later category. But with an acceptable Price worthiness this straw yellow 14% white wine is good for your spicy shellfish oriented stews, where the wine will maybe disappear - but good acidity and body still will stand up to the spices."
7166,7562740,"It was supposed to be just one glass, but we ended up taking the whole bottle for dinner. Surprisingly good and refreshing, just brilliant!"
7167,7562740,"Frutos secos, boa estrutura. Final de boca longuíssimo. Top!"
7168,7562740,This is a classy animal for sure. 4.2 Lemon posset with a sunshine glaze.  Perfect harmony between the acidity and the fruit.  A beautiful aperitif and came alive when the seafood arrived - as did we!  Terrific stuff. On the hunt for more.

Needs some breathing (13% ABV) and not be be chilled too much.   Stunning freshness and acidity, this wine I will stock up for next summer!   First sip brings citrus and minerals with green notes of grass and apple. Light bodied, dry and citric on the palate with more of sweet fruit - apricot and passion fruit. Persistent and acidic through out.  "
7181,2795309,"Excelente este Vinha Grande! Um Douro muito bem conseguido. Num amarelo casca de limão tem um nariz com aromas  a base de flores e alguma fruta.

7191,6388493,"Special, complex yet not imposing. This could go beautifully with many different things. A really amazing wine!"
7192,6388493,"To save. Very good smells, delicate tannins and a bit of a drier profile. Texture is good but not silky. Persistency is short and honest."
7193,6388493,"A bit of chocolate, and oak flavor. Very good wine for most of occasion. Good value for money."
7194,6388493,"Very interesting discovery. Made on the Portuguese Atlantic coast, hit at same time by hot sun and fresh Atlantic breeze. Starts off with floral aromas of violet, eucalyptus and then evolves to chocolate notes. For this prize, a really great wine "

7199,6388493,"After outstending Pinot Noir from this winery there were big enough expectations to find another treasure in the bottle. Unfortunately, this one's an entry level 100% Syrah which is far away from being memorable.  L: Dark ruby, mid.viscous, lovely legs. N: Dark fruit, mint, herbs, oak. P: Soft fruit&oak, med.bodied, soft&smooth, balanced but all linear. Ok aftertaste.  No bad feelings looking at the price but would not repeat either. Acceptable table wine. 3,3 points."
7200,6388493,"Great value Syrah making the most of the cool Atlantic wind flowing over the vineyard. Earthy nose with blackberry, black cherry, pepper, clove and a bit of cinnamon followed by a juicy palate with tart acidity, dry but constructive tannines and vanilla. 3.7"

7204,1212663,Some evolution but nice 
7205,1212663,"Interesting. Some remnants of a black fruit profile largely superseded by oxidative notes of leather, tobacco, cigar, stable, barnyard, and forest floor"

7207,1212663,A beautiful light red wine

7209,1212663,Home sweet home Tânia Joana Joe
7210,6607730,"Not sure I’ve ever given 4.5 to a white wine before. Perhaps because it is so cheap: £14 in the Azenho do Mar seafood restaurant in Azenho do Mar, Alentejo, Portugal, and it’s really sunny and the mussels are fine and life is sweeeet. Unlike the wine which is somehow dry yet fruity, clean yet complex, Democrat yet Republican, a glorious Alentejo take on Alvarinho"
7211,6607730,"Mind blown by this wine from the moment I first open the bottle. This is not the usual Alvarinho, but definitely it can thrive also in the Alentejo coast. Hints of lime and lemon on the nose, very gentle fizz and loads of minerals on the mouth. Best when stupidly cold"
7212,6607730,Consistently good. Impressively mineral
7213,6607730,An excellent Alvarinho from the alentejo coast. This winery produces excellent whites. Need to try the reds. 
7214,6607730,"A wine to be blessed with. Green apple, yes, peach, yes… but et la mint?"
7215,6607730,"Very intensive herbal nose. All herbs you can find in a herb shop. Mouth herbal as well, concentrated but still light. I definitely miss fruit in this wine but the tastes are not discussed🙂"
7216,6607730,Fruity and floral notes.  tropical passion fruit pineapple minerals
7217,6607730,Best Alvarinho South of the Alvarinho zone.
7218,6607730,Good but needs food 
7219,6607730,"Tropical fruit, peach and a little citrus. Beautiful Alvarinho."
7220,6607730,Fresh wine with a profound taste of fruit. Perfect with wine and cheese.
7221,6607730,Good but not the best 
7222,6607730,"A super wine from this area. Introduced to me by Filipe at Paixao do Vinho in Maderia. Clean, dry mineral and citric. Will be buying this back in Lisbon. "
7223,6607730,"Real grade 3,75, good Portuguese Alvarihno, but there is something missing. Maybe i am used to Spanish Albariño and on my opinion they are slight better."
7224,6607730,"Unctous, fruity, sporting a good acidity. Well done!"
7225,1209611,"Smooth, well-balanced, easy drinking and delicious, if not particularly memorable. Probably a 3.5-3.8 star bottle all told but at under $10, this is an absolute steal."
7226,1209611,"3.8 - SAQ Depot Deep dark red. Fruity bouquet with hints of oak. Medium-full bodied, smooth, well balanced with no acidity. Taste of dark cherry and oak. Was served a little too cold… recommended at 17oC. Paired with an all dressed pizza. But suggested pairing of gamey meats, cheese, and pasta."
7227,1209611,Aromas of toasted oak and ripe cherry and a hint of orange liqueur on the nose. Some earth and wet stone on the palate along with some red fruit and green bell pepper. Medium body and medium acid. Grape stem like aftertaste with smooth tannins.
7228,1209611,Love this wine ! Bold and non acidic. Really nice to drink. Not much sugar either. Should really have a higher rating. Will be drinking again!
7229,1209611,Bright color. Initial hints of vanilla. Hints of cherry or raspberry maybe. Over all smooth and the word polite came to mind after my first taste.  Served with swordfish (Mediterranean marinade) and broccoli. Would not do again. 
7230,1209611,"Nice value for the price. Intense aromas of red fruit, cherry and vanilla follows on the palate with some blueberry and subtle oak. Moderate to high tannins, with a short burst finish but decent. "
7231,1209611,"Dry, smooth,  easy drinking red wine.  Medium tannins. Subtle oak with hints of vanilla and slight lemon and vanilla on palate.   Excellent wine  for the price. "
7232,1209611,"Surprisingly rich and aromatic. Notes of berries, vanilla, and chocolate.  "
7233,1209611,Plum and black berries. Good for meet 
7234,1209611,"Deep purple colour. Moderate nose of strawberry jam, black cherry, prune, vanilla, coconut, and oak. Dry, juicy palate of strawberry jam, blackberry, dried blueberry, and vanilla with medium low acidity. Medium to full bodied with soft, ripe tannins. Jammy finish of medium length. Good price and decent value."
7235,1209611,"Dark purple. Dark fruit on the nose. Dry, medium body, medium acid, high grippy tannins. Definitely an inexpensive table wine lacking a lot of complexity and drinking young. Plum, blackberry, rhubarb bitterness. 3/5"
7236,1209611,"Always great bang for your buck with ripe, but not over extracted, dark fruit. Supple tannins and good acid means it goes great with a variety of dishes."
7237,1209611,Really nice balanced flavourful wine for this price … competition as my new “go to” under $10 … for now 
7238,1209611,"Coconut and pineapple candy, red apple. Some vanilla. Nice bodied."
7239,1209611,"This wine is currently toying with my taste buds as I partake.  It seems to be betwixt what could become a passion yet at the same time full of fear and loathing in Douro.  I get a wisp of coconut and oak and cherry.  Dry, bold and very dark like my luvers.  Time will test this one as the evening progresses.  "
7240,3420920,"Rich, smooth and full bodied red. Beautiful dark claret, with notes of oak and juicy dark fruits. Pairs excellently with beef. And a very enjoyable bottle shape too.  Will definitely be enjoying this one again! "
7241,3420920,"Deep and dark, purple. Marzipan and plums with a hint of raspberries though little depth. Smooth and well balanced - a little of everything: fruit, tannins, body and finish. Nice bottle shape, too. A new world attitude from the old world."
7242,3420920,"🍷 A nice gradient of ruby, dark purple and subtle hues of tawny brown   👃 In the sniffy sniff, aromas of fresh berries and forest smells... Wet wood, foliage, red currents, blackberries and plums with some ashy notes   👅 In the mouth, silky smooth tannins and medium acidity pave the way for fresh zingy fruits, baked Victoria plums, black cherries, spiced red apples and blood oranges with notes vanilla and cinnamon   🥂 I am thoroughly pleased with this wine, great value at only £8 from Aldi."
7243,3420920,"Slightly cloudy dark crimson with thin clear legs. Blackberry and savoury nose. Dry with elevated alcohol and acid and well integrated but prominent tannins - this wind has the structure and complexity for further ageing.  Flavours of blackberry and blueberry, and some savoury notes of mushroom and meat. Full bodied and moderate to long length. A fine example of Douro reds. "
7244,3420920,"Balanced, black forest fruits, very nice indeed. "
7245,3420920,A delicately balanced Douro wine full of fruit with a soft long finish. 15/20
7246,3420920,Porto trip🍷 Above all: RED FRUIT
7247,3420920,Plums with raspberries. Good tannins. But nose is light. Good with chicken.
7248,3420920,Good flavour not so strong on the nose. Like the indigenous grape mix
7249,3420920,"Very good balanced and astringency. Full body, long finish. Blackberry, oak and vanilla aromas "
7250,3420920,"I know this wine is off the beaten path but it is an absolute delight at this price point.  No, this cannot stand up to 4.5 star $100 wine in my book because I price adjust ratings but at this price point it is a steal.  Serve a little chilled and then let it open."
7251,3420920,Very nice and fruity. 
7252,3420920,Punchy but smooth
7253,3420920,Very smooth and dry wine. Easy to drink not very strong in tannic. Has a long lasting after taste that is enjoyable. Pretty good and decent wine. Best one so far from all the Portuguese wines I’ve tried.  oak blackberry black fruit
7254,3420920,"Cracking drop at the price, god bless you Aldi."
7255,1378113,"Wines of Portugal, June 10 - wine fair - quick notes - special blend, full bodied, long finish. Trincadeira, Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet. 12 months in oak. 14,5% abv. Rate 3,8"
7256,1378113,Nice bouquet deep red Alentejo. Oaky initially though the ripe fruit notes become more notable after breathing this red for a while. Dry full body and very pleasant. 
7257,1378113,Excelente custo beneficio 
7258,1378113,One of the best Alentejo red i have ever had!

7261,1378113,"Fruity, good tasting and affordable "
7262,1378113,"Blind tasting @[1|7741911|Boris Sarin] (6/8)  First feeling, a bit ""close"" with roasted scents and tight tannins. But, by letting it open in my glass, I notice a slow evolution... It's get enriched with more fruity notes (ripe blackberries & blueberries) as well as some cocoa flavors. An anticipate breathing would have been welcome because this wine doesn't reveal all its charms to us. A true pity  !  Nevertheless, a muscular wine that seems built for keeping and that I would like to taste again in a few year. "
7263,1378113,"4.0/5.0 Again well matured wine. Less noble then previous. More herbaceous notes, barnyard, other tertiary nuances.  Resume: nice, but not in love )  RWC meeting: Red Portugal. 11.01.2018"
7264,1378113,"Deep ruby red colour. Dense, spicy and juicy aroma of wet forest, leather, benzoil, cassis, gooseberry, tar, graphite and slightly licorice. Medium bodied,  pleasant and warm acidity, perfect balanced. Pepper and chocolate on palate. Tannins are soft, velvet and wellaged. Long pleasant finish with a hint of plums and dark chocolate. Very nice!"
7265,1378113,"Really surprised with this great Alentejo red,16 years of outstanding evolution!Decanted for 2 hours,opened up with a very deep garnet color and a brown rim,thick long legs.Not a bit shy,the nose is yummy,aromas of deep ripe fruit,coffee and leather,mint and liquor,cigar box.The best part is the mouth,still full with good acidity and rounded tannins,dark fruit and licorice hand in hand with sweet spices,smooth,vanilla and raisins!The end is long begging for another sip!"
7266,1378113,"Good balance,  nice plum and oak aroma"
7267,1378113,Dry. Opened up beautifully with a little time and paired with Italian sausage
7268,1378113,very good. oaky. Good body
7269,1378113,"Old wine, light brick colour. Great for people who like old wines. Open 2 hours before drinking."
7270,5036589,Nice value for money
7271,5036589,Nice balance. Not too acidic. Pear and Peach. 
7272,5036589,"Very nice dry white, lovely acidity  a lot of pear and some citric flavour "
7273,5036589,Good flavours and acidity but extra dry. Good for strong dishes.
7274,5036589,"Grim. Just don't. I mean, it's probably my unsophisticated palette, but this was way too dry with a harsh, pungent nose and bitter aftertaste. Nasty."
7275,5036589,Super wine for the price 
7276,1117316,"Another year, another vintage. Never disappoints. "
7277,1117316,A nice rich wine with cherry and oak filling the palate. A happy wine.
7278,1117316,Very nice blend from the Altejano region😃👍🌞🍷🍇  4.2⭐
7279,1117316,Fruity and oaky on the nose; leather. But doesn’t really live up to that promise on drinking. Acidity. Fine but nothing special. 
7280,1117316,Some mild suave tannins for a good Sunday roast. Wasn’t expecting too much and ended up pleasantly surprised perhaps the Cabernet helped a bit. Worth a try!
7281,1117316,Great seafood accompaniment 
7282,1117316,"Medium ruby color with a small dark rose rim. Raspberries, cassis, vanilla, oak with a iodine, algae hint. Attack is fruity, med palate is quite dry and oaky, with tannins that could be more integrated. "
7283,1117316,"I also tried the red 👁‍🗨uinta do Carmo. It was served a bit too warm so not easy to get it.  Earthy nose with clove, black cherry, oak and vanilla followed by a palate with nice balance between acidity and toasted tannins, again black cherry, blackberry and leather. 3.6"
7284,1117316,Delicious soft red which accompanied my seafood pasta perfectly. 
7285,1117316,An interesting nose with goosenerry and rhubarb. A bit acidic on the palate. I nice finish. Some balanced tannins. 
7286,1117316,Lemon and white flowers. Great mouthfeel. Ideal with white fish and octopus. 
7287,1117316,Way too much acidity
7288,1117316,"Good light wine, goes well with seafood"
7289,1117316,A must taste wine. At the first day of 2021 is still great to drink. Very round and smooth on the mouse
7290,1117316,Beautiful medium dry wine. Great flavour and perfect acidity.
7291,1259564,Fantastic Bairrada gem. Lots of fruits and freshness. Vanilla and casked oak. Even a hint of port berries. Would recommend plenty of air-time before serving.
7292,1259564,"Repeat tasting and similar notes. In the glass it has an opaque garnet-ruby core with mahogany reflections and a brick orange rim. The nose took me straight to Barolo with notes of cherry, black raspberry, cacao, leather, cedar and underbrush. At 24 years of age, the palate shows impressive structure, with still present tannins and a lifted finish.i drank this immediately after the 1985 Barolo on Saturday and they were strikingly similar. A fantastic wine and high QPR. "
7293,1259564,"Only God knows where and why a winery keeps a wine for 24 years then decides to release it.  Anyway, this Bairadda wine is a gem. Ruby/garnet with a touch of Browning on the rim. Packed full of dusty, mineral, fruit of the forest,  bramble,  spice, wood and cigar. Good tannins are still holding firm. I would guess this is 10 years old if tasted blind. "
7294,1259564,Wonderful  Aged to perfection or just about  So glad I got three bottles!
7295,1259564,Paired with the best of friends. Bottle and wine in great shape. A rare previous notes apply. 
7296,1259564,Barolo like mixture of baga and moreto 
7297,1259564,"Amazing, mature, yet still full of youth! Go figure. Proof that Baga as a grape is perfect for the long-term. Still great structure, impressive tannins - bold yet integrated - alongside some good levels of acidity. Fruit is still present, deep plum, damson and a slight bite of cherry - giving that hint of youth. The fruit really works in harmony with savoury forest floor notes and hints of leather and tobacco. If able to, give this an hour in decanter before serving to allow it to open up. Awesome value!"
7298,1259564,"Unique and wonderful wine from Portugal. Dry nose moves onto a cranberry mouthfeel and a really pleasant result. Medium dry, earthy tones and a slightly tart finish. Really impressed by this wine. "
7299,1259564,"👃Baked, spiced figs and dates  👅 The figs and spice are prominent and there are also some slight mocha tastes as well.   Still has grippy tannins after all these years. Nothing overly complex but a real treat!"
7300,1259564,"Full of life. Tertiary flavours and a definite portyness. A sour red fruit note of cranberry too. Amazed to find that this was made entirely without oak. The blend consists of castelão, baga, and the now extinct varietal moreto."
7301,1259564,"Woooey, what a treat! A lively filly with a kick in her step even after 25 years (equivalent to 120 years old in wine years? 🤔). From Bairrada DOC by the Atlantic Coast and made from Baga, Castelão Nacional, Moreto grapes.  Leather, tons of mushroom, juicy blackberry, slate, cranberry + red bean paste, blackcurrant, nutty coconut on the lengthy finish. Enjoyable chewy tannins + zippy acidity holding it all together.  20 min decant. Try if you like old Chateauneuf and old Bordeaux."
7302,1259564,"Interesting and unique red blend with Cabernet  Touriga National and Baga. Baga is a varietal with high tannins and acidity but the age of this one, '95, has tamed the tannins and balanced the acidity. It isn't a fruit bomb but has a great nose of red fruit and earthiness. Really nice wine experience."
7303,1259564,"Wine tasting - what a faff - but a fun faff. I’ve just tasted 5 different contenders (rated 4 or above) on Vivino and every one fell short - interesting at best, disturbing at worst. So I try to benchmark with this fella (I gave a 5 recently) and it blows every other pretender out the park. For me this is a wine to impress, intrigue and inspire. Understated soft mushroom earthy sexy brilliance. Goddamn - One needs a reference point sometimes for life and art, this brings me home quietly with aplomb."
7304,1259564,"Outstanding old wine. Unusual blend of Baga, Castelāo Nacional and Moreto. Dark red. Vanilla nose. Soft and well balanced palate. High acidity, tannins smooth with age. Fruit still present with earthy acidic finish."
7305,1259564,"Still alive, rich in animal aromas, leather, spicy, olive, ripe fruits and present acidity which indicate more longivity. A must drink"
7306,2194892,"Citric yellow color. Intense aroma, predominating the bakery notes. In the mouth it is very tasty, full-bodied and creamy and with excellent acidity. Fresh and persistent finish. Excellent value for money. Very good sparkling wine."
7307,2194892,Happy new 2021! Good 👌🏾😌 🍾
7308,2194892,"Pretty sure this bottle was corked. Not to the point where it was undrinkable but definitely cardboard notes & an overall muted nose & palate.  Drank at the beach, was the only bottle I brought so it had to get finished regardless.  Dry, m+ acid, m body, delicate mousse, m- finish. Perceptible drying finish almost tannic(corked).  M aroma intensity: muted notes of lemon, lemon peel, bruised apple, pear, gravel, stone, yeast.   M flavour intensity: muted orchard fruit, saline, lemon pith, minerality.  2.8/5"
7309,2194892,"Rather good sparkling for the price. Honey, toast and a touch of citrus peel and orange blossom on the nose. Pleasant acidity mixed with minerals, citrus and freshness. Rating 3.6"
7310,2194892,3.6* oak honey 
7311,2194892,Taste extra  with mineral touch
7312,2194892,Smooth crisp and clean with a hint of oak
7313,2194892,Dry and with very fine bubbles (as it should be) resembles a nice Prosecco
7314,2194892,"Fruity, yet dry. Best with seafood"
7315,2194892,"Fruit, light and very fresh, to go along to good desert...!"
7316,2194892,Just buy Murganheira 
7317,2194892,"Taken at Hotel da Estrella, bought at Garrafeira nacional, on staff's recommend saying ""only Chardonnay is no acid so with Arinto .  Perfect combination for espumante :)"".  And true.  7.5€"
7318,2194892,Really nice for the money!! 🍷🤙
7319,2194892,Great sparking from Bairrada!
7320,2194892,"Great sparkling. Outstanding value. Rich but balanced. Complete. Great quality and pure persistence. Great wine between 3,5 and 4."
7321,2395325,"Chilled red wine , so tannin is lighter than normal , still very high acidity , tastes lots of herbs , quite strange combinations "
7322,2395325,"95 rating! Holy shit! The 69' is the best of the 65' and 67' put together. It is still fruity, plum, strawberry, cassis, tobacco and raisins. Absolutley amazing. "
7323,2395325,"Light mahogany purple. Smells of dried strawberries, forest floor and dusty old wooden shelves. A bit of mushroom on the palate, fully resolved dried plum fruit with fine-grained tannins giving a small kick on the finish. Mature and graceful."
7324,2395325,"Pale garnet brown. Raisin, plum, spice, cocoa, leather and dusty finish.  Chocolate. Still alive. Mouth coating tannins, not just acidity, as I find in aged bdx. "
7325,2395325,Absolutely fabulous ! How is it possible that a wine with more than 50 years seems like it was produced 5 yrs ago??? 
7326,2395325,"Really interesting wine. The nose isn't too dissimilar to an old Barolo, tar/leather and dried flowers. Palate is nothing like old Barolo hahaha. It's really bizarre, and I'm assuming atypical, but the main fruit characteristic is like this tart stewed plum. Then there is a whole bunch of tannin that comes through. Unbelievable to see this level of acidity, tannin and even salinity from a wine of this age. Anyway that's my rant about the 67"
7327,2395325,Fantastic bottle that is full of subtlety. Starts with gravel and fig aromas. Medium texture. As it opens there is just so much more going on. Really enjoyed this
7328,2395325,"It’s an experience to drink this unique Portuguese wine. It should be kept at a cooler temperature and then allowed to breathe in the glass. As it breathes, the flavor opens up so it’s maybe better to start with sips to check out the changes. "
7329,2395325,"Earthy notes, tobacco, mint with nice jammy red fruit of cherry and raspberry, remarkable freshness given the age.   Palate was M-F bodies with very supple tannins and good acidity.   Unbelievable given the age"
7330,2395325,"A special bottle, took nearly two hours to open properly. Small cork delicately removed in one piece with regular corkscrew. Nose dominated by menthol and forest floor, with still-kicking blackberry, raspberry, plum, black licorice and tight tannins. Saddle leather, cedar. Slight twinge of vinegar needs the fat of a rich meal to cut - paired with a dry-aged Snake River Farms NY strip and was delicious. Rusty garnet color. A big wine with an everlasting finish, if perhaps slightly past its absolute prime. "
7331,2395325,"Dark Ruby some purple. Semi bold and dry. Good acidity. A pleasant and “different” wine. Forest floor, minerals, red currant and plum. Nice finish with some bitter taste."
7332,2395325,Rating: 4.2  Vintage: 2012  Nose: Charred Green Bell Pepper. Dried Leather. Earth. Damp Oak. Menthol (slight).  Palate: Several different fruits peaking at different intervals (Cherry. Strawberry. Raspberry. Plum.). Raisin and Milk Chocolate  midway. A vegetal note on the backend (Rhubarb).   Body: M Body. M+ Tannins. Dry. M+ Acidity.   Color: Mahogany (w/ Ruby edges).  Grape: Ramisco (100%)  ABV: 12.5%  Notes: Definitely an interesting wine. Bottle is in 500ml format. 
7333,2395325,"4.1. Tasted blind and thought it was a well aged Brunello. Firm tannins, cherry and plum, hints of baking spice. Also some restrained oak notes as well as bits of toffee and caramel right on the finish. So glad I could try this back vintage right in its drinking window."
7334,2395325,"Fresh and fruity nose of strawberries, redcurrant, sour cherries, oak and a hint of eucalyptus. Medium bodied and quite tight with firm acidity and soft tannins. Somewhat akin to an older style of Rioja or Barolo. I rather like it. 92-94p."
7335,2395325,"Gorgeous and very unique. Intoxicating fragrant nose showing violet, fig, red meat and minerality. Concentrated, complex palate showcasing clear blackberry, red plum, black cherry, herbs and lots of salinity. Lovely juicy acidity and Paired with a picanha. It cost around $30:"
7336,6656388,"Wine made 100% with ""Tinta mole"" grapes.  A mild aroma of red fruit.  In the mouth it is fresh and mineral, with medium acidity.  Nice and very refreshing finish.  Excellent surprise."
7337,1524282,"Crimson. Elegant, concentrated and spicy. Leather, cedar, black currant and celery root. Slightly acidic and tart finish. Good wine!"
7338,1524282,"Deep inky Red, aromas of sour cherry, liquorice, fennnel, leather. Medium + body, dry and tannic, quite powerfull aftertaste, dark chocolate, plum, berries and a pinch o ripe kiwi. "
7339,1524282,"4,2 - this was brought by me and was my #3 and the pack’s #4. This was a wine that changed completely over the course of the evening and as time passed by gained a lot in body and complexity. "
7340,1524282,"Me gusta! This is pretty damn good. Savory acidity, fresh restrained fruit but with something dark and brooding in the background. This is serious as a heart attack; the wine to drink when you’re solving the world’s problems. "
7341,1524282,"Bold but elegant Dao blend of 70% Touriga Nacional, 15% Tinta Roriz, 15% Alfrocheiro. Pressed by foot in concrete lagar, 18 mo in barriques.  Nose of blueberry, strawberry, forest floor, salty black licorice, wild mint, cigarbox tobacco.   Palate brings powerful acidity but round chewy tannins, big earthy minerality, dried leaves and branches, but with 13.5 abv light on its feet and crisp. Finish of black licorice and blueberry pie with ice cream. Delicious Iberuly #5 🇵🇹"
7342,1524282,"4.2 More ready than 6 months ago, Interesting aromas of dried cherries, blackberries, spices, prune and tobacco leaf. Powerful, full body, good tannins that are almost mature, multilayered, deep and long aftertaste. "

They are extremely reliable and so is this red. It’s a Douro old vinyards (meaning no one knows what exactly is in it) full of red fruit , bright red colour and intense nose to go with it. It may last some years but it’s so smooth as jt is that I’d recommend to drink it all up now.  It went wonderfully with lamb chops and I think any meat will do!"

7486,7085268,"White Vinho verde: greenish color, citric nose with a floral remind. Austere at palate, elegant, crisp acidity. In fact is a blend made of 3 Castas: Loureiro, Trajadura and Arinto. Here in Peru we have few choices talking about Portuguese wines. 13% alc.vol."

7490,7085268,"Interesting, pineapple, much superior to other Loureiros. FN Gastronomia tasting."
7491,7085268,Much heavier vinho Verde than the ones that I am used to. Long flavour oaky and orange fruits
7492,7085268,Smooth... Loureiro at is best!

7494,1636879,Great one! It is the same age as me!
7495,1636879,"Purple to ruby in the glass. Modestly intense bouquet of dried fruits. Sweet and full bodied. Figs, cherries, vanilla, cocoa. Medium and well integrated tannins."
7496,1636879,"Wow. Not the most expensive but  this one was great with milk chocolate from Nidar. Great match.  Plums, rasins but not to sweet.  I think I would love it with a creamy white molded cheese. Brilliant Savarin (doble milk). "
7497,1636879,"A TWANY PORTO blend, from Portugal 🇵🇹, of Tinto Cao, Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Sousao, Tinta Amarela, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Francisca.

"
7498,1636879,"Thought I'd try a Niepoort port instead of the Douro. This was less jammy and full. But that was good news as it was also more complex than the heavy Raisin oriented Douros, well the ones I've had 😄"
7499,1636879,"Concentrated ruby port from ripe year 2009. Alcohol is still overriding, but not as heady as the standard entry level ports. Tealike tannins, dades, sweet spice, raisin. @LaGironde, Rotterdam."
7500,1636879,"Medium tears, splendid body, full ruby taste "
7501,1636879,"Nutty, toasty, developed and rich. Like old money, doesn't brag about it which makes it so much richer but more discrete. Superb!"
7502,1636879,"Candied prunes and dried fruit, dark fruit"
7503,1636879,"The fall season has really started...  Wet and humid, some wind and dark afternoons. For me this screams for port 😉🍷  And this LBV is just a treat in these circumstances. It has got all one expects in a good LBV, in a very pleasing restrained style. Alcohol very well integrated.   Comforting richness matching the season 👍 16 pts @ own cellar."
7504,1636879,"This is a lovely unfiltered LBV, aged 4 years in oak casks before release.  Deep purple/ruby colour.  Nose of blackberry, plums, raisins and vanilla.  The palate is really vibrant, with an excellent balance of fruit, acidity and tannins.  Black cherry, blackberry, fig, baking spices.  3.5* on opening, 4* with time.    The advice from the producer is to drink it in the next 3-5 years, and to be like the Portuguese and pair it with meat, something like a pepper steak or lamb. "
7505,1636879,"JUICY JUICY JUICY !!  This LBV almost seems like an entity unto itself. Led by a revolutionary man, this promise seems to hold up.  This is extremely rich but not jammy. Powerful & almost pretty. Maybe a little seductive, this is more of a flamboyant style.  Filled with deep extracted flavors that actually seem to burst from the glass. Cinnamon, black plum, candied strawberry, blueberry marmalade & nutmeg.  Just a little short of his 2012, but still very good! Arrrrroooooo!!!! 91 pts"
7506,1636879,"Too much time has passed since a bottle of port has been shared in this house. It should be an international habit to drink at least one port per week... a bit like your 5 veggies a day! Playful cherries and hint of dark chocolate, all very enjoyable! Bought at Bottle Apostle, Crouch End, London. "
7507,1636879,"LBV 2009 from Niepoort.  This one was refined in barrels for 4-6 years. Intensive red colur with brown reflexes. Aromas of ripe cherries, cooked berries and dried herbs with an alcoholic touch. On the palate balanced and concentrated with smooth tannins and a well integrated wooden touch.  Full bodied with a quite long finish and a fruity aftertaste with hints of pepper and leather. Really good and perfect with a Tiramisù."
7508,1636879,"⭐4.0 Deep garnet. Nose: raisin, plum, cherry  Palette: chocolate, caramel, raisin, coffee, plum jam. Great LBV from Niepoort "
7509,1686456,"Made with Avesso and Chardonnay, hence the Minho VR instead of Vinho Verde DOC. And jolly good it is too. Pale lemon. Creamy ripe tropical fruit and a yeasty-leesy richness. Peach skins too. Dry and with a superb balance of richness and freshness. Ripe stone fruit (peach) and tropical fruit (pineapple) with fresh fig and melon. A touch of honey. White flowers and a hauntingly fresh minerality, struck flint and smokiness. Lovely."
7510,1686456,"Tasted at Covela's historic estate—a Renaissance manor that sits frozen in time, poised at the mouth of the Douro Valley, along a southern-facing amphitheater robed in lush greenery. The 2013 Escolha Branco is a blend of Avesso and Chardonnay, with a few years of age, offers perfumy aromas of dried honey and orange blossom. Barrel fermentation lends texture, refinement and creaminess. This is a balanced, poetic wine, bright and fresh with delicate mineral filaments wending in and out of stone fruit. Sample"
7511,1686456,"Very nice. Dence, mineral. Long, impressive finish."
7512,1686456,Elegant and mineraly. Clean palate with a long finish. Nicely balanced acid
7513,1686456,Good acidity better served at 12-14 C.
7514,1686456,"Pale lemon colour, lots of green fruits in the nose, green apple, green pears, green bananas. Some vegetation there too, tomato leaf and bayleaf. Taste is light intensity. But also very fruit driven. High acidity and sort of fizzy on the middle of your tongue. Medium short finish."
7515,1686456,very fruity and very drinkable.  nice wine to drink even if you don't eat. Aromático
7516,1686456,Great value for money. Rich taste and perfect to the fresh fish we had!

7523,1686456,Amazing wine! Tastes like jeropiga! 
7524,22323,Light straw colour. Similar carambola and melon nose to the 2012. The palate is fruitier than the 2012 with white currant ripe red apple and citrus. Still very nice.
7525,22323,This was a crisp white wine with green apple notes and a nice clean finish. The colour was a pale yellow with a charming citrusy nose. It was very refreshing and works well when paired with poultry.
7526,22323,"Faster evolution then expected with slightly oxidized notes and only for lovers of this style... As I am! I loved this wine, its authenticity, it's rustic approach, it's density on the nose and palate. Very long, deep concentrated flavors. Very good"

7528,22323,"caramelised peaches with a buttery aftertaste. This paired up exceptionally well with my rolled belly pork, Porchetta."
7529,22323,"Getting to know dry portuguese wines.  This white one is quite nice. Herbal, lemon tea, sweet pineapple notes. Very nice acidity. Very refreshing.  Perfect as an aperitif in Sintra's main square watching people go by."
7530,22323,"Dry, very fresh and with a fullfilling taste"
7531,22323,"Why talk about what I smell: raspberries, strawberry, mushrooms, leather, green pepper etc etc. What I smell, you don't smell. The smell that I smell today will change over the next months or years. I prefer to focusing on the history of the producer, understand the place where it's made, and how it was done. Appreciating the wine with the right food pairing and the enjoying the special moments the wine is creating is what truly connects people.    "
7532,22323,"Maybe I got wrong match in Vivino. My raiting is low compared to others. Find it with out spine more like fresh lemonade, served by glass and a bit to warm. "

Dry with elevated alcohol and acid, and prominent but fine tannins, suggesting ageing potential. Well balanced gastronomic wine with medium to full body and nice long length. Flavours of blackberry and red currant, and plum and a hint of balsamic vinegar. "
7541,5907829,"Amazing full body, oak, earthy and black fruits. Great value. "

7552,5907829,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. Full-bodied, medium-dry. Still young. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Alentejo region. Contains sulfites. 14,5.° alcohol!   "

7555,1906694,"Medium body,  soft tannins,  clean finish,  fresh"
7556,1906694,"Beautiful fruity nose of ripe blackberries and vanilla. Palate is smooth and delicate, and full of blackberry, black cherry, vanilla, warm oak, and faint leather. Really lovely for the price point. "
7557,1906694,Excellent value for money!
7558,1906694,Solid. Started with it at room temp and server put it on ice. It was an interesting to switch between room temp and on ice. I enjoyed it.
7559,1906694,Great wine!  Pineapple green apple. pear on my pallet as the finish. Though not a sweet wine its dry.  Great balance. Great red wine. Beautiful deep red. 
7560,1906694,"Mid to full bodied. Nose shows plum, cherry, red currants, cranberry.  White pepper, oak, tree bark. Earthy. Slate.   Dry and spicy on the palate. Tart mid plus acidity. Tannins are smooth with a grippy finish.    Only as a reference: Bends more towards Burgundy than Bordeaux. "

7569,8039,"This wine was fantastic. Vivino crashed when I almost finished the description. I'm upset. Coz this wine is so fantastic. So, let's write something. On the nose very rich variety of aromas of red and black fruits. On the palate deliciously jammy with strong flavours mostly of cassis, raspberries, blackberries with toasty and peppery background. Tannins simply perfect. Great structure. Despite strong concentration of many flavours is refreshing with magnificent finish and persistent aftertaste. Great wine."
7570,8039,"Deep ruby colour - garnet rim - pronounced aroma of black wild fruits, like blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, prunes, oak and vanilla. Dry with excellent acidity and high integrated tannins, full bodied, stout with ripe flavours of blackcurrant, prunes, jam and vanilla oak - cigar box. Long finish with elegance and fruitiness aftertaste"

7575,8039,"Medium/deep ruby. Pronounced floral and red fruits aromas with hints of chocolate and smoke. Dry, medium/high acidity, big round tannins, full body with a lot of fruit and oak flavours. Long lasting finish. A beautiful complex wine with different layers and beautiful flavours."
7576,8039,"The name relates when Syrah wasn't allowed in the Alentejo appellation - Syrah been planted in 1991 at Cortes de Cima - a very rich wine with character that needs time to open up, set in a carafe to help the wine get ready quicker "
7577,8039,"Bold, superb balance and sumptuous finish. The mystery name refers to a time when Syrah was not permitted in Alentejo."
7578,8039,"Alentejo   2011   Syrah  El kell ismernem, hogy közel van a tökéletességhez.  Tenho de admitir. Muito próximo da perfeição.  I am obliged to admit - very much close to perfect.  Nothing to add. Nothing else to be said.  Mást nem is kell mondonom.  Nada mais a acrescentar. Mais seria menos."
7579,8039,Took an hour to open up in the decanter - restaurant Pop and pour and wait - deep purple - hugely rich without being in your face - just a lovely wine.

7583,7303481,"On Madeira Island there is only a small production of still (not fortified wines). This one is from big Madeira producer Blandy’s. They produce rose from Tinta Negra and white from Verdelho.   Tinta Negra for rose is sourced from vineyards in Câmara de Lobos and Campanário.  🐽 Medium on the nose, aromas of raspberries, rose petal and pomegranate.   👄 Medium plus acidity (8,71g/l) and touch of residual sugar (7,5g/l), medium body and finish.   Great easy drinking rose.. and if you add the view on Atlantic..."
7584,7303481,"Unique-tasting. Boggling acidity, that works. My first Madeirense rosé. Their tinta negra grape. This 2019 has a beautiful, harmonious, strawberry-starfruit bouquet. Light pomegranate fruit. Then a looong finish with absolutely bracing acidity on the outlines of my tongue. All about the acidity. A perfect match for pulled-pork perogies with lots of sour cream, fresh basil, & (the required) Tabasco green-pepper sauce. What a cornucopia of flavors tonight! 4.0+ woofs. From Addy Bassins. Buy it if you see it."
7585,7303481,"Pale pink color. Strawberry, red apple, pink grapefruit, melon, and chalk nose. Dry.  High acidity.  Strawberry, green apple, red apple, red plum, and white peach.  4.1⭐️ great rosé, uncommon (who makes rosé in Madeira) and the acidity may just strip your teeth enamel!!  The light RS is definitely needed.   8.71 g/L acidity.  7.5g/L RS but not noticeable.  "
7586,7303481,"Pale pink in color with a youthful medium intensity nose. Strawberry, cherry, red plum, melon, rose petal, floral, citrus. Dry, high acidity, medium minus body, medium alcohol and intensity. Stone fruit, red plum, cherry, zest, the sugar helps to cut the acidity. Very good quality of wine. Drink now.    100% Tinta negra, high acidity, 7.5 g/L RS. "
7587,7303481,"Super yum. Cheesy, savoury and olive brine on the nose. Also grapefruit.  Super crushable. Tart of the finish. Delish!! "
7588,7303481,A light freshener of a rose wine strawberry highlights and needs to be cold but a nice wine.
7589,7303481,Second wine of a 5 wine flight in Faro. Really light and refreshing rose. Would drink this all day.

7602,2080765,"Prima wijn, middle of the road."
7603,2080765,First time in Portugal (Lisbon).  Enjoyed this wine. Quite a fruit explosion.   Exactly what I needed!!  Actually paired well with vegetable risotto although a deeper red would have been a bit better.  Overall impressed....maybe a bit easily :)
7604,2080765,"Deep garnet color with a lighter brick red rim.  Berries and spice and everything nice.  (Sorry, it's not even noon and I'm on my second so getting a little silly).  My fort Cab from Portugal - for the price ($9!) it's fantastic!  Great for an office moving day.  Paired really well with margherita pizza.  Light bodied and yummy.  "
7605,2080765,Really enjoyed after Fiuza 3 castas. Lots of dark cherry on the nose with dark and normal cherry on the palate. Nice lasting finish
7606,2080765,"When in Portugal, drink the local stuff. Great value and paired with picapou, the local steak with garlic, salt and a touch of white wine. "
7607,2080765,Fresh tasting wine with berry notes and some mild spice. A relatively light coloured red with a very short finish. Good value for money and accompanies a wide variety of flavours.
7608,2080765,Liked it this time. 
7609,2080765,"Not far off from a cheap Bordeaux, but without the character. Good try, though... "
7610,2080765,Very good Portugese Cabernet Sauvignon. Plenty of flavour.

7615,5027348,went exceptionally well with foie gras and smoked eel. initial impression  like raisin from pine trees
7616,5027348,My favourite Portuguese wine to date.  Full of peaches and rich stone fruit but with a low acidity and alcohol level.  Intense flavours but a delicate and complex wine.  I will be adding this to my collection if I can find it.  Loved this Riesling and again adding to my belief that the days of Sauvignon Blanc are over......
7617,5027348,Good balance and fruity.
7618,5027348,Interesting and unusual Riesling from Portugal. Surprisingly high acidity and overall not a bad wine
7619,5027348,Kiwi and lemon with plenty acidity
7620,5027348,"This wine is I a dance! Starting somehow acidic and with rich citrus flavors and peach. Ending with a savory, salty, crusty palate and aftertaste, it is an explosion in your mouth. Trying to get to the vineyard and buy some. "
7621,5027348,"Beautiful light body, dry finish, and just enough flavor with hints of vanilla and green apple."
7622,5027348,sweet but subtle..

7626,75980,Fantastic - It's that simple!
7627,75980,"Late, but still powerful "
7628,75980,Never order only half a bottle of this one! It is simply not enough!! Deliciously crisp and aromatic with a sweet finish...I want more!!
7629,75980,"With a great perfume on the delightful nose, this offered tart cherries, dried prune, dusty earth , old wood spice , cedar and touches of veal leather and liquid orange blossom honey. A wine of great personality and remarkable maturity, medium- bodied with refined tannins and perfect harmony towards the lengthy spicy finish with sensations of sweet old balsamic vinegar . It  reminded me of a matured , lively Pauillac. An impressive example of the quality and age- worthiness of these old school wines!!"
7630,75980,"Brilliant Portuguese mature wine traditional blend TourigaNacional and Franca TintaRoriz and Barroca a deep garnet tint with pale brick shades Nose:intense, very ripe aromas, black fruit, plum, mulberry, juicy ripe cherry, fried blackberries as well as spices, balsamic, dried herbs, cedar and resin, tobacco, earthy tones Wine very well balanced, its bouquet is complex and intense, full body, large extract, smooth ripe tannins harmonizing with fleshy acidity Finish is very long, harmonious and unforgettable."

7633,75980,"Fruity, good value, easy to drink."
7634,75980,"This red by casa ferreirinha has always been one of my favorits. The reason... well much affordable than elder brothers Barca Velha and Reserva Especial.  This vintage, for instance, I bought at USD$ 65 a bottle. And let me tell you.. this one at this point of maturation is just as good as any Barca Velha I v had.  Fantastic red Cheers!"

7636,2283333, dark fruit blueberry blackberry plum oak tobacco cherry vanilla
7637,2283333,"Needs to develop a bit in the glass, but a lot of jam on the nose, not too spicy. "
7638,2283333,"Such a nice surprise.  Beautiful red blood colour that fits perfectly with the oaky, tobacco and dark berries on the nose, that are complemented with a lightness of the minerality it may show on the mouth.  The first impact is velvety, full flavoured pushing to the tongue all it showed on the nose. Transitions beautifully on the mid palate to a mineral and tannic touch that persists without being overwhelming to a long finish.  Beautiful wine that I advise with a good plate of food."
7639,2283333,"Love this beautifully balanced, complex nose - earthy notes blended with black currant and raspberry, with hints of licorice, cinnamon, leather. Palate echoes the nose, medium body, very long lasting with a very interesting finish, like asparagus or something green. Overall a very nice wine for this price, give it time to open, it really changes quite a bit"
7640,2283333,Medium body and very flavorful. Even wine by the glass is worth looking forward to in Porto.
7641,2283333,Great for red meats
7642,2283333,"Lovely balanced nose with black fruit and earthy notes. Citrus freshness on first taste, with tartness and tannins to follow. Upon first opening, a distinctive vegetal note comes in midway on the palate and persists through the finish, asparagus along with petroleum. This goes after 20 or so minutes of breathing, leaving a nicely balanced palate that also allows more space for the previously faint cinnamon and licorice. "

7652,1198393,"Still young with massive smells of raisins, nuts, vanilla and red berries. In the mouth it is velvety and concentrated and stays forever. Could have more complexity, but a lovely wine nevertheless."

7668,1504338,"Great bairrada from this small Quinta do Ortigão, very good and persistent nose, great tears, very velvet and balanced wine, the best I have ever had. Soft red berries, plums and light chocolate and very soft tannins. Do try because price quality is top "

7671,1504338,(3.0) Corked bottle review will follow on next bottle.
7672,1504338,"Interesting and bold, definitely not something to be consumed in a rush. Requires attention to changing tastes, gets better after an hour or so. Also, in the beginning is quite acidic as lots of Portuguese reds, but eventually this part gets nicely balanced. "
7673,1504338,"Finally a big gun comes out after so many other wines.. What a beauty! 👀Deep ruby in colour 👃Pronounced nose of blackberry, plum and black cherry with beautifully intertwined oaky vanilla with touches of raisin some crushed gravel 👄Pronounced on the palate with black fruit and sour cherry with some earthy minerality and big spice to a looooong finish. Luxurious and rich with big grumpy tannins and high acidity! 8 years young requiring another 15 at least! What a beast! 4.3🌟 and only getting better "
7674,1504338,"Very good this 2009 Limited Edition 4 dezasseis,this red wine is not a bit shy!It showed its might from the beginning with a tremendously deep garnet,almost opaque color.Lovely nose,a wine I can smell the whole day,notes of red ripe fruit,anise and licorice,slight white flower and wet earth.Full body with firm but polished tannins and good acid sting.A palate marked by quality fruit well integrated with wood,balsamic and menthol,spicy and jammy.The end is long marked by pleasant lingering acidity."

7679,1504338,"Heavy and ok nose for a Portugese Duoro, but little nuance and complexity"
7680,2631043,"Never tried this grape combination before. Light butter, lime, weirdly enough some garlic, but it works very well. Opened up after half an hour with more grapefruit and more butter."
7681,2631043,This was very fresh and light perfect with taco salad. But of course you expect that at €36 
7682,2631043,Best Portuguese white we had
7683,2631043,"Summer 2020 Peso da Régua,  Aneto restaurant. Very unusual white. Alvarinho,  verdelho and Encruzado 🍇 grapes. Nose is 🍎 🍏 apple like sidre. "
7684,2631043,"This is a white wine, not sure why so many people have reviewed this as a red? Golden in colour, aromas of sunflowers and apricots. Some tropical fruit notes for flavour with a fresh acidity. Semi dry finish with some lingering notes of lychee. Was nice!"
7685,2631043,"Revisiting the Aneto, triple local grapes, but not as amazed as before, a little thin around the waist that even slightly disturbing vanilla note on the nose - still a good wine but I have to retract my 4.5 from November🙄"
7686,2631043,"Excellent! Pale yellow color, citrus and mineral flavors, lovely acidity, medium finish.  Paired with tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella risotto.  Rate 3.8"

7688,2631043,"Beautiful golden yellow color. The aroma contains notes of citrus and minerals, mixed with aromas of spices and vanilla. The taste is very elegant, long and tender aftertaste."

7693,2631043,"Nice, dry and robust wine. Like their reds more, but it’s a good white! Notes of oak, cucumber, butter and citrus."
7694,2631043,"Great expression from Douro, this boutique winery knows what they are doing, very elegant wine, correct tannins, red fruit with vanilla notes, smooth."
7695,1368836,"Super smooth, well integragrated tannins, little chocolate, nice solo"
7696,1368836, Very good wine I enjoyed it in his bold taste with traces of so e oak vanilla and maybe dark chocolate...It is really excellent and I recommend it 
7697,1368836,"Deep colour. Heavy syrupy flavours. Too much in this Algarve heat. Also tastes slightly corky - in a good way, not corked. As if it were a more mature red. Probably not been stored well."
7698,1368836,Boa acidez. Final interessante.
7699,1368836,"Forgot about this one, unearthed it when reorganizing the wine fridge… What a discovery! ☺️😋  Nose with moist, fertile undergrowth, kirsch, black currant, prune, mokka and integrated oak followed by a very intense, powerful palate with perfect acidity, dry, constructive, bite size tannins, black cherry, black prune and black tea. Delicious, and for less than 20€ 😎! 4.4"
7700,1368836,"Nice light flavour easy to drink, smooth."
7701,1368836,"Dry, and oaky, great full flavor wine. Great with red meat and stong cheese."
7702,1368836,"Dark fruits, integrated oak and supple tannins. Surprising acidity that makes me think this could age for a good few years yet."
7703,1368836,A well worn sofa. Vanilla chocolate notes and a cookie finish. High alchohol and surprisingly low acidity. I'll be on the look out for more Herdade do Pombal.
7704,1368836,Let it breathe for a few minutes before drinking to get the best out of this wine.
7705,1368836,"4.2, Full bodied, dense and thick which makes it quite opaque in the glass. Looks almost unfiltered. It reminds me of the Saperavi from Gitana, it feels like biting into the grapes. It treats your 👅 with hints of Black currant and dark chocolate. On the 👃 it's chamomile. Delicious!"
7706,1368836,Flattish and slightly burning  Some good taste under that but overall disappointing 
7707,1368836,Great wine from the south of Portugal.  A good safe buy at the price.
7708,1368836,Excellent wine with good friends and fabulous food!

7719,8070285,"Portuguese wines evening. Elegant white, with notes of citrus, grapefruit, lime and tea leaf. In the mouth, very fresh, good complexity and bright acidity."
7720,8070285,"Despite having all the triggers in place, I previously have had issues with the shape of the acidity from this winery.  With this Reserva I’m beginning to understand that acidity to such unusually degree, for being Beira Interior, has made  me biased against it.  This acidity is outstanding for the region and despite my personal taste profile, it is an extremely well-made wine, maybe ecologically altering the profile what we can expect from this region in the future. Pls. Comment! "
7721,8070285,"Right acidity, full bodied. Citrus long finish"
7722,2582968,"Value Alentejano red. On the nose plum, black raspberry, sour cherry. On the palate medium acidity and mellow tannins. Tasted at Landers Pasig "
7723,2582968,"Third bottle - my first review. 3.7 Given the price point for a Vinho Original, an enjoyable Portuguese blend. Rather serious compared to the others I’ve tried. Medium purple color. Aromas and flavors of clove, red cherry, red raspberries, plum, cassis, violet and smoke.   Developing an interest and appreciation for Portuguese wines - need to get a case of these. Great for everyday relaxed drinking."
7724,2582968,Good wine for social drinking but a bit heavy
7725,2582968,Similar body to Malbec
7726,2582968, A fine medium bodied red

7728,2582968,"Easy, dry, great value "
7729,2582968,Portuguese are some of the best quality for money in the world. An amazing 8.00 red. Can open anytime and enjoy plum cherry and blackberry. 
7730,2582968, Black raspberry and plum evident.  Great length but otherwise lacking in other areas.
7731,2582968,"Bottle from Landers, QC. Plum, raspberry and cherry"
7732,2582968,"Soft, full, fruit-forward, deep raspberry and black raspberry.  Classic Alentejano.  Lovely!"
7733,2582968,A good wine.  Dry and intense.  On the nose some smoke touch.  Long on the palate.  Presents a good acidity level which makes it a good pair for meat with some degree of fat.  Good match for lamb or goat. 
7734,2582968,"Something’s off with this wine. Would be nice, perhaps just this bottle. But dark fruits and international sort, just missing the balance."
7735,2582968,"This is heading in the right direction . Better with food. A nose of cherry. Quite acidic in the tongue. Plum, blackberry, and some sour cherry on the finish. Lots of length. Will benefit from decanting and probably 5 more years in the cellar.   In the 2013 are Aragonez (60%), Alfrocheiro(20%) and Alicante Bouschet(20%)"
7736,2582968,Fairly dark and tannic. Even though it’s 5 years old I would wait another 3 to 5 years to drink or make sure I was having it with a creamy cheese. Black Raspberry fruit with a dusty chocolatey finish
7737,6244465,Unfortunately summer backlog;)
7738,6244465,"Nice salmon colour, intense on the nose fresh red fruit, dry, medium body and quite mineral with a persistent finish"
7739,6244465,"Enjoyed this zinger rosé yesterday. 😍Light salmon coloured. Notes of white peach, citrus and chalky minerality. Very long, lingering fruit finish. Nicely dry and the closest Portuguese rosé to a Provence-style. This wine was recommended by the wine guy of Garrafeira da Praia in Salema. Would love to try this again and directly compare it to a Tavel. Cheers 🥂 "
7740,6244465,Good light rose with peach and light citrus notes. 11.5% perfect for a hot summers day.
7741,6244465,"Nice Rosé from Dão! A light, crisp and aromatic Rosé, made from a blend of Touriga Nacional and Alfrocheiro, matured 4m in stainless steel vats. Fruity, elegant and slightly complex, with vivid acidity and great length. Pale pink color, floral, red fruits/berries aromas/flavors, specially cherry and strawberry, mineral with notes of citrus, spices and mint. Dry, creamy and fresh, with a juicy lingering finish. Pleasant and refreshing!"

7747,6244465,Priceless experience with the One
7748,6244465,"The first feature, a pale rose color. The aroma is mineral and fruity. In terms of flavor, the first thing I noticed was the acidity, must be enjoyed with food. It has a distinct flavor, strong and elegant ! "
7749,6244465,Dry of the french style. Excellent rose’
7750,6244465,"Fun, good and simpel "
7751,6244465,Looks great in the glass - pale but not blush pink. It is OK on the palette but has a hint of mustiness about it that gave it a stale aftertaste. Not enjoyable really
7752,5974326,"Intense and expresive aromas of red fruits, cherry, cranberry involved with fresh aromas of oak, vanilla, mushrooms and wild flowers. Well integrated tannins, pleasant acidity, good structure and medium long finish"
7753,5974326,"Fresh, good acidity, pairs very well with meat despite of not being a full body wine. The only defect is some sweetness who makes it a more comercial wine."
7754,5974326,Lively Riesling with red fruit and good balance. Cranberry and citrus grapefruit. Nice with an octopus 🐙 salad.

Amazing!!!😊 Fantastic forever lasting nose predominant of freshly baked waffles, dense yogurt, caramel, ripe flowers and whiff of crushed fennel.

Persistent and complex aroma of ripe white fruits, dried peaches & wild flowers, autolytic notes, toast, hint of yoghurt, fennel and tar. Concentrated and focused palate with creamy texture of Chardonnay goes in harmony with PN fruitiness and mineral, yeasty hints, crisp well pronounced acidity and lengthy finish. Cheers to @[1|9772520|Gintaras P.] for sharing this gem!"
7770,1304979,"Portuguese Sparkling - mandatory Regional Style  Can't understand why there's no actual Vivino Regional Style for 'Portuguese Sparkling'. Spain alone has 'Spanish Sparkling' and 'Cava' as 2 official sparkling Styles. It does not make sense, my Friends. Unless local Sparkling producers are against it, for some reason. Drinking this amazing Pinot Noir - Chardonnay exquisite sparkling, is a unique privilege: Spiral shaped bubbly flow  Carrying sunset shades of matured orchard  Zesty, Dry, Rich. Mealy. Cult."

Confirmed by a bunch of people that helped me to go through the marathon of bd events & 35°C heat. Light, crispy, bubbly though solid, complex&meditational. Didn't have enough time for a detailed N&P surgery but it's simply awesome with yogurt, caramelized vaffles, lime. Hints of goosberries, green herbs, stone fruit&apples. Balanced, dry, youthful acidity (13yo youngster), savory cream&fresh fruitness. ⬇️⬇️⬇️"

7807,1136261,"Good port with notes of prune, raisin, vanilla, walnut, dried fig, brown sugar, oak and chocolate."
7808,1136261,"Pocas still use foot treading for their Colheita tawnies, with the juice aged in old 625l Portuguese oak barrels. This 1997 is quite woody and spicy. Loads of fruit and flavour, prune and fig richness cut by citrus peel. Tobacco, leather, vanilla. Good length. Very high acidity, but it works in combination with the confident, generous style. Full of personality, and well-priced. I find Pocas a bit hit and miss; this one is a hit 🍷👍"
7809,1136261,"A delightful and elegant 1967 with the classic profile of Pocas 🤩🍷 complexity, freshness and nice power 💥 "
7810,1136261,"Dark tawny colour, dried red fruit, oak, vanilla, fig, prune, and raisin, some tobacco smoke, warming but not hot, intense and lingering sweetness. Nice tawny for the money."
7811,1136261,"Lovely, gentle port. Light and mellowed well. The colour is a lighter rouge than younger ages. The port bursts with brown sugar and treacle "

7815,3751066,Lovely cold and crisp on a warm evening
7816,3751066,"Although not outstanding, it is a great example of a Bairrada white wine (home). Well balanced with two of the most characteristic grapes of the region. Good acidity (citric) and vigorous body. Nice aroma with a subtle wood. Long pleasant aftertaste."
7817,3751066,"A fantastic white wine, dry but complex with structure.  Vanilla, 🍐 . A wine that for his price range is very good. This winemaker produces great wines, special sparkling wine. It deserves a taste."

7822,3751066,"extra dry, this Chablis type of wine is mineral with wooden and citrus notes. Perfectly balanced acidity, it's a great surprise."
7823,3751066,Acidic on the finish
7824,3751066,"Dried flowers on the nose, fruity bouquet, smooth mineral palate, great balance with nice finale. Beautiful."
7825,3751066,Decent wine - crisp and not too sweet. Bit overpriced where we got it though.
7826,3751066,Nice light white with buttery tastes. Minerals and fresh. 
7827,1435733,"Intense ruby color with violet rim reflections. Expressive and elegant notes of ripe black fruit like blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and lovely aromas of violet, eucalyptus and prune mixed with tobacco leaves, cigar box and spices like cedar and licorice. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. Full bodied, balanced, vibrant acidity and long finish."

7838,2773068,Very unusual. Smells like banana. Tastes almost spirit like. Dry and mineral finish. Would recommend. 
7839,2773068,Nice grapes. A “sea side” white.
7840,2773068,Very limited production - amazing aroma of minty chocolate . Tasted with Lab menu . Creamy texture - 
7841,2773068,"Yellow, greenish color, with moderate acidity. Good flavors and aromas of citrus fruit. Lots of strong oak notes. In terms of smell and taste, it is a pleasant white from Palmela region, for those who enjoy extremly oaked wine  (which is not really my case. I didn't appreciate it very much).         Contains sulphites. 13,5.º alcoholics."
7842,2773068,We must find a case of this for our cellar.  Great with prawns for a lazy summer lunch. 
7843,2773068,"Golden color, tears, mainly citrus on the nose. Some tannins and long intense taste of minerals and yeast.   We had a fish soup today but this is probably even better with shellfish. And also great with cheese. A nice encounter with an old friend, we had this at a wine & food pairing a year ago.  "
7844,2773068,"As good a wine as we have had in many months. Toasted almonds. Sesame(?). Savoury, oily and salty. Reminiscent of hot stones on a sidewalk. "
7845,2773068,"High praise to the Simões family! Boal or it’s real name Malvasia, in this case comes from very old wines. The work in the winery with fermentation and barrel storage has paid of well. Almost an aromatic feel, medium long excellent texture!"
7846,2773068,"Really really good. The almonds and marmalade are well balanced with acidity, but the star of the show is the ultra smooth creamy vanilla. Like cream soda, but with class. Beautiful balance and very good with seafood."
7847,2773068,"Great white wine,this 2013 has a dark yellow to golden color,aromas are absolutely yummy,vanilla and ripe quince,honey,apricot and oak!The mouth is presented with top notch acidity,a buttery feel!Barrel integration on the upside,this one will not be for everyone!Can be a good winter white wine,for me it's just perfect!Cheers."
7848,2773068,"Superior wine, rich nose and taste; fine structure en developed colour as one can expect from Boal. A joy to have in the glass. "
7849,2773068,"Lemoncurd, minerals and subtile acids. Green leaves. Dry. "
7850,2773068,"Among the really best Whites ever, full-bodied, splendid"
7851,2773068,A deep sage with butter. Definitely polished and long lasting. The tannins are a supple mixture both front and back of mouth. Pair with octopus salad.
7852,2387033,"Very good blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz from Douro Quinta de Santiago. This 2016 crop is fine to drink and has aromas of pine tree, mild spices and tobacco. "

7854,2387033,Fragrance of orange peel. Delicious acidity.  Jen loved it in Porto 
7855,2387033,Great wine for reasonable price @ BH Foz in Porto
7856,2387033,"Fine wine from Douro. Spicy, predictable and light enough to be easy to drink. Although, a very good cost x benefit."

7861,2387033,Julie red douro
7862,2387033,Very good.  Perfectly fine with fish and risotto.  We loved it. 
7863,2387033,"Don't be fooled by this being about the only Douro wine in a burgundy bottle. It was pretty weak, although it was better after about 30 minutes.. All in all not bad for the price but stick to the Riservas. "
7864,2387033,A bit of a waiting process. As I drank it with. My meal if became more velvety. A nice taste of spice with a good finish. 
7865,2387033,"Deep dark colour. You can savour prune, black berries and some oak with a velvity finish. Quite conforting for a cold night! "
7866,2387033,Good value wine 
7867,2258813,"Red-brown colour. Nice sweet dried fruity nose. Dates, figs, dried apricot and raisins. Lovely balanced. Nice vanilla flavours. Soft mouthfeel yet grippy. Good stuff. DALVA MEETS STAR WARS by the way."
7868,2258813,"Colheita on the other side, means that the grape used to produce the port are all from the same vintage. It also needs a longer barrel ageing process to deserve the appellation.   Stronger and deeper than LBV, the robe is also thicker, and darker. Caramel, coffee, oak and cherries are the most eminent flavours this port wine offers."
7869,2258813,"Simple, nuttiness no added sugar with great fruit balance. Delicious finish. Nice Porto with perfect lasting toasted caramel."
7870,2258813,"A nice one! Plums and cherries with oak on the nose, Smooth fruity palate with plums and figs. Pepper opens up ""en route.""  Prolonged warm finish. "
7871,2258813,"Port Wine Christmas Calendar 4/12/2020. Today’s port is a Colheita aka a single harvest Tawny port. Bottled in 2020, so aged for 16 years on oak barrels. Served at 14°. Lovely light brown color, like watery coffee. Exciting nose with caramel, brown candy sugar, toasted almonds, honey, some baking spices, dried fruits with figs and raisins and a nice medicinal touch with orange peel.
 On the palate sweet with fine acidity and quite the finish with nice herbal bitternes! Underrated imo. 4.1 😍"
7872,2258813,"Nice brown almost Coffey like color, at hint of orange in the nose. The taste Is full fat and very pleasant . It taste of Dried fruits, nuts, caramel."
7873,2258813,"A very nicely ages portwine. Espresso, roasted walnuts, cherry, fig. Very nicely balanced with still some sweetness. "
7874,2258813,Smooth af. Some berries and soil and a lot of plums. Needs air to fully open up.
7875,2258813,"Caramel, raisin, nuts. No surprise "
7876,2258813,Really nice Colheita from Dalva 2004 so nice and intense. 👍🍷🍷🍷🍷

7879,2258813,No notes taken.
7880,2258813,"Port wine Christmas calendar 2020 4 December. A Colheita tawny port wine from a single harvest year, this baby is from 2004, aged at least 7 years (minimum) on oak barrels. This one is bottled in 2020 so 16 years on oak. 20% alcohol.   Dark golden brown. Rich bold nose and palate with notes of dried fruits, touch of spices raisin honey almond caramel orange zest licorice cinnamon fig tobacco toast. An elegant balanced palate with a pleasant freshness in the taste. Long and lasting aftertaste. "
7881,2258813,Great port! Super smooth and tasty 
7882,6913897,Very nice. Excellent acidity and tannins balance. 
7883,6913897,Still the same opinion of a year ago! 
7884,6913897,Delicious... unbelievably taste. 
7885,6913897,"Not too dry, soft. "
7886,4709487,"3.8.   Tart Grapefruit, very refreshing.  "
7887,4709487,"Fresh and fruity with hints of grapefruit and green apple . Dry but not acidic, easy to drink, and good quality! "
7888,4709487,"Is soldaten as a sweet wine, especially adjusted for blue cheeses, but I didn't find this sweet at all. Rather tight even with in the beginning some apricot, immediately followed by green apple and only a very small touch of muscat. Probably because the grapes are cultivated at 600 m height. Simple, not complex but decent."
7889,4709487,Delicious aromatic dry Moscatel from Portugal. 
7890,4709487,Surprisingly fresh and dry
7891,1172508,"A year later this vintage improved a lot. Cranberries became a lot stronger, love the dried red fruits. Paired with a Greek lasagna, absolutely worthwhile"
7892,1172508,"I can't agree with the majority on this one. I'm ^^ from a 3. Very dark garnet, with purple rim. Dark brooding nose with blackberry, cedar and old tobacco pouch. Smooth, earthy palate, medium+ bodied and a solid finish. Flavours of black plum, oak, more tobacco and blackberry.  3.5 JH points, pretty good for sub $10"
7893,1172508,"What to expect of this excellent qpr wine? Maturing on oak is minimal, less third aroma’s. Mixture of fruit and tannibs with a medium acidity. During weekdays a perfect alternative!"
7894,1172508,"🌍 Typical red Douro, ranging from 3 to 3.5. Objectively slightly waterish, poor structure.   On the other hand, it tastes very positive, with a large explosion of fruit on the tongue and palate made with notes of plum & blackberries, some oak and tobacco.  Sharp.   🇵🇱 Typowe czerwone Douro, waham się między 3 a 3,5. Obiektywnie nieco rozwodnione, słaba struktura. Z drugiej strony smakowo bardzo pozytywnie, z dużą eksplozją owocu na języku. Paleta: śliwka i jeżyny, trochę dębu i tytoniu. Ostre.  3.2"
7895,1172508,Let it breathe for 10 or 15 minutes first. Then it presents a lively fruity flavor with a tannic background. The flavor is pleasant with a fruity characteristic that's different from other red wine fruitiness.
7896,1172508,Style102. Not the best example from the Douro (had much better when visited a few years back). This young brash and not well balanced. Oh well let’s try something else!
7897,1172508,"It incorporates the douro spirit. Well balanced, fig, musky with a touch of plum. A weak aftertaste. "
7898,1172508,Dark and Rich berry  Decent complex structure mouth And then another
7899,1172508,Paint stripper. But sometimes only paint stripper will do.
7900,1172508,It’s got no guts
7901,1172508,"Juicy, fruity and with some notes of oak, and a somewhat acid ending. Nothing special. "
7902,1172508,Tried this in Real Fado in Porto n thought it was ok not too bad. Not as flavorful but ok
7903,1172508,Beautiful wine from Douro’s vineyards ! Soft and Smooth flavor !  
7904,1172508,I think I’ve found my go-to grape. Lovely 
7905,1172508,Worth every penny! Small price but a big taste. I’m going to order a case when it becomes available in the states.
7906,1322600,"94/100 Good bottle age on this beauty from Crasto. Notes of tomato, cherry, tobacco, cedar, and basalmic notes. Incredibly complex nose. Full in body with a ton of life left. Mouth coating tannin. "
7907,1322600,"Bright intense ruby color. Ripe black fruit aroma with dark chocolate, herbs, spices, fumé, oak, liquorice, toasty notes, light balsamic. Extremely complex with pretty nice structure, creamy and textured, soft tannins well integrated. Concentrated, full bodied and good acidity gives high potential for aging. Long and fascinating finish. Great Wine !"
7908,1322600,"Douro tasting. WOTN. Exceptional douro red. Blackberries, cassis, plums, caramelidized elements and dark chocolate on nose. Nose was at first shy but opened nicely. Good acidity and balanced tannins on palate. Fullbodied and especially long fruity finish. Excellent structure and balance. Maybe the best Quinta de Crasto ( along QdC tinta roriz v 2011) I have tasted."
7909,1322600,Excellent! Nice body. Intense ruby. Very tasty.
7910,1322600,"Simply perfect, full of leather, dark berries, little spicy, unbelievable after taste"
7911,1322600,"What a spectacular blockbuster! Huge,dark, ten years before its prime but already approachable this delight has dark fruit in abundance, high alcohol,(admits to 15%) and a brooding nose. Have it on a cold wet winter's night and come to terms with the season."
7912,1322600,"Just wow, 2010 douro, great full body, Smooth with a hint of vanilla and plum"
7913,1322600,"Top du top. Floral, fruit, long, magnifique"
7914,1322600,Needs a bit more body
7915,1322600,Stunning cherry flavours. Deep and rich.
7916,1322600,"dark red in the glass with a flowery bouquet, excellent balance in the mouth, and a loooong finish! Who could ask for anything more? This definitely is in my top ten list!"
7917,1322600,"Top of top!!!!  👁 red deep wine with purple  Round and large drop.  👃🏻Black fruits and woods, cherry oaked and caramel   👅must take it"
7918,1322600,"Why talk about what I smell: raspberries, strawberry, mushrooms, leather, green pepper etc etc. What I smell, you don't smell. The smell that I smell today will change over the next months or years. I prefer to focusing on the history of the producer, understand the place where it's made, and how it was done. Appreciating the wine with the right food pairing and the enjoying the special moments the wine is creating is what truly connects people.     "
7919,1322600,This wine now in my top ten list of all time.  Amazing opportunity.  Black fruits and herbs balanced perfectly.  The finish never seems to end.  Wow wine.
7920,1322600,"Amazing, fresh Portuguese red with rich red fruit and chocolate and smooth tannins. From old vines. "
7921,1259564,"Dry, mineral yet with a hint of floral notes"
7922,1259564,"A 1995 vintage. Slight oxidized notes on the nose with some candied fruit notes. Rich up front with assertive acidity. This wine has some great aged notes, very good! Similar to a Lopez de Heredia wines."
7923,1259564,Well blended 2009 northern red reserve
7924,1259564,Dark ruby ​​color.  Aroma of black forest fruit with some balsamic notes.  In the mouth is intense with good structure.  Elegant wine with a medium and pleasant finish.
7925,1259564,One of my favorite Winery in the Bairrada region. Still young wine but expressive with character and personality 
7926,1259564,"Oak, chocolate, dark fruit, plum, tobacco  Greta!  🗺 Region: Bairrada, Portugal 🇵🇹 🍇 Grapes: Touriga nacional, Baga, Cabernet sauvignon ⌚️ Vintage: 2016 🏰 Winery: Sao Joao"
7927,1259564,"Bovino, off menu. Really nice"
7928,1259564,Fantastic Bairrada gem. Lots of fruits and freshness. Vanilla and casked oak. Even a hint of port berries. Would recommend plenty of air-time before serving.
7929,1259564,"Aging beautifully, rich dried fruit notesare alive and well after 21 years, along with a slightly candied note, which could as easily be a reflection of storage as of age, but it's enjoyable, so no worries there. Raisins, prunes, caramel, almost creme caramel, nutmeg. Great length, amazing value. I'm thinking about buying a few more bottles, at least one to lay down for a decade."
7930,1259564,"Repeat tasting and similar notes. In the glass it has an opaque garnet-ruby core with mahogany reflections and a brick orange rim. The nose took me straight to Barolo with notes of cherry, black raspberry, cacao, leather, cedar and underbrush. At 24 years of age, the palate shows impressive structure, with still present tannins and a lifted finish.i drank this immediately after the 1985 Barolo on Saturday and they were strikingly similar. A fantastic wine and high QPR. "
7931,1259564,Encorpado com pouca acidês  Frutado e com final prolongado
7932,1259564,"Only God knows where and why a winery keeps a wine for 24 years then decides to release it.  Anyway, this Bairadda wine is a gem. Ruby/garnet with a touch of Browning on the rim. Packed full of dusty, mineral, fruit of the forest,  bramble,  spice, wood and cigar. Good tannins are still holding firm. I would guess this is 10 years old if tasted blind. "
7933,1259564,"Deep purple colour with ripe fruit aroma,  Fine acidity with round tanins and full bodied with medium finish."
7934,1259564,"The oldest wine I’ve ever had, amazing that 30 years later there’s still plenty of life. Couldn’t recommend more. "
7935,1259564,A blend of local grapes with baga being the hero. Pouring beautifully still fresh with great balance
7936,3127783,Wonderfully dry with an almost tartness to go song with a mineral richness. Just a hint of butteriness. Pairs fabulous with seafoods. 
7937,3127783,Fresh fruity and such a spoil. 
7938,3127783,"Firstly, I can’t believe this wine would sell at Euro 3.- as Vivino says. Secondly, I was not as convinced as many others, somehow it didn’t work for me. Maybe it was the food even though it shouldn’t be since the waiter recommended it.. 🧐"
7939,3127783,"NICE BLEND   This Blanc Reserva was blended with 5 grape varieties, end result was a very decent effort, I quite enjoyed it.   Nose of almonds and soap. Palate surprised me to be a Demi-Sec wine, almost like a Ygrec from d'Yquem or G de Guiraud), moderately sweet but definitely not Bortrytis style Sauternes sweetness. Quite enjoyable and chewy. I liked it that it easily melted on the palate style. "
7940,3127783,Just enough oak for me. Complex yet fresh. .
7941,3127783,"Citrus dry, smooth finish  great Alvarinho"
7942,3127783,"Citrus and lemongrass, easy drinking value bottle. "
7943,3127783,"Citrus, green apple, green pear, minerals, lime, grapefruit, medium+ acidity, slightly hazy, fermented with wild yeast."
7944,3127783,Soft pineapple. Lovely. 
7945,3127783,"3.7 A 🇵🇹 white blend of Rabigato, Viosinho, and Malvasia Fina.   Lemon yellow in the glass.   Spicy lime zest, white flowers, a bit of cedar closet and racey, bright acidity.   Simple and refreshing."
7946,3127783,"Pale straw. Bright citrus nose. Dry, light body, high acid. The nose carries to the big citrus flavours, and a hint of vanilla on the long finish. The acid is big but reined in to a decent bright Douro wine. "
7947,3127783,Good aroma and nice with fish
7948,3127783,"👁 clear yellow  👃🏻 citrus, pear, fresh fruity 👅 acidic but still fresh and a good mellow mouthfeel  Tasting this wine as a starter in Madeira with greate friends🍇"
7949,3127783,Good with pecorino cheese 
7950,3127783,Very dry. Heavy on citrus
7951,1279000,"With Marcio and Alessandra. This is a very good product, well packed with tannins, acidity and fruit at the right place. Very good wine. 95 RP."
7952,1279000,"94 rating! Smooth and elegant with great structure and lots of fruit. Blueberries, blackberries, plum and cedar dominate the palate. Fantastic."
7953,1279000,"Excellent wine Structured, smooth with nice acidity, very elegant fruitiness with taste of cedar, ripe strawberries and bramble. Mature but still developing. Field blend, approximately 30 different types of grapes approx 120 years old vines. Every single bottle has been tasted and re-corked. "
7954,1279000,"Phenomenal. Brown purple in colour. A great evolution with time as the nose at first presented an aroma of ripe or even rotten apples which then evolved into vanilla, tobacco spice &wood. In mouth it displayed nothing but elegance. Thin &silky. Super sophisticated. Explosion of fruits, then earthy notes, then vanilla in a massive show of complexity. Fairly short finish with firm tannins which clung onto my teeth very heavily. After an hour or two they softened into pure silk. Fine acidity with lush texture."
7955,1279000,"A vertical tasting of this small Douro Fojo winery. This 2001 vintage still has a quite clear rubi red color. Moderately intense red fruit aromas with notes of sweet chocolate, liquorice and vanilla, which are short lasting in the glass. Medium-bodied (14.0%), very well-balanced Portuguese wine with nice acidity and alcohol. Tannins are lively, smooth and rounded, leaving a strong, bold, lightly sweet and persistent finish. A 90-GB pts very nice wine."
7956,1279000,"Delicious, rich with ripe red berries "
7957,1279000,This was a fiiine Douro. Rich and bouncy. 
7958,1279000,Lush on palate and finish 
7959,1279000,"Good, somewhat subtle Douro. Mature, ready. RP 95, but do not follow RP drink-window advice. Then again, less than 7K bottles so..,"
7960,1279000,"Full bodied, nicely balanced.   Rich deep flavor, fruity and nicely tannic.   Purchased at Astor Center, New York City. "
7961,1279000,A turned violet Portuguese Douro with a subtle nose on berries. It is generous and firm with proper acidity. Inspire of its age it could still go to the cellar for another decade. 
7962,1279000,"At 18 years from vintage, this one has already peaked and is headed into decline. Drink it now! Enjoyed in Terceira Island while out to dinner with family. Would be 4.5, but dropped.5 due to partial decline."
7963,1279000,Lovely aged red wine—tastes like a port but more of a table wine. Smooth and perfect with spicy steak!
7964,1279000,Excellent. Slightly confusing re the price though. We paid around 45 euros in a good Portuguese restaurant compared to the average price suggestion of £55 retail. At our price it is fantastic value for a superbly smooth and tannin free medium bodied wine with a decent aftertaste and good length on the palate. I will look out for this wine whenever in Portugal 
7965,1279000,"Fantastic food-friendly aged wine, striking a balance between obvious tertiary and secondary aromas, and black fruit still fresh, thin yet elegant, and almost silky. At 14% alcohol, it does not overpower the flavors."
7966,1252796,"Developing aroma of plum, blue berry, dry fig, prune, nutmeg, pepper and chocolate. Medium ruby color. Dry, medium plus acidity, medium tannin, medium plus body, intensity and finish. Drink now and has potential for ageing. "

7980,1252796,"2 hour decant. Rich purple - nice legs - thin nose - some interesting flavours in here that it's hard to describe - some background of red cherry - light and fresh, but not in any way fragile - lot of grip, some sour - long finish - decent value under 20 euros."
7981,1415543,"Very good balance, Great acidity, very drinkable and just properly structured. Beautiful delicate fruit, very good wine. Will continue to age but is drinking very well now."

7983,1415543,Peppery and rich! Good for stake and on its own.
7984,1415543,Not an easy drinking wine. A lot of tannins and heavy. Taste is absolutely not bad but after one glass you start longing for something smoother
7985,1415543,Purple extracted color- 90%extracted with great clarity.  18 months barrel time . Cocoa and earth - round palate - smooth and lengthy elegance. Not overpowering - very nice bottle.

7987,1415543,"Pretty color, aroma with good style, vigorous. Still a little closed but promising enough, with fruit and with good quality. Very balanced in the mouth, body, acidity and fruit in good dialogue. The wine will be good companion to table now. Strength without tiring is the motto."

Clean, medium plus intensity aroma of blackberry, leather, game, orange peel and stone. Dry, high acidity, medium plus tannins, full body and medium finish. Palate confirms the nose and adds salinity and leather. Well balanced, pans excellent quality. Sampled at Grand Tour, Miami Beach, May 10, 2019. "
8001,1612824,"Great bold red from Lisbon region.  Nose is amazing full of dry herbs, black fruit and oak. Full bodied but  still quite elegant and rounded tannins, a real gastronomical wine ideally for stronger dishes. Well done !"

8007,1612824,"Started with local wine in Lisbon. 40/30/30 Tinto Roriz, Turiga Nacional and Syrah. Winemaker: Sandra Tavares da Silva. 20 month in French barrics. New for sure... Smells with a strong sweet vanilla.  In the mouth perfume-like notes, some jamy black fruits and overripe raspberry, suppressed by powerful vanilla. Tannins are presented, level of acidity is enough, but all of it a bit disassembled and chaotic. Finish quite long with same perfume notes and some bitterness. Upd: several hours of aeration ->>>"
8008,1612824,"Garnet color. Full-bodied, medium dry, with medium acidity. It has several aromas and flavors, rich, fruity and woody. Notes such as red fruit, black fruit, oak, chocolate. Closed. Pleasant. In a 360º view, it's essential to talk about 2 classics of my thoughts on wines: the label announces the controversial sulfites (because they are commented by science and consumers as toxic) and alcohol at the level of 14°, which is too much for table wine, constituting a less gastronomic aspect."
8009,1612824,"What a great wine, goes perfectly with arroz de pato!"
8010,1612824,"Clean. Being on the threshold to maturity provides some good background buzz, however, the wine is astringent and fresh. "

First thing is oak - beautifully integrated vanilla, hazelnut, toast & butterscotch. Creamy & buttery. Tropical fruit (pineapple).

8016,2347859,"3.75 Fatty, unctuous ripe melon and plasticine aromas.  50:50 barrel:stainless steel fermented.  Much milder than a Burgundy (a style to which it was compared) with just  as kiss of oak.  Barrel fermentation gives it more texture and a yoghurty lees flavour.  High acidity.  Loses character with cheese. "

8054,1127986,Lovely in many ways with some of the classical port wine notes and tastes. But it did miss some finesse and had a bit too much acid at the end. And the wishfull pleasent long aftertastes was missing. But at the price the port wine was pretty okay.

8071,2837331,Tried in six senses - delicious 
8072,2837331,"Great. This is not your light vinho verde. Not so aromatic, but rather powerful and dry. Fresh cut wood, guava, lemon, stone. Not something you see everyday, but useful for plenty of food options. Enjoyed. "

8074,2837331,Aged fruit delight
8075,2837331,nutty and gentle

8079,2837331,It was ok but the wine was served to cold in ice water. When the wine was served at 10-12 C it opened.  Paid 25€ for a bottle.

8082,1289449,"Soft balanced and Bordeaux style wine...  Do not expect  a long and heavy battle with tannins and dark ripe red fruits,  but yes a nice  valse,  with a twist of Salsa...  How  is it possible,  try this wine and you  will understand..."

8086,1289449,"Heavenly wine, beautiful color, nice bouquet in the nose, chocolate and berry tastes, stays long in the aftertaste. Goes well with game and spicy dishes. "
8087,1289449,"This is a blend of 50% Touriga Nacional, 30% Touriga Franca and 20% Tinta Roriz. Half of the juice was aged for one year in used 500-liter French barrels; the other half in new 500-liter French barrels for six months. This adds extra aromatic appeal, and more importantly, it shows a bit more power, with a more serious backbone and a well balanced finish. It is graceful, smooth and very flavourful. "
8088,1289449,"Earth, black fruit and aroma on nose. Lifted black fruit, some spice, elegant. Very good depth of flavours leads to a drying long finish."
8089,1289449,This is beautifully balanced with dark black and blueberry.  Love it and will be back to duoro region again and again
8090,1289449,"Interesting to compare Reserva (3y in the cradle) vs Grand Reserva (5y). Same v.good vintage '15, same grapes (3xT). This one's still a wild mustang though growing, layering, pleasing. Opaque ruby, viscous, violet rims at abv.14%. After 6h aeration developing bouquet of rubber, patrol, fresh rose petal, jasmin, toasted oak, bramble, dried plum, fresh leather, moss. P: muscular body tough plushy finale, firm tannins, juicy acidity, formating length. Nice now. Potential for next decade. 3,7-3,8."

8094,1289449,Full body very good
8095,1289449,Good quality for price  Nice balance of the three grapes Needs a bit more time Earthiness with dark berries flavours.  Lovely aromas 
8096,1289449,Opaque ruby colour. Aromas of red fruit and toast. A wine dominated by its tannins with a woody flavour and later on a earthy palate. Possibly could have waited to be opened I suppose.
8097,7449829,Wow! Full on the nose with aged cherry and blackberry. Similar powerful mouth filling flavors on the tongue. Good fruit and mild tannins with a smooth finish. A most enjoyable wine. Excellent value for money.  
8098,7449829,"88/100 A blend of Syrah, Alicante Bouschet, and Touriga Nacional aged in oak for 9 months. There’s a lot of wood here but the fruit is plush enough to take it. Tobacco, meat, black raspberry, Firm tannins. The wood comes on a bit strong here."
8099,7449829,"Bouquet is very Mediterranean. Ripe blackberries,  blackcurrents ,cedar and hint of leather. Vibrant with a medium to bold body. Soft tannin and acidity. "

8101,7449829,Blackberry cherry beautiful. Top class rich red. 
8102,7449829,"Very alcoholic smoky nose! Clearly needs to breath after opening. The wine is smooth with strong tanins, leather. A chocolate finish. I don't agree with the label on the dark berries. Pleasant wine, well elaborated but for me a bit flat body where i cannot distract from the alcohol."
8103,7449829,Very smooth with strong blackberries flavours
8104,7449829,"Good god it was awful muddy, hangover juice. And it wasn't a poor way it was stored - room temp, cold, chilled, frozen - no improvement. It might be good for cooking, but the poor chicken you're putting in the vin might throw itself off the table before it reaches the oven. "
8105,7449829,Beautifully balanced with soft but complex and comforting  tannins with depth of colour and mouthwatering berries and perfect acidity. Interesting grape blend works well with the wood barrel ageing. the 2013 vintage just becoming ready to enjoy now but will last for a few years yet. P very gown up wine for the price...
8106,7449829,Deep bold flavourful red. Really like it on its own. Room temp is perfect! Love this one. Will want to buy it again. 
8107,7449829,Cooler climate wine. This shows. Elegant. Lovely. Faultless. Like a great northern rhone at half the price.

8114,1184243,"I am not good at holding wines for long:) This one was bought 1 year ago on Azores - fantastic blend! Prunes, cherry, medium tannis, really nicely balanced. Big Like!"
8115,1184243,"Wonderful ruby color. It is quite unbelievable, but I have felt in the nose some racino, berries and peach compote. Very good ending, acidity and typical Douro taste on the palate"
8116,1184243,75/100 @ yeatman christmas wine experience
8117,1184243,"Frutoso, tom de madeira e toque baunilha. Final pleno."
8118,1184243,Light golden colour.  Wonderful nose Almond shimmers through lightly. Sugarish.  Liquer with a lot of Acidity.  Lime.  Minerals. All together nice build and finish. After a little breather this wine is even better do not serve too cold.. I like a lot.
8119,1184243,"Good acidity, still fruity"
8120,1184243,Bold and fruity. Classic Portuguese wine lacking a good long aftertaste and flavour 
8121,1184243,"2 hour decant. Just starting to brick - significant acid and tannins, but, sadly, not quite the depth of fruit to back it up - I think this has past its best."
8122,1184243,"Not worth the price. A good wine, but too bad for this price range. "
8123,1964473,Nicely aged. Do not believe it has much left.
8124,1964473,Seriously good! Wip
8125,1964473,"T.Nacional + T.Roriz.  Aroma intenso, muito agradável: notas florais, fruta madura, cacau.. Em boca é encorpado, estruturado, aveludado, com muita fruta madura, notas de fumados, especiarias, chocolate... boa acidez... muito bom!...  Blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. Intense aroma, very pleasant: floral hints, ripe fruit, cocoa... In the palate it is full-bodied, well structured, velvety, plenty of ripe fruit with notes of smoke, spices, chocolate... very good acidity... very good wine!... "
8126,1964473,"Brilliant intense dark ruby red color. Pronounced and complex aromas of  beautiful ripe fruits: blackcurrants, raspberries; prunes, very fresh in vegetal notes, herby, peppery, spicy and floral complexity. Full-bodied,  cigar box nuances, fumé with beautiful acidity, firms, rounded and silky tannins, balanced with very fine and long finish (patina and taste)."
8127,1964473,"Madeira, halos violáceos. Rubi intenso. Frutos do bosque. Vinho intenso, "
8128,1964473,"Excellent! Round, but complex. Amazing aroma, plums and vanilla."
8129,1964473,"Wines from Portugal, June 7 - wine fair - only rating. Terrific Dāo!  Rate 4.3"
8130,1964473,Frutado encorpado e com final 
8131,1175940,Medium body but very good to excellent length with bright berries and licorice notes. Excellent value wine.
8132,1175940,"a nice coupage of 5 tipical portughese variety , perfect integrated"
8133,1175940,"Recommended Douro from the new wine shop at Pine Cliffs. Quite heavy and a lot of fruit. Strong blackberry and Liquorice, quite over bearing and alcoholic at 14%. Fat on the tongue, not a easy quaffing wine.  "
8134,1175940,Very interesting wine from Douro region with greats winemakers from Dão (birthplace of Touriga Nacional) - Lucia Freitas and Carlos Lucas.
8135,1175940,Very good  Smothered and soft in mouth.
8136,1175940,"Dry, very intensive, prefect balance"
8137,1175940,Paid $15 for it and it drank great! If you can find a bottle go for it!
8138,1175940,Smoky big red from Douro valley. Loads of tannin that coats your mouth. Deep dark red that allows very minimal light to go through. Full body experience that lingers with leather and black fruit. Look forward to pair it with beef steak or BBQ ribs.
8139,1175940,"For my Madison people, this bottle is only $5 at ULiq #value. Solid Portuguese red that reminds me of a Rioja. Cherry, vanilla, peppery aftertaste. Nice and dry. 🔒"
8140,1175940,"The volatile acidity was very prominent for the first little while but 10 minutes of breathing reveals a nice fruity and structured wine. Lots of fresh dark fruit, a bit of green pepper, and some floral notes."
8141,1175940,Powerful  red. Lots of fruit
8142,1175940,"My rating 3,8 . Cc"
8143,1175940,Extremely deep burgundy colour. Nose hard to assess as wine quite cool. Nose shows complex fruits on good balance not overpowering. Palate is very lively fruit with good acid soft lasting tannins and a long soft finish Lovely wine for its price
8144,1175940,"I'm a big fan of the 2014 vintage of this wine and have a random 2017 bottle amidst other vintages so gave it a go. While it's not as oaky as the 2014 and maybe needs to age a bit, it is very pleasant. Opens up quite nicely and the initial acidity turns into mellow tobacco and chocolate notes. Soft tannins, good finish too. "
8145,1175940,Not a lot of nose but rich in the mouth full of red fruits and good amount of tannines. Watch out for the sediment.
8146,1246181,Smooth touriga cabernet. Can be aged some more years.
8147,1246181,"Another great wine from Douro Valley, produced by Real Companhia Velha showing all the powerfulness and character of its terroir. The very dark Rubi colour creates the first impact...in the nose its worth to notice the aromas of the black fruit compote well conjugated with the wood. In the mouth a perfect balance between a deep and full bodied with very light tannins and low alcoholic perception, prevailing a long-end finish with increased acidity. An expressive wine that shows all its involvement."
8148,1246181,"The Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional blend. Aged 18 months in new oak barrels. Elegant, complex, full-bodied wine with black berries, vanilla, tobacco and bark of deciduous trees aromas. Very interesting."
8149,1246181,Aromatic Fruits and already some sustained tannins
8150,1246181,"As right away you can feel the cabernet on its nose. Although it has one 20% and the rest a delicious red fruits, dark coloured touriga nacional. Fresh and peppery it is only a regional duriense wine. In taste you feel some soft tannins and a bitter sweet raspberry flavour. "
8151,1246181,"Full bodied, smooth with a hint of vanilla and aroma of tobacco. Short after taste"
8152,1246181,"Good Douro proposition,rounded and very polite presentation!Nice deep garnet in color and a nose of sweet spices,deep ripe dark fruit,vanilla and dark chocolate.The mouth is balanced,firm but delicate tannins and mild acidity!The palate is not far from the nose,with a medium length end.The 2007 was for me slightly better!"
8153,1246181,"(3.5) Blend of CS and Touringa National. Nose is aromatic and promising richness with aromas of blackurrant, plums and bit spicy and oaky.  At the mouth attack is freshly fruity and seedy, full bodied, tart with noticeable adicity, but midpalate and finish is rather flat with subdued flavors of plums, red berries and bit woody.  Might looking like elegant, but actually depth is lacking."
8154,1246181,"3.7* At the begining nose is quite rich but with domination of mix strawberries and ruspberries ... than after 3 hours comes still into straw and ruspberries but with almond nad vanilla aromas. In taste well build but with dry middle tanins, some ruspberries, nugat and spicies like pepper."
8155,1246181,"Pleasant taste, Black fruit, nice balanced. "
8156,1246181,"Pomegranate. Spicy one, with nuts, prunes, pomegranate and blackberry, taste cannot remember :)"
8157,1246181,It was an interesting wine from Duoro since I opened the red fruit aromas flow from the bottle when serving in the decanter. After 20 min in the decanter the flavor improved. The acidity was well balanced with fine tannins and medium persistence in mouth. I couldn’t see the colors because was dark however I will try again 
8158,1246181,"And this time next blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Touriga Nacional from Douro region. Nice compilation of these two grapes showing power of CS fruity style and TN vanilla, leather and earthy style.   🍇 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Touriga Nacional   👁 violet in the glass   👃 blackberry strawberry cherry raspberry pepper tobacco oak vanilla chocolate - all of these aromas available in this blend  👅 full bodied with high acidity. Tannin wine with perfect fruity and oaky finish.  Tasted during wine fest! "
8159,1246181,"Not that typical blend. Cabernet Sauvignon with Touriga National. Syrah with TN I tasted but CS with TN? Still quite dark purple colour with garnet hues with aromas of blackberry, blackcurrant cherry with fine nuances of chocolate, vanilla, tobacco and some flowery touch. Only medium-bodied on the palate, medium acidity and rather smooth mellow tannins. Rich fruity flavours of black fruit, red fruit well complemented by oak spices as vanilla, tobacco, a whiff of pepper. Persistent fruity-spicy aftertaste."
8160,1246181,"Surprising blend of touriga Nacional and cabernet sauvignon, cherries, full mouth, smooth"
8161,1271699,Granate colour with purple borders. Fluid and clear. Smell to berries and wood. Acid taste.
8162,1271699,"Bright red color with purple reflections. Distinct aromas of cherries and red berry fruits and restrained flavors of chocolate and oak. On the palate develop strong flavored fruit notes, the acid is optimally integrated. Good everyday wine."
8163,1271699,"Notes from a Portuguese tasting a while back: nice appealing, perfumed floral, earthy spicy nose. On the palate first of all a really nice concentration and balance here. Lots of juicy ripe plummy and red fruit, deep and pure, spicy sweet with leather, chocolate and rounded tannins. 4++"
8164,1271699,Easy. Depth of flavor. 
8165,1271699,Nice rich taste. Good finish.
8166,1271699,"Not a fan.  Dark fiery red colour.  The nose is full of heat, olive tapenade.  A bit salty.  The palate is bitter.  Full bodied but not pleasant.  Rated 2.2.  At $25 not for me."
8167,1271699,Mein Weinkeller: Portugal is coming!u
8168,1271699,Excellent value:price.  90.       28/09/2013
8169,1271699,"Bingo. Complex, red berry nose & flavours. Succulent finish. Laid down for 9 years."
8170,1271699,Tannins and dark plums round out this very young approachable wine.
8171,1271699,"I really liked this one, especially for the price. I'm just now beginning to discover Portuguese wines, and I'm becoming a big fan. This one had a wonderful nose, full body, ample structure, and most importantly, character. It's not too often that can be said for a wine that costs only $15. Perhaps it was that 2011 was an excellent year for Douro. I also realize this isn't the most complex Douro out there, so I'm looking forward to trying the others that I've been picking up."
8172,1271699,I really can’t believe how good this was. It had not only lasted but had improved immeasurably. The later vintages are good but the 2008 was superb. I think that was my last bottle unfortunately. 
8173,1271699,"Good body good shape good taste that slink away in a trapdoor after an hour or so, great price to pair with literally anything one desire. Had two bottles within a month, consistent quality."
8174,1271699,Excellent for the price!!! Very palatable... European nose with dark fruit- cedar wood and slate.  Pleasant lingering aftertaste-
8175,1271699,"Appearance-clear, medium in intensity, ruby, distinctive legs.  Nose-clean, medium+ in aromatic intensity, aromas of plum, blackberry, chocolate, vanilla, kirsch, black cherry, developing. Palate-dry, medium acidity, medium+ tannins, high alcohol, medium+ body, medium+ flavour intensity, flavours of red and black berries, kirsch, pepper, plum, powerful, complex, elegant, medium+ finish. A good wine. Can drink now, but has potential for ageing."
8176,1741942,"Another great example of top quality red wine from the Douro. Just the right amount of fruit. Red currants, figs, cigar box, cinnamon bark and licorice. Med tannins and med+ acidity that gives a good mouthfeel. It has great depth and a really nice red fruity finish. "
8177,1741942,Duas Quintas  was one of our favorite Portuguese wines the special reserve was an even better experience. Red fruits  chocolate and spices mixed to form.a bold characteristic taste along with a nice bouquet. It is well balanced and very smooth to drink . Highly  recommended 
8178,1741942,"A souvenir of Portugal 🇵🇹 I bought at Lisbon Airport.  Douro red of Duas Quintas, currently under the umbrella of Roederer and made from field blend (I presume Touriga Nacional & Franca are predominant with some others like Tinta Barroca) with 80 yo vines. Foot trodden & fermented in traditional vats.  The wine is 11 years old but still very young as the color shows deep ruby and the nose is developing: pronounced black fruits like black berries, black cherry, perfumed violet, ->"
8179,1741942,"What a wine: rich, fruity, perfectly integrated with the wood, long. A perfect Douro wine"
8180,1741942,92 pts me The top of the line red wine with 60 euro price.  A field blend from a single vineyard with some prephylloxera old vine and made with foot stumping like port   Rather tight on the nose and mineral driven with charcoal cinnamon and dark fruit mulberries on a bit of soft cheese  A rich tannin yet silky smooth and soft with ripeness​ Alcoholic finish   Quite very extracted and powerful
8181,1741942,A bit too young to give everything. Complex but shy on the nose and still on a strong tannic structure. The mouth is velvety and very promising.
8182,1741942,"Rich elegant aromas, amazing wine. Like in the label, really special. Wow..."
8183,1741942,It was absolutely perfect very well balanced ready to drink 
8184,1741942,"Already the Roman Empire brought wine in a professional manner in the Douro region. Hundreds of years experience, a incredible terroir and a extraordinary climate with plenty of sun and heat but view grapes made this wine...  * the color a intensive purple  * the bouquet dominated by ripe prune, roasted aromas, mocha, tobacco, dark chocolate and spices accomplishing it * on the palate dense fruit, special tannins and mind blowing power.  A special Portuguese red for the special moment of TN number 999"
8185,1741942,"Decanted before drinking but not terribly long. Nose was fairly restrained to start with, started to come in with herbs and dark fruits. A little coffee and chocolate. Very good Douro, and with a bit of age on it. "
8186,1741942,"Very interesting wine, oak, vanilla, herbs"
8187,1741942,Powerfull and spicy .
8188,1741942,"Time needed, deep with a soullllll"
8189,1741942,Good..tried at fish place in lisbon
8190,1741942,"Nice typical Douro taste, 2009 have still been a good year for for Duas Quintas. Little acid taste but not to significant. "
8191,83737,"Big fan if Churchill's and this is where my love of port started. Gorgeous port, full of fruit but the dryness keeps it clean and balanced."
8192,83737,"Rusty purple, little more opaque.   Raisins dominate the nose.   A nice balance of sweet and tart. A slight metallic iron and caramel finish. "
8193,83737,"Medium garnet, pronounced intensity, cooked fruits, red and black cherries, blakckberry, chocolate on the palate, accompanied by spices, well integrated alcohol, acidity and sweetness."
8194,83737,"Pretty good deal for a good LBV, full of deep cherry and raisin flavors.  Tertiary aromas starting to show and add to a wonderful complexity."
8195,83737,"I don't really have any experience with port, so I can't write an authoritative review. The quality is good as far as I can tell. Sweet prunes, maraschino cherry and toasty oak notes. Fun to try, but not in my wheelhouse."
8196,83737,"Enjoyed tasting this port with Churchill’s winemaker Ricardo Nunes.  Certainly the best LBV I’ve ever tasted.  Didn’t realise that LBV aged for this long but this still has legs.  Benefits from being made in a non-vintage year meaning that it gets the better grapes.  Matured in oak vats for four years before being bottled.  2005 was a hot vintage but this is still elegant and fresh.  Herbal notes with spice, black cherry and liquorice on the palate.  Firm tannic backbone.  Drier finish than many ports."
8197,83737,"Mild, a light nutty taste, consistent flavor all the way through the aftertaste. Smooth but the flavor is a little milder/watered down compared to similar price range."
8198,83737,Well despite the worst cork ever I managed to salvage the bottle.  Very smooth and delicious.  Ruby red.
8199,83737,Raisins and chocolate
8200,83737,Nicely aged golden colored port.  Honey start but dry finish.  High VOC. 19.5%
8201,83737,"Cherry and oak, well integrated "
8202,83737,Very nice.  Heavy fruit like you would expect.  Smooth. 
8203,83737,Such good wine at such a good price? I don't understand.
8204,83737,"Cherry, lively acidity, prune raisin dark chocolate "
8205,83737,Nice port with an elegant taste of Black fruits 
8206,1275912,"4,0. This is at the end of its peak life and I am glad we had it today as it was very nice. Very much chocolate nose .com NF from a brownish purple rim. Very deep nose actually. On the palate black candies cherries, again mixed with dark chocolate. Medium to light weight with left over acidity to show this was well made. "
8207,1275912,"Another Lisboa region wine, now a blend of 80% Touriga Nacional + 15% Syrah + Petit Verdot aged for 18 months in French oak barrels (30% new). Grenade red color. Nice aromas of very ripe red fruits with notes of wood, licorice, vanilla and toasted coffee. Medium-bodied (13.5%), well-balanced Portuguese wine with nice acidity and alcohol, properly matching rich, velvety, elegant tannins. Finish is robust, smooth and persistent. An 88-GB pts beautiful wine at its evolutionary peak. Don't wait anymore!!"
8208,1275912,A violet brown Portuguese Ribatejo with plums and coffee in the nose. Slightly lean body but warm.  
8209,1275912,Dark Ruben red. Blackberry and blueberry in the nose. Elegant palette with blackberry and noticeable tannins as well as a long finish.
8210,1275912,"4.3 big complexity: strong taste empowered by the age. Strong Note of leather oak tobacco but also some refreshing note like mint or violet. Probably at is peak, better to enjoy it before 15 years not later"
8211,1275912,"4.3 truly amazing and exceptional value for money. Certainly at its peak. Soft tannins, elegant and silky notes. "
8212,1275912,"Lekkûh! Vanilla and cherries. Nose and mouth in harmony. Good length. Not very complex, but good for its money. "
8213,1275912,"For a Lisbon region red wine, I'm pretty surprised!"
8214,1275912,"Juicy red, supple tannins and a great acidity to back it up!"
8215,1275912,"Solid, good flavour but not outstanding."
8216,1275912,Amazing nose and durable taste. very balanced.
8217,1275912,"Srong and oaky wine. Brownish in color, ages distinctively."
8218,1275912,"14 years in bottle and still complex and enjoyable! Spices but little fruit in the aromas, touch of dried leaves and jammed fruit, clove and nice acidity, complexe but à bit over the hill... Should have drunk it 2  years ago, I think... But for the current price it was a nice experience!"
8219,1275912,"A nice wine. Medium bodied, violet, blueberries, black pepper, toast. High acidity. Very nice indeed"
8220,1275912,"Very good wine. Slightly acid at first, requires breathing!"
8221,20542,"Good Portuguese wine! Medium-low tannin with remarkable flavors of oak. Nice balance, I recommend! "
8222,20542,Dark berries good balance
8223,20542,"Nice, good structure and tannins "
8224,20542,"Garnet red color, fruits, figs. Dried raisin..."
8225,20542,"The fact of being a 2007 makes it smooth and soft, great finish and strong body."
8226,20542,"Fruity and rich, full body."
8227,20542,"Tasted in Dec 2009. Deep ruby colour and complex aroma, where the ripe and hot fruit is involved by spices notes, acquired awhen the long maturation in oak barrels. Very long final."
8228,20542,Another good Douro
8229,20542,"Aroma, down to earth, ground like with licorice. Medium acid and tannines. Not so strong aroma or long lasting. Giving air for the wine helps."
8230,20542,"Impressive for portugal. A bit simple taste, none the less good for every day for light meats and cheeses."
8231,20542,"This might be one of my basic desert islands wines - it's interesting, but not overpowering - fairly fresh in the mouth, but not a lightweight by any means - very nice."
8232,20542,Fruity and lush. very nice drinking wine. full bodied and herbal. 
8233,20542,"A very good bottle. Lush berries, light tannins, some wood and beautiful acidity "
8234,20542,smooth round fruity
8235,1598254,"Fresh and rich nose - smells like it has some maturity, though hard to describe what I mean. The palate is rich and acidic, with strawberry (ripe, possibly even cooked) and oak. Really nice rose which tastes like a really quality white."
8236,1598254,"89/100 It is Touriga Nacional aged in oak for six months. Complex and developed nose. It smells like an aged white wine. Notes of natural gas, strawberry, and pepper. This has light fruit flavors and high acidity. It’s highly structured for a rosé, long finish. Light amount of tannins."
8237,1598254,"#outubrorosanovivino #umbrindeàprevencão For this prevention campaign against breast cancer, I chose this amazing portuguese rosé made from Touriga Nacional grapes. Limpid salmon color with cupper glances. Nose of red fruits as cherries and strawberries with smoked and floral notes. In mouth, fresh, refreshing with  vivid structure. Ellegant red fruit flavors wrapped in floral and mineral structure, good body and acidity with challenging tannins and remarkable red fruit lingering aftertaste. Cheers!"
8238,1598254,One of the best roses I've ever tasted Very dry and needs food
8239,1598254,"Salmon color ... red fruit ... minerals ... oak ... res.sugar 0,6 g/l ... grapes of Touriga Nacional ... heavier type of Rose wine ... i like it"
8240,1598254,"Dry, bitter, paired greatly with cheese and aged smoky, cured meats. Earthy tannins with root-based flavors and hints of pears."
8241,1598254," Salmon color. Very fragrant wine, floral aroma, with light smoky notes.  In the mouth it is textured, dry and intense, with iodinated notes  Very long finish. A wine that stands out and surprises who proves it."
8242,1598254,"Salmon color proves to be elegant and outstanding in texture, with delicate fruit and minerality. On the nose it is perfumed, flowery with light smoky notes, white chocolate and white cherry. The test is full of texture and finesse, dry, mineral, juicy and long."
8243,1598254,A classic good rose but nothing special about it 
8244,1598254,"Superb Alentejo rose....great fruity & fresh taste, well balanced & easy going. Really good....cheers! 🥂"
8245,1598254,"Chemical on the nose in a good way Light, good balance Touriga nacional At winery"
8246,1598254,"I was surprised to find a rose this great from Portugal. This wine is up there with best rose wines from Bandol. Great body, dry and makes an excellent companion to sea food. "
8247,1598254,"Super fatty fruity rosé,  the one I was looking for this summer."
8248,1598254,Oaky nose. Smooth finish and dry for a Rose 
8249,1598254,Definitely one of the best Rose I ever had.
8250,74701,"Ripe blackberry, palate is mild"
8251,74701,"Color: dark red with a black center Nose: thyme, red fruit On the palate: black currant, cherries, spices. Quite interesting red wine."
8252,74701,"Confusing as their website indicates that their AB monocasta would be 100% AB yet the back label seems to say this was made ""mainly"" from AB. Still, it's a decent, drinkable product. Has more personality on the nose (taco shell and squid ink, anyone?) than on the palate where I find a freshness that is a bit too cleansing and a tannin that is on the young side (a 2014 drinking in 2016; 12 months in small oak barrels; ageing potential according to the label of up to 7 years). 14.5% abv."
8253,74701,"Ripe dark berries with herbs,  coffee and liquorice. But a little acidic"
8254,74701,"Smooth, velvet, Black fruit"
8255,74701,"Tremendous value for money. Full bodies, fruity"
8256,74701,Nice wine! Flavors of blackberries and vanille. Good combination with cheese plate.
8257,74701,"Brimming red from Portugal. Bursting with ripe black currant and brambles. Still very accessible, soft tannins and acidity. Very deep. 8,95 at Henri Bloem."
8258,74701,"Warm ripe berries, jam, vanilla, earthy notes. Round smooth body and impressive finish with pleasant acidity and tannins. Dense and drinkable wine. One of the best Alicante for this price. "
8259,74701,"What a kick-ass wine! Blind tasted I thought Jumilla Monastrell or a Zinfandel due to the power, bursting red fruit, bramble, American oak, chocolate, sweet tobacco. Supposed to be slightly rough wine but this is super polished. Great stuff! Insane value. I think the extra age in bottle helped as tannins are almost high but very ripe and velvety. "
8260,74701,"My type of red wine. Full bodied, dark, smooth and delicious. Nose of black fruits, black pepper, hints of leather. Palate filled with ripe flavors of black cherries, stewed blackberries, blueberries, finished by well integrated acidity and tannins. It went down easy and was a great value for €7.50."
8261,74701,"4.0. I wasn’t sure what to expect here, but wow! This was surprisingly good! Very fruit forward with lots of extraction. A big wine. Blackberry, black plum, eucalyptus, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and dried garden herbs. Somewhat akin to a Napa CS or Aussie Shiraz. M+ tannins are ripe and smooth, but there is clear structure and power here."
8262,74701,Very interesting wine. Rich and beautiful taste. Very full-bodied.
8263,74701,"4.0 nice wine. Rasins, red fruit vanilla blackcurrant plum oak . Not sonintense and deep but good. 12 euro in auchan."
8264,74701,Dark berry and heavier bodied wine with smooth earthy vanilla notes. There's a bit of spiciness. Unique. Very enjoyable. I would buy it again.

8266,1182531,"Dark fruit, dry and a little stony "
8267,1182531,"A dark Red. With lactic notes. Very dense and complex wine, still fresh. "
8268,1182531,"Not 4, more like 4.5 :). Delicious chocolate overtones, and everything else :)"
8269,1182531,Always a pleasure  drink this wine. So intense and so taste!
8270,1182531,"Intense ruby red color with thin garnet rim. The nose displays ripe black fruit aromas, chickpeas, sesame seeds,  green olives, hummus, sweet spices, rockrose, dry grass and tree bark, a very complex and attractive set. Very serious and austere character, full-bodied, balanced, smooth tannins and pleasant acidity. The palate is very fresh, textured, graceful, stylish, slightly concentrated, with long finish."
8271,1182531,"Good red from Alentejo! Made with Aragonês, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet, a typical regional blend, from higher altitude vines in the mountain range of S. Mamede. Bold, complex and well balanced, with good acidity and length. Ruby color, with brownish hues, ripe red fruits/berries aroma/flavors, with notes of spices, vanilla and an hint of oak toast. Full body, polished tannins and a nice lingering finish. Very nice!  (VV price tag is incorrect)"
8272,1182531,"Perfect combination with stuffed port cheek Light , rounded with structure"
8273,1182531,"Plenty of tertiaries , not a lot of tannins,"
8274,1182531,"Medium ruby with intense aromas of red fruits and slightly floral with notes of chocolate. Dry, big tannins with a well balanced acidity, big and voluptuous on the mouth with strawberries and cherries. A good wine slightly overpriced."
8275,1182531,"Smooth, bold and mild dry fruits. Delicious!"
8276,1182531,Fruity though very heavy on wood - I love this kind of wine. Round tannins. Super!

8281,1293594,"Over 100 years old vine, pulling a dense and powerful wine, acidity and spicy with style - a field blend from more than 35 grape varieties, produced only in great vintages - awesome wine"
8282,1293594,"Why talk about what I smell: raspberries, strawberry, mushrooms, leather, green pepper etc etc. What I smell, you don't smell. The smell that I smell today will change over the next months or years. I prefer to focusing on the history of the producer, understand the place where it's made, and how it was done. Appreciating the wine with the right food pairing and the enjoying the special moments the wine is creating is what truly connects people.     "
8283,1293594,"What a wine! Incredible balanced and elegant peace. Complex, with layers of flavours. Wow!"
8284,1293594,So nice red wine 
8285,1293594,A jóia do douro.
8286,1293594,Gorgeous wine. Dark berries up front. Leather mid palate and a huge long licorice finish. Bold but well integrated tannins that soften with a little air. One of the nicest wines I’ve had in. Very long time. 
8287,1293594,"Fantastic wine. Lots of dark fruit, great complexity. Full-bodied and probably close to the height of its drinking window. I assume it will drink extremely well for at least another 5 years."
8288,1293594,Can't go wrong with this one.
8289,1293594,"Very nice red however didn’t reach the blowout level I remember or the fame it holds. Maybe it’s the bottle or storage conditions I don’t know, but anyway slightly disappointing. Apart from that tasted really good. "
8290,1293594,"For me this wine is the best Douro ! Fine intensity at nose, dark red fruit, blueberry, spice, chocolate, oak and leather. Power and finesse at mouth, complex structure refined tannic, Perfect!  "
8291,1293594,"Absolutely spectacular.  Needs a little time to open up, but when it does one of the best wines I've tasted.  Deep and complex, could be mistaken for a top super Tuscan.  Not cheap but well worth it. Check out the website's description of this wine - great story.  "
8292,1293594,"Awesome!, plummy, rich, intense, figs on the nose. Lots to like except probably the price, an exceptional wine  from a top producer"
8293,1293594,Vibrant burst of fruits and acidity. Aged well but I would give it 6 more years.
8294,1293594,Ufff... Top 1% in the world... Without a doubt.

8297,75987,"Fresh raisins , ruby color not like lbv. Sweet, full flavored. Quite simple for lbv but good. Alcohol quite clear, dries mouth a bit. Ok but nothing special"
8298,75987,"Lindo Porto, color negro brillante con destellos violáceos. Aromas a higos en compota, frutos secos, caramelo y chocolate. En boca se siente grueso, pesado, algo arenoso, apenas especiado y con buen final.                                                   Cute Porto, bright black with violet flashes. Aromas of figs in compote, nuts, caramel and chocolate. In the mouth it feels thick, heavy, something sandy, barely spiced and with a good finish."
8299,75987,"Great Port!  4 years in oak, late bottled. Wonderful ruby purple, opaque red Port with a sweet perfume of red fruits, herbs, vanilla, tobacco and roses. Very harmonic mouth, fruity almost jammy, good oak, herb and minerals with a hint of peppers and spices. Long finish. --- Rubi púrpura, vermelho opaco, maravilhoso Porto com um perfume adocicado de frutas vermelhas, ervas, baunilha, tabaco e rosas.

8304,75987,"Excellent port, sweet, but still dry character "
8305,75987,Very very good LBV. Maybe a bit disappointing rating to that of Graham's.  Not tanin and a much bigger wine.

8307,75987,"very soft taste, amazing wine for its price. the closest to an intermediate vintage. it doesnt say it all just by the smell, you need to drink to uncover it."

8330,6156968,"Deep ruby red colored wine made of the varieties of Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet. Ripe and smooth revealing the warmth of the Alentejo region. It has broad juice blackberry fruit, brambles and a leathery sensation. Soft and full- bodied wine with rich tannins and fine final acidity ."

8338,1182485,"What a wine. Deep ruby, vanilla and oak in the nose and the full body. By far the best portuguese wine I have tasted and that include Douro. If Ronaldo was a wine this would be it.  "

Nose: intense spices, black pepper, licorice, anise, ripe red sweet fruits, dried herbs, leather and mineral accents.

8343,1182485,‘Wet. Red grapes. Includes alcohol’ - WP description. But really ‘dry’.   Enjoyed from wine store in Lisbon with WP at airbnb. 
8344,1182485,"A beautiful wine that I think only becomes more beautiful over the years...  Tanne rich, blackcurrant, plum and vanilla... Potential to become a topper."
8345,1182485,"Extremely pleasant and light, right amount of flavor. I came back one hour later (90min after opening) to increase the rating. Opened up marvelously. Drank with very spicy Thai food, must repeat"

8349,1182485,"Medium body, deep complex taste of dark berries. Nice on palate. "
8350,1182485,"Tasted blind. Kind of Rioja style, not easy to guess country and grape. (100% Syrah). Ok wine, but miss softness on the tannins."
8351,1182485,100 percent syrah grapes
8352,1182485,"Jammy cherry, red fruit, green bell pepper. Slight wood on the palate. Great choice from Alentejo"
8353,8039,"Always a pleasure coming back to this amazing red from Alentejo!  This is a rich Syrah, aged 8m in French oak barrels. Bold, deep and complex, with  a firm yet elegant tannic structure, excellent acidity and great length. Purple color, floral, dark fruits aroma/flavors, with notes of cassis, spices, mint, toast, an hint of mocha and well integrated oak. Full bodied, ripe polished tannins and a tasty lingering finish. Splendid wine, drinking well now but still growing!"
8354,8039,"Enthusiastic blend of wild berry red fruits, wooden toast, meat and tar notes. The palate is complex, with a strong palate of ripe wild fruit and a captivating balance. Smooth at first, showing firm throughout the race, excellent structure of tannins and a pleasant freshness, with good acidity to contribute to a long and persistent finish."
8355,8039,"Enjoyed this fabulously stunning Shiraz on its own in order not to miss or ""pollute"" any single note. Simply staggering. I think it could pick up with Hermitage wines. Still very dark garnet purble colour. Very rich complex aromas with layers of plum, blueberry, blackberry wonderfully intertwined with very distinctive spices as pepper, vanilla, licorice, smoke, vanilla, leather, tobacco. Full-bodied with medium acidity, very firm mighty tannins. Flavours of black fruit, raspberry, licorice. Endlessly 😋😋🏁"
8356,8039,"Meeting to taste Vinhos Imperfeitos (meaning Imperfect Wines). Casa Santo Antônio, February 9.  After the imperfects we move on to great reds.  Incognito vertical: 2008, 9, 12 and 14.  All very expressive, fruit compote, vanilla, chocolate.  Rate 4.3"

8365,8039,In love with this wine. Perfect balance of flavor and body. Model syrah.
8366,8039,"Called Incógnito from the time it was launched and the Syrah grape was less accepted than it is now in Alentejo, the wine is dark, dense and concentrated. It is shot through with blackberry and plum flavors that are layered with dense tannins and a perfumed aftertaste. "
8367,8039,"Another 100% Syrah grape type from Portugal. I think this was probably their high end range as the oak profile was a league above the rest of the wines being served, very elegant oak from the nose. Content was decent, very easygoing and friendly drink. However at €60 a bottle I'd refrain from recommending my audience as the price is probably not worth it. "
8368,4075391,"Green apples, lemon, pineapple, butter, a bit creamy. High acidity. "
8369,4075391,Tropical fruits and some buttery notes on the palate. Felt a little flabby and overly fruit-laden. Nine months on French oak being too much. Decent enough but not one that’s going to get a repeat purchase.
8370,4075391,"I'm not sure if the 'c' is hard or soft, good wine though"
8371,4075391,Tropical fruits with butter from the oak. Persistent flavor. 
8372,4075391,Not fantastic. Needs more maturit. A blend would be betyer suited.
8373,4075391,"Buttery clear floral volatiles, fades quickly to bitter in the mouth. Lightly sweet. Tropical pineapple"
8374,5515829,"Deep crimson, opulent, fresh nose, red fruit, dry, dusty but well integrated tannins, and long-ish finish. This is a powerful wine and I like it!"
8375,5515829,"excellent wine from Lisboa, 🇵🇹 from a winery founded in 1495.   🍇 Touriga Nacional, Alicante Bouschet and Petit Verdot  Fermentation of TN in oak barrels, AB and PV ferment in stainless steel.

8376,5515829,Uptick from last time! Real nice! Aging amazing!!! 
8377,5515829,"Not my kinda wine. Too oaky, extracted. Well made tough. Still pretty young and has some considerable concentration and intensity to evolve during some 10,15 years. 4.1"
8378,5515829," Purple colour, bright and deep intensity.  Clean nose and medium (+) aromatic intensity  with black (prevailing) and red fruits in compote, blackberries, plums, blueberries, cherries, figs, raspberries, violets, mint, vanilla, caramel, licorice, cocoa, black pepper, cloves, sweet tobacco and toasted.

8386,5515829,"Ótimo corte da Quinta de Pancas, ainda jovem e que deve melhorar com mais um par de anos na adega. Bela acidez, taninos secantes, corpo M+, especiarias, notas de carvalho tostado, final longo e agradável.  Great blend from Quinta de pancas, still young and that should improve over a couple of years in cellar. Beautiful acidity, drying tannins, M+ bodied, spices, notes of toasted oak, long and pleasant finish."

8398,5394278,Purchased at local market store in Lisbon and it was a very delicious rose and perfect chill on the patio wine.  
8399,5394278,"Light. Easy to drink. Very little to say outside this. It is rather average, more like any average table wine."
8400,5394278,Good wine. Simple. Damascus and orange.  
8401,5394278,"Light in alcohol and a little light in flavour, however perfect for an alfresco lunch in Lisbon "

Raisins and dried currants, lots of spices, some sandalwood. Soft and velvety on the palate, medium sweet. Balanced and rich. De-li-ci-ous. 18 pts @ Ton Overmars tasting"
8430,80426,96pts me Consistent with my previous score of this particular bottle.   A south facing vineyard at the Douro River with a chapel dedicated to the saint mary   Massive big wine initially tight on a nose open with incredible amount of mulberry cassis and sweet cream of cherry. You can smell the French oak yet the wine is so powerful. There's also that hint of grappa green making it balanced and grounded  This bottle will age another 20 + year silky smooth tannin already yet you can chew on the wine 
8431,80426,"4,5 Excellent  Added to my favorites "
8432,80426,Powerful Vintage! Good things appear in small portions and this bottle follows that rule. Another WOW coming from DOW which is something normal for their patterns.
8433,80426,"(4,4) I don’t have any problem with young Vintage Port. There’s an exuberant fruitiness and richness to it, that is highly impressive. This is on the verge of steerin away from the young phase, but still has much of its big fruitiness. Lush, rich smell of liqueur, lavender, roses, plums, cassis and black cherries. Rich flavours. Like biting into amarena cherries with their rich flavours. Black amarena cherries, raisins, glue, violets, licorice, lavender and chocolate."
8434,1179680,Nose is quite animalistic. Not very nice. Taste is excellent. Light sourness and still primary fruit with some bite. Delicious 93 points

8438,1179680,"Delicious vintage port from Sandeman. Dark red color, ripe berries on the palate, lots of power and sweetness. An excellent dessert wine. "
8439,1179680,"This is a lovely way to end an evening as it grows a little chilly out on the terrace.  This came recommended as a great tipple after our Cherry Pie Pinot and it truly is.  It has many of the same characteristics but with the bold and thick sweetness of fortified wines.  The bold fruit is enveloped in creamy caramel richness and a slight hint of spice in a long, lingering finish.  It warms the soul and everything else too."
8440,1179680,"Bold and deep, full of raisins and dried berries. Very well-balanced, with long spicy and fresh aftertaste. Absolutely loved this small bottle of Porto!"
8441,1179680,Have to go four on this one!  Dense with intensity of a young ruby port together with the character and spice of an older tawny ...drank at Quinta do sexio

8445,1179680,The bottle says it was supposed to last 12 years max and yet I drank it 18 years later and I found it to be more than very good really enjoyed it
8446,1179680,"An glass of Vintage Port ‘on the house’ to finish a lovely dinner at restaurant Rossio in Lisbon.  Elegance, fruit, light sweetness from the berries ending in sophisticated dry roundness. Cheers 🍷"
8447,1179680,"This was actually a 1999 Vintage that was bottled in 2001.  It was a half bottle that I got for 20 bucks.  The cork crumbled, and I had a hard time getting out all the little bits.  But the wine was excellent.  It's smooth and rich, sweet and spicy."
8448,1179680,"Very good vintage from this famous brand,  that together with Ferreira and Offley is still owned by a Portoguese company.  This vintage has intense, very ripe red fruit (mainly strawberry) aromas on the nose and rich plummy flavours on the palate.  Tannins are nicely soft (it's going to be old enough by now) and the finish is long for this very good Port.   Classical pairing with chocolate and chocolate-based desserts."
8449,7104415,Love that. Really surprise by this unusual Portugal wine. Light body. Kinda dark Pinot noir in the style. Great one
8450,7104415,"A Castelão single varietal. Juicy plum, rose petals, and chocolate. Medium bodied with noticeable oak. Not complex but tasty and very enjoyable. "
8451,7104415,"Ruby red. Blackberry, plums and dark chocolate. Medium to full body. Concentrated fruit with well balanced tannins. Nice complexity and good finish"
8452,7104415,"[Portugal Collection Tasting] Beautiful demonstration of the potential of Castelão. Earthy and perfumed nose with raspberry, black currant and oak followed by a smooth, velvety palate with nice acidity/tannines balance, vanilla, red & black fruit and long finish. 4.0"
8453,7104415,"A very good wine for the price. Kinda Portugese Lange Nebbiolo :) Fruity and dry Elegant and tasty Nose is amazing , floral and spicy. Palate is full of red fruit, pepper , earthy, minerals. Oak is only in the background. Not too complex just a classy and very tasty wine. And still very young "
8454,7104415,"A juicy Castelao aged 17m in french oak shows red cherries, orange peel, plums and dried rose petals with a nice long mineral finish. For fans of Burgundy and Nebbiolo."
8455,7104415,"Made with the Castelao grape which is not fruit generous. Very savory, earthy with herb elements. Still tannin so needs 2-5 years. Much fruitier with food.  Red berry and white pepper.  88 pts"
8456,7104415,"Light ruby color. Ref fruits, plum, cherry, chocolate. Earthy notes. Bold and tannic."
8457,7104415,Thought it was a gamay in blind tasting. Surprising Douro wine

8459,7104415,Dark sweet fruit. Chocolate on the nose. I think I am in love
8460,7104415,Red currant baking spice medium tanins delicious 
8461,7104415,Big and lacking balance
8462,7104415,Very good! Perfect for food.
8463,7104415,"Liked it. Light weight, not your Portuguese powerful some times fruit bomb. This varietal is quite interesting, can resemble a Pinot or any other easy going grape. Quite complexed."
8464,3835964,"Deliciously rich, deep red in color, spicy, smoked, perfumed, fruity, sweet tannins, balanced, fantastic! Old vines, 60 years+,  aged for 14 months in new French oak barrels, 13,5% abv. Face to face Riedel decanter, amazing dinner."
8465,3835964,"Almost brick colour, it has still a dark tone. Smells of wild berries and a bit oxidated as leather and sweat begin to appear. It is similar in taste, with the tannins softning, and a medium finish."
8466,3835964,"Very nice. Ideal balance. Some oak, some leather, some musk. Ideal. But price..."
8467,3835964,"A slowly aged Douro with 13.5% abv. originating from 60 yo. grapes and aged in new French oak for 14 months.  Overripe raspberry and blood orange paired with kirsch and raisins. Licorice and chocolate underneath, as well as ash, oak, leather and tertiary balsamic scents.  The palate extends the nose by roasted meat, rosemary and earthy flavours. Fresh, balanced, complex.  Med body with quite high tannins, well matching med+ acidity. Too much pepper and alcohol on the long balsamic finish, thus ""only"" 4🌟."

8469,4778668,"A blend of organically grown: 40% Antao Vaz, 20% Perrum, 20% Rabo de Ovelha, and 20% Manteudo grapes. Vinified in amphora without temperature control. Indigenous yeasts were used during fermentation.The wine was bottle-aged for two months. Deep gold and clear. Dry, high acidity and med+ body. Apple, citrus, peach, flint and butter. Short finish. Not well balanced but still pleasing."
8470,4778668,"89/100 Blend of Antão Vaz, Prum, Rabo de Ovelha, and Manteúdo on the skins for six months. This is a clean orange wine. Again it is clean and well done, with a touch of yeastiness and oxidation. Notes of lemon, fresh apricot, dried peaches, and dried flowers. It’s more of a fresh orange wine, there is bite here and a low level of tannins. Very easy to drink"
8471,4778668,"Fruity, light bitter, feels a bit like a orange wine. "
8472,4778668,The best orange wine I had do far
8473,4778668,"Fruity, dry with some minerals, yrast notes and pears."
8474,4778668,Too much grass and a bit too sweet for my taste

First skin contact white from Portugal done in amphora,indigenous yeast, 12%. Super enjoyable! 4.2 "
8480,4778668,"🌟4,0 It was the overall favourite of the Orange wines tasting (not my personal), I guess, cause this was the least orangy of all. Producer says, indigenous yeast was used and wine was aged with must for 45 days in amphora- honestly, I have a share of doubt, as I’ve tasted numerous amphora orange wines. This one seemed very polished and conventional winemaking wise. In no way it was a worse wine, just different,more traditional. Well done 👃🏻Lush and fruity with tropical fruit, coconut and wet wool 🛒🇪🇪MilVinhos"
8481,4778668,Dry white - to me tasted slightly acidic (may have gotten a bad bottle); only got it because of the interesting production method - not my taste and among the low performers from Alentejo
8482,4778668,"Well done, feels authentic in some odd way.  apple peach honey"
8483,4778668, apple peach nice to scampi pasta.

8487,1166848,"Make no mistake this is not a shy Rosé, only just misses a 4*. Redoma is always good, from a top grower and this doesn’t disappoint. "
8488,1166848,"Strawberry, vanilla, finishes creamy with some oak.   Ok for being a rose. Worked well with a summery salmon & noodles dish. "
8489,1166848,"Lovely rose colour, some bitterness - maybe from skin contact; hint of an oxidated feel as well, fresh on a warm May evening on (almost) the arctic circle"
8490,1166848,Fresh and dry first taste.
8491,1166848,Medium medium plus acidity but good mouthfeel. Good fruit and juicy without any RS
8492,1166848,"Rosé by huge and famous producer. Unexpectedly simple sweet smell of yellow sugar candy with some strawberry caramel. On palate lean, even with some austerity, slightly yeasty and a bit oily, but impeccable fresh. Interesting mix of white nectarine and slight bitterness of guelder-rose berries. Quite peculiar and undoubtedly quality and good assembled rosé. Nicely paired with young goat cheese. Aeration recommended."
8493,1166848,Long and persistent rose
8494,1166848,Very grassy. Wood and leather on the back of the mouth. Interesting but can't decide if I like it
8495,1166848,Surprising full bodied rose! Good even for meats. Something else than Province roses.

8498,1166848,This was a lovely rosé wine with a lot of tase and very much flavour. Was perfect match to grilled bacalao with nice vegetables.
8499,7565016,"92/100  The Mestre Daniel XXVI Talhas, Talha X is a blend of Antão Vaz, Diagalves, Perrum, Roupeiro, and Manteúdo from one single Talha (amphora). Notes of sweet peach, chamomile tea, tangerine, and pineapple with a touch of chalk. This is a wine that shows concentration beyond what the alcohol level (11.5%) suggests. Generous fruit on the mouth which has many layers of texture. This has more richness, tannin, and staying power than the standard ‘Branco’ bottling. Long finish."
8500,1855353,"Dark burgundy color, rich aroma of red fruits and tobacco. Long lasting taste of read fruits and some spices."
8501,1855353,"Nicely balanced, with well integrated fruit, tobacco and earth, none of the elements overpowering the other."

8507,1855353,It’s really a good wine  
8508,1855353,Very strong and complex.  Interesting balance. Some fruits in aroma.  Little bitter.  In some points still sharp.  It is good to leave it for 3 or more years.
8509,1855353,"Rich, fruit, plums and berries. Some vanilla  Long finish "
8510,1855353,If there was a perfect wine then this is it! Had it with a suckling pig in Lisbon and it was unforgettable. Get your hands on this wine. 
8511,1855353,"Heavy, full-bodied red with dried cherry aroma, smoke, good complexity and very harmonic and rounded. Velvety texture. Long finish. Can't stop enjoying it! Good value. "

8517,1367315,Heavy and rich. Good alcohol content. As someone else said-reminiscent of a port. Excellent full bodied wine! 2016 at ASDA under £7 great value-paid £35 in a hotel in Majorca.

8520,1367315,Quite rich with a dark body. Slightly reminiscent of a port but with a pleasant fruity aftertaste
8521,2515323,"A very nice Rose, it has quite a pronounced red fruits and berries nose and also in mouth, with some herbaceous touch. Rests long in mouth and is quite different than a Provence one. Recommend "
8522,2515323,"Touriga nacional rosé. Made to be a rosé and not from leftovers. Strawberry, cherry, a bit herbaceous but fresh and great for summer."
8523,2515323,"Very fresh and balanced. Strawberry, melon and some citrus aromas. Tried with avocado/prawn cocktail"
8524,2515323,"100% Touriga Nacional, quite straight forward, lack of intrigue and complexity :-)  Aroma - mango, ananas Taste - grapefruit, roses Acidity - high Alco - 12.5% After taste - 5-6 sec  Overpriced in Riga - 15 EUR/bottle"

Freshly fruited w. blackberry, black cherry, cassis & a touch of chocolate. Silky, harmonious m+ tannins, m+ acidity & bright red & black berries to a m+ finish."
8537,1678254,Outstanding example of a touriga nacional.
8538,1678254,"Good mixture of fruity and tannin. Berries, refreshing acidity with a little bit herbal flavor. Typical Portuguese red, but contains enough complexity."
8539,1678254,"4.2 Ruby red but not clear. Unfiltered? Defect? Dark fruit (plum, blackberries), licorice, and cedar. Balanced. Nice complexity. Finish: Medium(+) length. Tasted in a flight of 4 Portuguese wines. "
8540,1678254,"Backlog from spring 2020. The last wine from the first round of this wonderful line of Cortes de Cima. I always liked these wines a lot. Maybe the least exciting as it's quite ""common"" grape for me but nevertheless it's always a great pleasure to taste a good TN. Ruby purple colour with a bouquet of blackberry, plum, well integrated spicy background, some tiny flowery nuances. Medium-bodied, medium acidity and medium+bodied. Very firm tannins. Complex flavours similar to aromas plus dark chocolate, vanilla."
8541,1678254,"Deep red but rather cloudy. Nose shows blue berry and cherry, perhaps with a hint if tar. Rich mouthfeel, with less tannin than I was expecting, and so less grip. Fruit forward. Slightly lacking structure, although very gentle tannins appear at mid palate to give gentle length. "
8542,1678254,"Spicy, peppered aroma when first opened with initial tight and dry finish.  Given some time, opens nicely with fruit accents and easier on the palette (not so dry).  Me likes especially for the value.  Just finished off with Greek BBQ chicken, Greek salad and garlic bread.  A must!  "
8543,1678254,Execente custo beneficio 
8544,1678254,"Delicious!  Opening beautifully, revealing the source of all the wonderful flavors that Port delivers. Exploding with flavor."
8545,1678254,"I discovered the portuguese grape variety 'Turiga National' and I fell in love with this red Wine. Intense nose of small fruits, berry and flowers. This one has a very well balanced acidity and structure, soft tannins and a great drinkability."
8546,1678254,Cherry  Coffee Leather 
8547,1678254,Another well-structured offering from Cortes de Cima...this winner hailing from 2007. The varietal is a deep extracted touriga nacional and you know it with its fleshy pepper body and long finish. Pair with BBQed pork cuts and spicy chocolate fudge for desert.
8548,1678254,"Purple colour to it, oak and dark fruit on the nose. Tasted BlackBerry, blueberry, oak, with a little spice on the finish. Tannins present but well balanced. For this single varietal I was expecting something a little more robust but perhaps it’s more Malbec than Cab Sav. Enjoyable bottle, not outstanding though."
8549,1678254,"Nice juicy, some herbs from Syrah, strenght and structure from petit verdot and touriga to make it real Portugese. Especially after a few years, showing full potential. Lovely! \n"
8550,1678254,Cinnamon accents provide a zesty essence to the cherry tart and plum flavors. Dried herbal tones on the tannic finish. 
8551,1164787,The 5th really good wine we tasted in one night.. How Portuguese wines have evolved over the years.. great body and beautifully layered.. 4.2 stars

8567,1497327,"4.1 Top Dao example. Still not the peak. Dark inky color, the notes of blackberry, cassis, plum, graphite, spices, black pepper, dark chocolate. Full body, powerful, solid structure, fresh, ripe, complex, very long aftertaste. "
8568,1497327,"Full body, pleasant tannins. Some fruit and a bit weak in the nose"
8569,1497327,"Intense nose of black fruit, berries and spices with rather high acidity on the palate "
8570,1497327,I’m not getting this wine it seems. 95 p from old man Parker but all I’m getting are overwhelming tannins and not nearly enough fruit. Body and finish are top notch though. Can it be the relatively young age? 
8571,1497327,Warm and rich nose contrasting with crisp apalate. Pretty high acidity and medium tannins. Lacks balance in my view.
8572,1497327,"Green nose , dark berries, tabacco and chocolate on the palate,  smooth tannins   A possitive surprise"

8577,1497327,A very typical wine from Dao

A field blend from the Esmoitada vineyard of 30+ varieties, notably Touriga Nacional, Jaen, Tinta Roriz, Rufete, Alfrocheiro etc. 80yo vines.  Deep purple. Rich & concentrated w. blackberry, black cherry, black raspberry, creamy oak spice & smoky vanilla. Developing w. leather & tobacco.  Dry. Rich black fruit, vanilla, cocoa & red berry freshness. Light oxy spice. High alc, m+ fine tannins, m+ acid & a long finish w. damson confit & bramble."
8579,1497327,Black fruit and cherry aromas with light vanilla aromas and liquorice on the palate. A very balanced body... Needs to breath for a couple of hours. This is a very good wine from the Dao region.  
8580,1497327,Very good. Very balanced and drinkable. Full of caracther and minerality. Will last a long time but it's drinking superbly well now. It's one of those wines that needs a few minutes to clean up on the nose and then... Wow.

8596,1167352,Nice and sweet but with a clear sharpness
8597,1167352,"🍷 In the glass, a shimmering red with pink and purple hues   👃 In the sniffy sniff, blackcurrant cassis, dark cherries and baked plums are entwined with notes of biscuits, toasted bread and freshly cut grass   👅 In the mouth, tannin packed and spicy but a bit thin, flavours of blackcurrants, blackberries and dark chocolate are present, alongside burnt coffee, sherbet, jalapeno and black pepper   🥂 definitely much better on day 2, much sweeter and more viscous with a nicer finish"
8598,1167352,Decent wine for the price. Good depth of colour and nose. Not a great deal of length on the finish.

8603,1167352,"Mature dark plum, clove an allspice. Soft, thick and simmery... some almonds and plum in taste.... a little dessert on it's own... "
8604,1167352,Goes well with risalamande (hint: cherries all over)
8605,1167352,"Tasty, it can't be bad when you look forward to your next glass. Lovely chocolate flavour. Great value too at under £10. Try it"
8606,1167352,"Quite impressed by this, great deep color and fantastic taste.. Everything you wan't in a LBV!"
8607,1167352,"A nice LBV, a bit of a subdued nose due to most of the aromas being towards the heavier end, chocolate, clove, prune, quite spirity, all similar on the palate. Full bodied, sweet, medium soft tannins. Medium length finish that's quite fruity but has a note of black grape skins that now I think of it is surprisingly unusual to find in wine given how it's made! 🤔"
8608,1167352,"More free booze. I'm on a journey with Porto, not to Porto of course, but through its bottles, bequeathed to me by Colm 'hands on' L some months previous. And so, slouched in the larder I'm developing an appreciation of the Portuguese. For once, literature is disregarded. This dark sugary cousin of Sauternes is a marked improvement on their ruby version, which was shite."
8609,1167352,"Good dark ruby colour. Intense aromas and flavours. Shows dark fruits and cocoa nicely. A little on the drier side, for Port, with grippy tannins and firm acidity. Finish hangs on while bringing a little warmth. Quite nice. Might seek this one out again."
8610,1167352,"Raisins on the nose, very sweet plum primary with figs and walnuts on the aftertaste"
8611,91095,"Round 2 in the blends v single grapes challenge with @[1|21994377|- Dan -], @[1|29011840|Mr Kevvy] & @[1|7459024|Scottoz] and I’m staying with 2016 Portuguese reds with 2 from the Douro.  Much darker fruits than the Alentejo duo, with blackcurrant, brambles & black cherry along with some light spice, aniseed and bitter chocolate. Good tannic structure and balanced acidity.  The Vivino average of 3.9⭐️ is spot on for me."
8612,91095,"Warm fruity scent, mature red fruits, long aftertaste"
8613,91095,Liked this wine . Medium bodied very smooth to drink 
8614,91095,"Floral and black pepper tones on the nose, the body isn’t in sync with the nose, although it’s quite enjoyable. Light bodied, smooth and plum.  "
8615,91095,"Lovely wine and good value. Tart & tangy Black fruit - blueberries, blackberries and hints of pie spice (anise, cinnamon), vanilla. Very dry, long finish. "
8616,91095,"Very nice wine. New, light and tasty for a very good price. "

8622,91095,1st! Light and easy drinkable! Comparing to the Touriga Franca one this wine is less bodied and has some acid flavour in the end!

8624,91095,"Let it air a bit. You have the flavour from the start, but the aroma needs a bit of time. Dark berries and some chocolate. An accomplished wine. "
8625,91095,"Vinho que superou as expectativas. Com requinte, frutuoso na boca e final prolongado."

8627,3190986,"9m in French oak, little of jammy flavours. "
8628,3190986,"A very full bodied, high in tannins wine, it’s it’s just too much Touriga Nacional for a simple tasting. You really need some fatty food to appreciate it. "
8629,3190986,"Bold, medium high tannin, blueberry, blackberry, vanilla. "
8630,3190986,"I think that's it's a bit too young, still enjoyable with violets, chocolate and vanilla b but tannins are a bit too much."

This is sweet but it’s a sweet that has been well matured, the tannins not too dry. A sweet wine with a good level of acidity and no excess of oak.  Wine of the Night Vintages 2015 (5,1) Very good, very soft, but then that's what Vintages is about: very soft, very smooth and easy to drink."

The powerful nose spread scents of dark fruits, cedar, dark chocolate, coffee, licorise and a splash of vanilla.  On the full bodied palate a reflection of the black fruits all nicely mixed with smooth tannins and a low acidity that offers me a long finish.  This rock needs food and helps you to forget the cold winter eve. 3.9🌟"
8637,3190986,"(4,1) This is in an excellent place now, with age having tamed the tannins and rougher edges of the wine. Richly fruity, like confiture, but then without the sweetness. Ripe brambles, cherries, blackcurrant. Vanilla. Violets, mint, smoke and dark chocolate. Excellent acidity. Good amount of tannins too, but very smooth and integrated."
8638,3190986,"Bold Douro wine. Tasting notes of oak, cherry and dark berries. Was very nice years ago. Still very good."

Paired extremely well with baked pork ribs with orange. The wine stood up to the pepper purée and tomato sauce. Outstandingly yummy.

8664,75996,"The finisher 🍷 from Saturday night.  I am not a port ambassador but this was an amazing drop.   At 23 yrs young : The fruit depth , the long long finish and great balance brought this vivino guy a huge smile.  Bottom line, need to find more vintage port  👍"
8665,75996,"Old bretty character, someone light vegetal like medicinal plants on nose, much better mouth than nose, it is a rich port with spicy character, it really needs time to show itself with some fresh notes, not sure it will go further in time -  #portwineday #winelover"
8666,75996,"Great Vintage Port! At this stage more like a good smooth and mellow Tawny both in colour and taste. Dried fruit, fig, caramel are ruling the palate."
8667,75996,"An enjoyable port, all be it still very young. Will certainly age well, so will certainly keep my other bottle for a good few years to come. "

8676,1142829,Well developed but will peak in another 5-10 years.
8677,1142829,there's an underlying rich exotic fruitiness to this muted nose with lots of acidity which doesn't detract from a well balanced spicy and complete palate and a finish that just keeps going on.
8678,1142829,"Was very good, price was good as it was recorked in 2016,"
8679,1142829,"Mature vintage port. Pale tawny. Exciting bouquet, tobacco, leather, cinnamon, kirsch, mushroom. Pure on the palate, with 1982's softness and sweetness. Prune, cherry, milk chocolate, cedar. Quite a lot of acidity. Still has a good backbone in this forward year. This is lovely, must be one of the best ports of the vintage. Many producers declared '83 instead of '82. Well done to Sandeman. Historic and healing."
8680,1142829,"Quite anonymous in the nose, but the taste is amazing. Still young and with some power, velvet aftertaste - smooth and long, some sweetness"

Beautiful complex nose with sweet, dried fruit (raisins, prunes, burnt figs), walnuts,sweet tobacco, dark chocolate, some sweet alcohol and a whiff of oak.

Well balanced.  11-"

8692,1666356,"Plum, Mulberry and charred bourbon cask oak on the rich and velvety nose. When it opens up the nose goes more towards cedar. Think fruity palate with solid wood and a mild balanced medium finish. "
8693,1666356,"One of our favourite Portuguese table wines. Nice balance, not too fruity and with a dustiness that reminds me of hiking along the Southwestern coast - enjoyed it tonight with Chicken Piri-piri "
8694,1666356,"Some acidity and dryness I didn’t expect (before looking at the label, “only” 13%, lower than many reds from this region).  A more elegant/lighter body than many red blends from Portugal. Try this wine before other (fuller) reds.  I added half a star because of the PQ ratio."
8695,1666356,"I find great value in Portuguese wines, this one is no exception. On the nose some cherrywood and vanilla. On the palate, dark cherries, blackberries, blueberries, a little oak. Good mouth feel and decent finish - all for under $20. CDN. 👍👍🍷"

"
8704,1538909,"Very interesting high level Encruzado, plenty of oak on this. Kind of like a buttery Chardonnay mixed with Assyrtiko! Some lemon peel slightly grippy finish too. "
8705,1538909,"One of the best Encruzado from Portugal. Very complex with delicate and discreet of peach, lemon, passion fruit, lychee, jasmine, orange blossom and lemon balm. Balanced with vibrant acidity. The wine has a very high aging potential, rich, textured and structured. Very long finish "
8706,1538909,"Superb Délicate, but intense Super long finish, retro back of mouth and œsophage Superb balance acidity and fat (oily texture) Started with wood, then a chenin  with more texture, iode notes, flowers and fruits, keep evolving Pear skins, apple skins"
8707,1538909,"Maybe a 4.3 in terms of things I like. However, this is one of the most complex wines I’ve ever tried. Pale lemon color. Promover nose: lime, nutty, salt, oak, toast, white flowers. Dry, high acidity, medium body, medium alcohol, long finish. Palate follows on the nose with some orange notes. Outstanding wine! I am just speechless "
8708,1538909,Great with roasted turbot or lobster. Wonderful touch of smoke and great acidity. Bought in Portugal for around £30. Well worth the price

8711,1538909,"Absolutely Spectacular. These wines will take Dão way up of the premium wines ladder. Great fruit intensity and balanced and reasonable use of wood on a very fresh, unctuous but mineral and white stony profile. Great clean length and will be an interesting wine to follow its ageing!"
8712,1538909,"4.1 ⭐️ and the one of the most complex white wines I have ever tasted. Pale lemon in colour. Pronounced nose with salt (super intense), lemon, nutty, oak, toast. On the palate it is dry with high acidity, medium alcohol, medium+ body with great finesse, pronounced intensity (lots of orange notes) and long finish. "
8713,1538909,"Splendid white from Dão! This exquisite white is a perfumed and elegant Encruzado from 40y old vines, fermented with skin contact (“curtimenta”) and aged 9m in 600L oak barrels (1/3 new), with battonage. Fruity and complex, with smooth texture, crisp acidity and great length. Golden yellow color, floral, pineapple and citrus aromas/flavors, with notes of mineral salinity and well integrated oak.

8720,4270764,"Very enjoyable Alvarinho that shows its time on lees and partly in wood with a beautiful extra layer of complexity.

8724,4270764,"91/100 Part of this wine was aged in wood for five months. The wood comes out here and adds a nice highlight to the lemon, white peach, dandelion, and mineral notes. It’s fuller in body than the standard bottling with more concentration. I bet this ages well as all the components come together. It’s delicious now, but could be a whopper with time in the bottle. "
8725,4270764,Smooth and dry - my friend said it’s a bit of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay - Very neutral  lemon peach minerals - has everything
8726,4270764,"4* for this Vinho Verde wine. Extraordinary and complex aroma focused on fruits, flowers and oak. In the mouth dry and fresh wine with notes of fruits, flowers and spices.

8758,1660614,"Full body, great value,"
8759,1660614,"Dark red, heavy legs, dry, acidic, black cherry, slight bitter aftertaste "
8760,1660614,Excellent accompaniment to a great steak!
8761,1709173,"Dry, strawberry based rose with some orange, ginger, medium to low acidity and refreshing finish. Really nice with Portuguese soft sheep cheese Azeitao, also solid with baked codfish and salty sides."
8762,1709173,Not generally a fan of Rose but this is an absolute belter! Strawberry but not overly sweet.. highly recommended! 
8763,1709173,"Light flowery nose; distinct strawberries and butter in the palate - the former are also in the finish (it is fairly long). Sour and bitter twists in the palate, interesting. Just short of benchmark rose though - 3.75-"
8764,1709173,Agradavel frescor. Mais info no blog
8765,1709173,Amber colour 12.5. Watermelon on nose. Plenty of acid and moderate alcohol. 
8766,1709173,"Very gastronomic rosé, clean and fresh with a crisp strawberry driven profile, good acidity and just enough complexity to make it interesting. Simple yet really well made Alentejo rosé!"
8767,1709173,Ollie and James at Izzys
8768,1709173,"Full bodied, well composed. Red wine character. "
8769,1709173,"Competent wine, not too tasty. I would add to the blend some moscatel or similar to add swiftness. Never less good for an afternoon lunch."
8770,1709173,Did not expect this much power from a rosé. Beautiful dense aromas and a length that deserves recognition. Possibly the best rosé I ever had - if there’s such a thing... 
8771,1709173,A nice and dry one. Light taste of strawberries with a refreshing palate. Prima vera agora!
8772,1709173,"The Best Rosé so far. Incredible surprise to find peach, mineral and red fruits notes. Good intensity and freshness. Dry and fat. Amazing"
8773,1709173,"50 % Touriga Nacional and 50 % Aragonez.  In the glass a bright pink, salmon color.  On the nose intense aromas of strawberries, peach and orange flint with hints of violets and herbs.  On the palate well balanced with nice acidity and freshness. Not too light but with a certain fatness in it. It has a medium light spicy finish."
8774,1709173,"Opening a bottle I noticed a pink salmon color with aromas of red fruits and gentle spice notes.  The palate showed light fruit, not overwhelming, tastes of strawberries and a hint of cherries, dry with the right balance of tannins and acidity. The wine needed to be slightly chilled. The finish was medium with slight spicy ending. Drink now while it’s fresh. This wine was a gift from my colleague, Amandio, a native of Portugal, who brought back this gem from one of his trips back home. Gratíssimo!"
8775,1709173,Nice wine to drink. Red berries on the nose. Some spicy ness as well. Medium to light mouthfeel with some acidity.
8776,1809963,I’m used to the great quality of these vines. This vintage still need some more years to be at its best... but who want to wait🤪
8777,1809963,84:100                                                               Yep               That’s                 So             ✅🥄🍾🦆
8778,1809963,Vintage 2018: very nice and palate pleasing Alejanto. The high alcohol percentage will make it even better in the next few years. Was perfect with our hummer.
8779,1809963,"Delicious. Super well made. Medium weight, super balanced, stone fruit, persistent without being dull "
8780,1809963,"Apple up front, both on the nose and the palate. "
8781,1809963,Elegant and balanced. I had it at restaurant Azenhas do mar
8782,1809963,Fresh but powerful
8783,1809963,Super by vis 
8784,1809963,Medium body with long finish. Fresh with peach and melon aromas
8785,1809963,"Flavored, not flowered, intense, great south white wine, easy to drink."
8786,1809963,"Very fruity, pineapple and a hint of caramel "
8787,1809963,"Drinkable but not memorable.  Is it age, is it too much wine, or is it that this was a pleasant run of the mill white wine. Anyway whatever the case we came, we saw and we drank. Cheers. "
8788,1809963,"On the nose, citrus, melon, pineapple and stone fruits. Subtle vanilla cream notes Very fresh and fruity with tropical fruits of melon and pineapple. Also yellow peach and apricot Lemon vanilla cream on the finish, which does end a little short But a good accompaniment with pork "
8789,1809963,Needs to be decanted for an hour before enjoying. Good to have with food instead of by itself. Deep red colour and a medium to full body. Taste and aroma of  vanilla oak blackberry pepper  raspberry cherry blackcurrant
8790,1809963,Started the evening with this Portuguese white. Nice and crisp body with lemon predominantly present on the palate. This is followed by some orange and apple to give this one smooth but little dry finish 
8791,1598254,"Fresh and rich nose - smells like it has some maturity, though hard to describe what I mean. The palate is rich and acidic, with strawberry (ripe, possibly even cooked) and oak. Really nice rose which tastes like a really quality white."
8792,1598254,"89/100 It is Touriga Nacional aged in oak for six months. Complex and developed nose. It smells like an aged white wine. Notes of natural gas, strawberry, and pepper. This has light fruit flavors and high acidity. It’s highly structured for a rosé, long finish. Light amount of tannins."
8793,1598254,"Salmon color ... red fruit ... minerals ... oak ... res.sugar 0,6 g/l ... grapes of Touriga Nacional ... heavier type of Rose wine ... i like it"
8794,1598254,"Chemical on the nose in a good way Light, good balance Touriga nacional At winery"
8795,1598254,"#outubrorosanovivino #umbrindeàprevencão For this prevention campaign against breast cancer, I chose this amazing portuguese rosé made from Touriga Nacional grapes. Limpid salmon color with cupper glances. Nose of red fruits as cherries and strawberries with smoked and floral notes. In mouth, fresh, refreshing with  vivid structure. Ellegant red fruit flavors wrapped in floral and mineral structure, good body and acidity with challenging tannins and remarkable red fruit lingering aftertaste. Cheers!"
8796,1598254,One of the best roses I've ever tasted Very dry and needs food
8797,1598254,"Dry, bitter, paired greatly with cheese and aged smoky, cured meats. Earthy tannins with root-based flavors and hints of pears."
8798,1598254," Salmon color. Very fragrant wine, floral aroma, with light smoky notes.  In the mouth it is textured, dry and intense, with iodinated notes  Very long finish. A wine that stands out and surprises who proves it."
8799,1598254,"Salmon color proves to be elegant and outstanding in texture, with delicate fruit and minerality. On the nose it is perfumed, flowery with light smoky notes, white chocolate and white cherry. The test is full of texture and finesse, dry, mineral, juicy and long."
8800,1598254,"Superb Alentejo rose....great fruity & fresh taste, well balanced & easy going. Really good....cheers! 🥂"
8801,1598254,A classic good rose but nothing special about it 
8802,1598254,"I was surprised to find a rose this great from Portugal. This wine is up there with best rose wines from Bandol. Great body, dry and makes an excellent companion to sea food. "
8803,1598254,Oaky nose. Smooth finish and dry for a Rose 
8804,1598254,"Super fatty fruity rosé,  the one I was looking for this summer."
8805,1598254,Definitely one of the best Rose I ever had.

8815,1240432,"Deep glossy red color  The nose full with notes of mint, black plums, black mulberry and extensive floral notes of violet, and finally some fine cedar and graphite notes. A heavy and complex nose, but still sophisticated  The pallate full of blackberry, plum, mulberry and black raspberry, warm spices, and fine cedar. Exceptionally smooth and rounded tannins supported with juicy acidity in the almost perfect harmony and ballance  Fine and long aftertaste full of ripe black fruits, vanilla and cedar 4.7"
8816,1240432,"Very rich and interesting wine. Needs decanting in my view, as tannins develop and soften over long time while being in a glass Eye: bold and intense ruby Nose: jam, truffle, potato, red currant bush, butter, meat notes, herbs, dried cherry Acidity: above average Taste: fruit kernels, bilberry Finish is long and developing from drawing persimmon to apple, herbs and tea with currant jam "
8817,1240432,"This is decent juice, that’s for sure!!  A fine bouquet of raspberries, cassis and some red currant jam, a little cigar box and horse saddle. Layered on the palate, complex, in balance and with a great aftertaste. I would leave this in the cellar for 10 more years. Curious what this wine will generate on the tertiary aromas... 4,3⭐️ for now..."
8818,1240432,"World class wine. Black fruit jam, black cherry, cassis, flowers, vanilla, cloves, ultra fine dense tannins, long, elegant and concentrated."
8819,1240432,"Dark red color with hints of purple. Red berries, spices, oak at the nose. Good length. Red berries like raspberry in the finish."
8820,1240432,Wow! A magic taste with the prune after-taste and flavours. 
8821,4258195,"Deep ruby red colour with violet rim. Complex nose with pronounced aromas of ripe blackcurrants, blackberries, herbaceous, vanilla and oak. Dry with full-bodied and rounded well integrated tannins. In the mouth explodes aromas of ripe black fruits and licorice. Medium long length "
8822,4258195,Good but not totally my style
8823,4258195,Very delicious and different in a good crispy way!
8824,4258195,"Very bold, very intense red from Dão. Deep ruby red color, with a fruity nose, but a spicy, pepper finish. Notes of blackberries and oak. Very enjoyable!"
8825,4258195,"Deep purple colour. Aromas and flavours of black cherry, black plum, blackcurrant herbs and spicy oak notes. The tannins come out a bit unripe and due to this the wine lacks some balance as well as intensity, complexity and length. Still, this Touriga Nacional is a good food match at a favourable price.  "
8826,4258195,"A rather nice good value food-friendly Touriga nacional on the lighter and fresher scale. Pretty and fragrant nose. Quite pleasant and inviting. At first herbal, perfumed tea and with air more spicy, with a sweet dark LBV port dried fruit note. On the palate it works for me best with food. Without it lacks some depth but with a rich lent, tomato, sausage stew it went really well. Juicy fresh very crisp forest berry fruit, leafy and earthy, good acidity and light body. A versatile food wine!"
8827,4258195,Casa Américo Touriga Nacional 2012.   A:  What I like about the Casa Américo brand of Rioja is the way the winemakers use only French and Spanish oak.  Not many of the Riojas I've had use oak barrels (not even in the blends).  So I was surprised when I was given a bottle of Casa Américo Touriga Nacional to try. From Wikipedia:  The wine has a pale straw colour and is aged in new and older American oak barrels. It is composed of 60% tempranillo and 40% merlot.
8828,4258195,"88/100 Another outstanding Dão for the price. Noted of black tea, pine, black raspberry, and earth. Medium bodied and juicy with soft tannins. This tastes younger than it is. It’s amazing how different the Portuguese grapes taste from the Dão on comparison to other regions."
8829,4258195,"Pleasant surprise, found it in a tasting. Around 25 pound.  Big nose full of black fruit, French spices coffee and liquorice. In mouth is big, powerful and long. Delicious with game."
8830,4258195,"Blueberries, violets, earth and herbs. Firm and balanced. Decent wine."
8831,4258195,Once again the wife started belting out some musical show tunes. Meanwhile I thought this wine was nice and quite like a Malbec in body. BIG
8832,4258195,"Tbd, fresh, peppery, but thin; shimmering surface and no depth. 2nd tasting, 15th april 18: A lighter fare touriga, nothing at all like the ports, but pleasant and I'm going for 3.5 instead of 3. Fair value."
8833,4258195,"Mid to full bodied. Plum, guava, ripe strawberry, cherry. Slate. Chalk. Graphite. Light undertones of oak and cola.  On the palate, tannins are silky smooth.  Acidity is nice and refreshing.  A tad saline.  91 points Wine Spectator.  Makes sense. 2012 is ready now ! "
8834,4258195,"Love the Dao region wines, complex, dry and fruity. You can really tell the oaky aroma in this one, was just a bit too accidic for my taste, but great quality for the price!"
8835,4258195,Giving it 4 for the value. Lovely finish and very refreshing.
8836,18529,"Superb. Excellent structure and balanced acidity. Medium long finish. Dry but not excessively, very floral, full of red fruit. Recommended. "
8837,18529,"Bought in loco. Blackberries jam, full-bodied, intense. I’ve expected a bit more from oak but that’s ok. Cheers!"
8838,18529,2013. A special vintage. No regrets. 
8839,18529,Lovely Blend from Setubal. Still very good Vintage
8840,18529,"Black current, black berry, strawberry, plum, black pepper chili, and leather"
8841,18529,"I hope this was just a bad bottle and we were unlucky because I enjoy a lot other wines from Bacalhoa. Unfortunately this one is a hard pass. It's not corked and the wine doesn't seem spoiled but the acidity (and overwhelming sediment) is unpleasant. Giving a 2.5 for my own recollection, will try another bottle after covid, probably focus on younger vintages."
8842,18529,"Fruity with strong hints of plum, very palatable with a peppery and dry finish."
8843,18529,"Outstanding Portuguese wine from Peninsula de Setubal. Well balanced Bordeaux blend, fruity, full body, lots of caracter! Amazing pairing with duck leg! CHEERS! "
8844,18529,Great wine from Setubal Portugal it is the third time that I taste this but first time that I taste a 2014 vintage a gift of a friend! Nice Bordeaux cut.
8845,18529,"Of very deep red color, it is powerful and very concentrated on the alluring nose, with intense flavors of raspberries combined with savory roasted scents of espresso , spice cake,mint and dried blueberry fruit, all well- defined with a full , complex, fresh and elegant structure. "
8846,18529,Very good wine
8847,18529,The bouquet is perfect.
8848,18529,"Very nice Bordeaux blend! On the nose plums, leather and wood. On the mouth nice tannins and good acidity. Nota 4.3"
8849,18529,Just fantastic Reasonably good structure on this red Very rich with soft juicy tannins.. full bodied
8850,18529, oak plum vanilla chocolate oak chocolate coffee blackcurrant plum dark fruit
8851,2187145,"One of thebest arinto i ve tasted. A supreme work with the grape,leaving the acidity but with not too much tanine. 12° is good enough. A nice fish risoto and the day is won"
8852,2187145,Amazing structure. Nose of honey and ripe figs. Palate with hints of guava and rosehip. 
8853,2187145,Apple and oak nose. Smooth mouthfeel. More Apple on the palate. Hubby found it too strong. 
8854,2187145,Nice patio wine. Didn’t work all that well with pork and a chilli rub but that was my fault. 
8855,2187145,"100 native Portuguese grape Arinto 😋 Sweet peach, ripe apricot. Complex body with nice refreshing acidity. Nice weekend-starter!"
8856,2187145,Peach easy to drink
8857,2187145,Still a huge arinto but the 2015 is much better
8858,2187145,"Silverstone Grand Prix, race is back on.  👃 fantastic, rich but not imposing, tropical, with lots of papaya and mango with a touch of honey and oak.  👃 elegant, dry, with a certain specific taste like bourbon, medium acidity and  a normal afretaste. "
8859,2187145,"Arinto is usually used in Vinho Verde blend to provide acidity, but I might aswell try this monovarietal wine. Explosion of pear, wet stones and cantaloupe on the nose. Stingy lime citrus palate. Ends floral and mineralic. Some will claim it is ubalanced, but I think it's allright. I'm not thriving for the bitter element that is clearly missing. Enjoyable."
8860,2187145,"Aromatic, citric, feels as it had oak although it doesn't. Nice and fresh, with good body."
8861,2187145,Nice smooth leverage meaningful yalowbatiof but wrinkles in moonlight stars for sflelowf 
8862,2187145,"Superb white, notes of vanilla and cinnamon. Good dry acidity and smooth"
8863,2187145,"Vinninova Master Class Łódź 09.2019 Opis wkrótce. The Note will come later. 3,5"
8864,2187145,"Good flavors and aromas of fruit (citrus fruit), some floral, some minerals. Yellow, greenish color, with moderate acidity. Ligth. Medium dry/sweet. Overall, on the olfactory / gustatory level its a pleasant wine. However it's not my style of wines.  I found the notes very alien.  The vineyard and terroir seemed to me to be overshadowed by the winery... I prefer a more natural style... Contains sulphites. 13,5.º alcohol.  "
8865,2187145,"[@ Alentejo at CCB 13-14/10/2017] Not convinced about this one - has that lemony Arinto acidity but seems to be missing something, some structure, some 'togetherness'. Though perhaps I am somewhat prejudiced here by a preference for Bucelas Arinto. (13% abv)."
8866,1646861,"Did I say that drinking wine in Portugal is an automatic +0.5*?😅 ok jokes aside, full bodied delight. Chocolate and cherries on the nose. Eucalyptus on the palate. Dry oaky finish to sweep you off the feet and making crave another sip. "
8867,1646861,"Very good Dão region wine, cherries, chocolate, pepper, vanilla, a bit rough at beginning, I let it decanter for more 20 minutes, then much better. Bold, deep red and purple tones, long taste. Perfect with red meat, taste it with veal ribs and potatoes. "
8868,1646861,Always worth trying one more time...
8869,1646861,"Intense, lots of sediments, rounded"
8870,1646861,"Delicious especially in Portugal! Nice and dry, cherry notes."
8871,1646861,"Aromatic start, chocolate liquorice, smooth long mild acid finish- @Casa da Insua"
8872,1646861,"Full bodied, smooth, fruity hints but more chocolate. Delightful on its own or to enhance your meal"
8873,1646861,"Dry, slightly hot, a touch of oak with hint of ripe berries "
8874,1646861,Its a reasonable wine. Can be enjoyed ocassionaly. 
8875,1646861,Fruity fresh white
8876,1646861,"Young stark and irreverent...  Great Try it out,  Touriga Nacional,  Cabernet Sauvignon and Rabigato,  where lease than in the Dão UNIQUE enjoy..."
8877,1646861,"Intenso, taninos suaves"
8878,1646861,Well aged through maturity. Lovely blend.
8879,1646861,"Made to prematurely show up in the market, this traditional Dão blend is very pleasant and easy to enjoy"
8880,1646861,Great great great wine! And not expensive!
8881,5670340,"A golden yellow. Intriguing wine, full of interest a buttery sparkling which tricks you into thinking it will taste of Champagne but had an Alvinhro after taste full of interest for a picnic "
8882,5670340,"Lovely natural (PetNat) white Vinho Verde from northern Portugal 🇵🇹 Soalheiro makes this delicious juice with 100 % Alvarinho 🍇 A bit cloudy in the glass with orange, lemon, yeast, cheese, ginger, minerals and grapefruit 🥂 light body and high acidity 👏👏 "
8883,5670340,"One more from Soalheiro. PetNat (ancestral method) this time. All natural. All good.   L: Light beer color, pretty viscous for a fizz, very active bubbles vanishing fast. N: Dried apples, yeast at the beginning. Mango, pineapple, citrus. Dusty notes. Fresh minerals up during the breathing process.  P: Very dry, mineral, salty. Crispy acidity. Quince, dried apple, orange. Cleansing power with refreshing aftertaste.  Good aperitif. Nice sole sipper. Strong 3,8 from our table ready to dine. "
8884,5670340,"This was a new line of Soalheiro that I didn’t know, I think I prefer the traditional Alvarinho made by them!"
8885,5670340,The gift that just give more and more over time in the glass!
8886,5670340,"medium gold,  apple,  lemon,  peach,   herbal. Very interesting wine"
8887,5670340,"Fully orange juice aroma with but of herbal touch, bit fizzy feeling, floral sense like lily, bit sticky texture, green apple emotion, citrus acidity, medium body. Clean finish with lemon feeling. Good match with fermented seafood. Bit stronger than I thought, but still characteristic. Not bad. "
8888,5670340,"Vino verde + natural vinification = awesomeness. Super delicious juicy aromas of yellow grapefruit, apple, lemon plus some funk but no CO2. Not too cloudy so also not too much yeast left which makes it very easy to consume. With 13% Alcohol quite the Party starter but not unpleasantly sharp in the taste. Love it!"
8889,5670340,"Great Vinho Verde! I'm not a huge fan of those wines but this one really opened me up... Fantastic body, rich, funky, some tree fruits such as pear and apple, some minerals and earthy flavours, a bit of honey, and even some citrus zest... Really developed through the evening..."
8890,5670340,"This has a feel of cider apples at first, turning to chamomile tea with rice in the glass. R with the ancestral method, so no disgorgment out dosage here. Also made without the user of sulphur. An organic natural sparkling wine."
8891,5670340,"[Portugal Collection Tasting] The other big name in Vinho Verde was doubly represented. First this ‘Nature’ which means no sulfites were added not filtering performed. I found the nose a bit disappointing with the typical Alvarinho aroma dominated by yoghurt...  In the mellow, chubby (?) palate plenty acidity but not the most crispy kind, wet stone, green apple and citrus. 3.2"
8892,5670340," The “natural” vinho verde version of this house.  No sulphur, unfiltered, some maceration gives intense colour to the wine... Kiwi yoghurt in the nose and Granny Smith apple going full throttle on the palate, sour rhubarb too... Be careful with this high acidity, this is quite stern.  Perhaps some air will do wonders..."
8893,5670340,NB there's also a sparkling version/variant of this wine (NPT Bruto - see my 15 June 2019) that Vivino may or may not have added to its database.
8894,5670340,"Natural wine from a big traditional producer. And a good one - good acidity, tropical fruits and slightly macerated grapefruit, pomelo and its zest"
8895,5670340,"Pure! Mousse. First taste high acidity. Nose “ like in the cave’. Apple, unripe fruit, salty. Wait until hot summer lunch with seafood platter! "
8896,16963,"Pale gold. Complex aromas of toast, vanilla, melon, oak and apple. Great minerality, with high acidity and medium body, with a persistent finnish with flavors of pecan and brioche. Very interesting wine, showing complexity with freshness. 4.3-4.4"
8897,16963,Dry medium body slightly higher acidity. Flavors of green apple pear melon citrus honey nutty and minerality of stone.  Nicely done 
8898,16963,"Oak and butter, fresh nose or pineapple and flint. Passion fruit, dry and elegant, crisp and stylish. Medium length, lively. Excellent. "
8899,16963,"This is the reserva field blend white, not sure if this is the same bottle. A well balanced white, good minerality, melon and limes, slight vanilla and oak. Got 2 bottles at winery."
8900,16963,"Clear, pale lemon. Clean, medium intensity aroma of mango, peach, pineapple, oak, wet stone. Dry, medium plus acidity, medium body and medium plus finish. Creamy mouth feel. "
8901,16963,"I haven’t had much Portuguese wine in my days but this is one of the most interesting yet.  Scent: Smoke, barnyard, vanilla, rubber, oak, old oysters shells, seashells and yellow plum.  Looks: Clear yellow.  Mouthfeel: Dry. ABV is 12,5%. Medium acidity. Bit too low, which brings it down a bit. Medium bodied.  Grape varieties: 60% Gouveio, 24% Arinto and 16% Rabigato. Fermentation takes place in French 500 litre oak casks. 33% new oak. Maturation in oak for seven months.  (3,9)"
8902,16963,I really enjoyed this wine. It was interesting and different given the nutty and aromatic nose.  Well made and subtle this is a wine to savour.
8903,16963,"[Quinta do Vallado Winery Visit 1/5] Big, professional house, informative tour. The visit was finally dominated by that 131 year old port in the end but the rest was rather enjoyable too 😊. Again the Portuguese show that they know very well how to do oaked whites: measured & constructive. 6 months in the barrel cause subtle oak in the mineralic nose joined by lemon & other citrus and some tropical fruit. The oily palate is very crisp with abricot, lime, gentle grapefruit & measured toast in the finish. 3.9"
8904,16963,"Serious wine 🥂 plenty of citrus notes, and nice acidity- blending of Gouveio, Arinto and Rabigato "
8905,16963,"Pineapple, mango, lychee, melon, and pear nose. High acidity. Full body. Vanilla, banana fosters, pineapple, and melon. 3.9⭐️ creamy and complex.   Age up to 8 years. "
8906,16963,"Smells of straw, mineral, and apple. High acidity, medium body. Good balance of citrus and stone fruit with high minerality. "
8907,16963,"Full bodied, rich wine shows deep golden colour and an array of flavours; green apple, honey, caramel, passion fruit, dried apricot, walnut, bright acidity and long persistent finish. 4"
8908,16963,"Good complexity and minerality. Not extraordinary, but good quality wine"
8909,16963,"Pale in color with just a touch of yellow and green hues. Aged 7 months in French oak. Green apple, lemon, lime, vanilla, and oak on the nose. Touch of cream. Medium plus acidity, lemon and citrus body with just a touch of stone and tropical fruit. Balance with oak and cream on the finish. 3.8 stars "
8910,16963,"Complex gentle aromas of stone fruits with earthy mineral notes and slight floral undertones of this 4 grape blend. The palate revealed a well-balanced wine with good acidity with refined and integrated oak. Flavors of citrus and dried fruits along with spicy notes came forth in this full-bodied white wine. The wine concluded with a long crisp and fresh finish. Very enjoyable! I read about 50 cases of the 2012 vintage were exported to the US, I don’t believe any of the 2013 made it over."
8911,2045239,"Needs decanting, air. Subtle nose once it opens up,  black fruit,  oak. Dark ruby coloque despite 11 years, thick and concentrated aroma. Well balanced plum, vanilla and oak in the mouth, the tannins are now mellowed but the acidity still makes it a great food companion . Superb finish"
8912,2045239,"A very different red!  Aromas of blackberry, chocolate, oak & pencil lead!  Medium body, balanced acidity, enough tannins!  Taste of tobacco and central Portugal minerals in the mouth!  Big wine yiamas!!! "
8913,2045239,"Looking back at 2018 Ervideira is one of my favorite discoveries  Their tinto riserva is strong and complex, their Branco is amazing and this one is out of this world "
8914,2045239,"94/100....oak, plum, dark cherry, tobacco, ash and leather. Amazing with some terciary notes. Violet and brown color. 13.5%. Amazing this discovery. Paired with cod in the oven over ceramic tail. Cheers "
8915,2045239,Needs to breath. Goes from a tannic full bodied punch in the face to a velvety silky smooth ripe dark fruit taste bomb. Still one of the best portugese i have tasted
8916,2045239,"That's the right bottle to round up the first weekend evening. Very good Portuguese blend of Aragonez, AB and Trincadeira. Alentejo terroir seems to serve all these three grapes. AB from France, Aragonez from Spain and Trincadeira local Portuguese grape. Full bodied with deep dense color. On the nose there is the work of Trincadeira with aromas of blackberries and herbs. Completed by influence of Aragonez with red berries. AB gives to all these jamminesse. The best of these 3 grapes combined to perfect wine"
8917,2045239,"Amazing wine. Drank 13 y after its harvest, its close to being a perfect wine.Smooth, good blend of wood and primary flavours. The best you can get from Alentejo."
8918,2045239,"Dark purple color, smells of black plum, clove, anise, raspberry, and cranberry, full body with nice acidity and very firm tannin, this can easily last 8-10 years, tastes of prune, Asian spice, dark chocolate and espresso bean, long velvety finish, very nice QPR!"
8919,2045239,"Full, intense, herby nose with a spicy, slightly tarry edge. Very appealing. Good concentration on the palate. Intense, herby edged tarry berry fruit. Nicely savoury with some good structure. "
8920,2045239,"Green strawberry, minerals and forest floor. Nice find!"
8921,2045239,A very elegant and bold red! Huge travesty that these Portuguese wines are not being exported to the US! This blend is superb and most complex but with a very smoothe finish. 
8922,2045239,"Just a pleasure. Cherries royale, cardamon, licorice, granite, pencil lead, and a subtle fruity sweetness that balances the soft tannins very well. Smooth as velvet. The same sumptuous mouthfeel too. Beautiful legs, good finish, bold nose of dates and chocolate. Difficult to see where it can be improved. Cellarable for years. Awesome."
8923,2045239,"After an initial debacle with the cork obliterating upon opening it was definitely worth the struggle. Decanted for 2hrs and enjoyed what is a lovely wine. 19yrs old at the time of drinking, good structure with fine tannins on the finish. Can really taste the depth and age you'd expect from a 2002 bottle. Portuguese wines constantly impress me and what you generally get for your money makes them even more worth investing in. "
8924,2045239,"Lovely. An estate I didn’t know but did drive past once! This is a great wine. Naturally sweet but within bounds, red and black fruit and some well judged oak and tannin that doesn’t jar. High quality and delicious "
8925,2045239,"Blackberry, dark chocolate, dried herbs, rosemary and clove. Medium acidity and tannins. Beautiful complex wine. "
8926,4442606,Still not my thing despite all of them nice triggers.
8927,4442606,"Notes of minerals, green apple, almond and citrus. 3 ⭐️ "
8928,4442606,"Capela Incomum wine bar. I've never had a wine from Beira Interior before. So always great to have a first. Smoky nose, citrus, quite Chablis like nose. Very high acid, really refreshing. Apple , lime, really lovely. This has mixed reviews on Vivino but I'm loving it. Deffo one to chill right down. Yum ! "

8930,4442606,"Like drinking a Stone, amazing minerality cut with lemon, green apple skin and malic acid."
8931,4442606,"Rich, slightly woody/smoky red blend, very enjoyable with interesting notes standing out"
8932,6418009,Happy WWW.  In Lisbon better try their signature white 🍇.  This is Arinto from Alentejo though.  Still south 🇵🇹  The grape using 30%French oak plus on Lees 6 months to add some creaminess to the texture.  Solid mineral acidity flavours in the passionfruit and apricot. Quite a lovely balance and so refreshing.  Oak also brings a little baking spices  Paired with tuna carpaccio while I await my oven roasted octopus 🐙  Solid 4 ⭐️.   So many 🍇 here 🇵🇹 .  So little time.  I gotta pick up the pace 😉
8933,6418009,Lekker man! Thanks @[1|46619914|Timetowine.nl]!
8934,6418009,"Very nice. Reminds me a bit of Gavalas’ Assyrthiko Natural ferment because of the almond cream. 4,5 because it also has a warm baked apple feel. "

8942,6418009,Lemon and minerals. Medium bodied. Great with fish
8943,6418009,"A refreshing mid weight white from Alentejo.   Nose of lemon, mandarin, canned apricots and crushed rocks. The palate shows nice acidity with the French oak flavours emerging in the mid palate. Mis week joy. +6.5/10"
8944,6418009,A tad warm in colour and on the dry side. A bit shy on flavours but I really can’t complain. 
8945,6418009,Levemente evoluído mas com a acidez do arinto... 
8946,6418009,"13% abv, médium intensity gold colour, aromas of ripe lemon, tangerin and apricot. Dry, medium - body, medium acidity. Short finish. "

8950,1319400,Excelente custo beneficio 
8951,1319400,"Spicy and intense, brilliant Douro wine"
8952,1319400,Too acidic and citric!
8953,1319400,"Uau, this was great and really need to add it in the cellar"
8954,1319400,With Sue & Deb in Porto - La Racatta
8955,1319400,Excellent value for the money!
8956,1319400,"Intense, complex, great end tasting  @vivivo there’s a white and red version of the same wine, please fix the categorization"
8957,1319400,Pretty decent powerful red for £3 Although I don't think vivino have matched the name correctly
8958,1319400,Great wine - fantastic with beef
8959,1319400,Light. Easy drinking. Great Value. 
8960,1319400,"Deep ruby color with few shades of purple rims. Pronounced aromas of blackberries, violet and raisins with touch of coffee, tobacco and cigar box. Pleasant acidity, balanced and silky tannins. Long finish "
8961,1319400,"Last bottle left. Sweet cherry and berry nose. Very sweet fruit, plums, sweet cherries, sweet plums. Long and powerful, very well balanced. Smooth tannins. Perfect with bacalao, Norwegian style."
8962,76031,Average wine from the Dao region but great value for money.

8966,76031,"The second time I drink it, after 3 months, it seems better. Deep red color, full body, red and black fruits, a bit sweet on the palate, strong aftertaste. It gave good fit with the fish dinner. "
8967,76031,This was a real surprise!  I picked it up because it was cheap and I needed to make up enough to get the discount from the wine store. Smooth with lots of mellow fruit. Good body and woody notes. I’ve tasted much worse for twice the price. 
8968,76031,"This Red wine opens with a nose of Strawberry licorice and Floral. It is dry with soft tannins and vanilla spice. Flavors of Strawberry, Dark Cherry, Raspberry, Oak and Vanilla. Nice value wine. Have a Great Sunday and Cheers to all my wine friends. 🍷🍷🍷"
8969,76031,The scent of walking through a warm and dark forest which matches in a funny way with the black forest cake smooth cherry flavour. Rounded tannins and a sweet aftertaste. A pleasant surprise for as low of a price as wines get where I live.
8970,76031,"The Portuguese evening went well and I enjoyed the pickled octopus followed by peri peri prawns. Vasco red was introduced, as the rest of the group had spicy offal on couscous with beans. I was pleasantly surprised in this dark smooth peppery and cherry taste in a  blend of Portuguese reds. Easy tannins and a distant musty and leathery hint. Value for money, and I will try again."
8971,76031,"Surprised, having in mind the price of the bottle.  👃 very fresh, expected of a young wine, floral, with pepper, cherry and vanilla notes.  🍷 smooth like silk, well balanced, medium acidity and good tannins. Perfect for the Christmas and New Year’s Eve. "
8972,76031,"3,6⭐A classic Red from Dão. 30 to 60 min of aeration did it good. 🍇T. Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro. 👀Dark garnet. Scarse and blurry tears. 👃Intense on the red fruit, mainly cherry. But also some plum, licorice and pepper. 👅Balanced, medium body, dry. Smooth given the low tannins and medium acidity. Medium finish with the spices in the aftertaste. 🗒️Well made with an ok complexity and definitely gastronomic. Good PQR, gets the job done well considering the price (~3€)."
8973,76031,"Iberuly🇪🇸🇵🇹#5 and this fruity Dao red was the bottle that took me thru Sunday’s second half, ET and penalty shoot out. Like England by that stage it was OK but not great. A blend of traditional local Portuguese grapes Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Alfrocheiro, it’s a mid week quaffing kinda wine. Medium bodied, medium tannin, fresh and quite acidic with fruit flavours of cherry & blackberry. Finished it off, consoling ourselves with post match late night bacon sandwiches. 3.5⭐️ Congrats to the Azzurri 🇮🇹 👏👏"
8974,76031,"Nice medium body, dry with hints of maple, raspberry, chocolate and slight licorice on palate. Smooth finish. Really enjoying Portuguese offerings of late."
8975,76031,"A decent drinkable wine... fruity, not very complex, but better than barely drinkable, if I had to drink another bottle slowly I wouldn't feel too bad about it. "
8976,76031,"Limited tasting notes. From what I remember, this was dry and fruit forward, with green pepper notes. Well worth the price! "
8977,1247933,"Very fruity in the aroma, with good depth, wood, balsamic and with vegetal notes. Intense taste in the mouth, spicy tannin, tasty and with extraction, is a robust red and to last."
8978,1247933,"4⭐️ for this Portuguese Beira Interior 🇵🇹 red wine. 👁 Clear visual with a garnet color.👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry with red fruits and a second sniff focused on strawberry and oak. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of red fruits. Good persistence in the mouth with medium finish. Elegance red wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🍷"
8979,1247933,"Fresh, nearly crisp and flowery Touriga National from the mountains of Central Portugal. Fruity and savory notes of bergamot, rosemary and pine tar. "
8980,1247933,"Nice red from Beira region, slightly acidic though well balanced with tannin soft notes. "
8981,1247933,"Apparently this wine will improve with age but I thought it was great already. Maybe with age it will become slightly more complex and slightly less fruity, but it is already a deep flavoured wine."
8982,1247933,Amazing value for money
8983,1247933,Soft tannins and lots of berries
8984,1247933,Good with steak. Tanins and dark fruits.
8985,1247933,"On the bottom of Portugal's highest mountain, Serra da Estrela, these wines get  their elegant acidity and moderate bodies,  nice ruby colour, red  and dark fruit aromas, some  smokiness and a hint of greenish vegetables...  Nice value for a great wine,  from a region to discover..."
8986,1247933,A vivid violet Portuguese wine with a leathery nose with some cocoa. Round palate and flavour rich with the tannins present but not aggressive.
8987,1247933,"This nice 2007 northern red,"
8988,1247933,Touriga Nacional wine with a fresh profile and typical floral aromas of the variety. From a region of highlands and an high amplitude of temperature during the year.
8989,1247933,"Delicious Bairrada, extreme, we were curiously surprised when we found out what grape variety it is made of!"
8990,7328070,"Sampled at the excellent ‘Wines of Portugal’, Lisbon. If you want intense, concentrated but soft, sweet, silky smooth red and dark fruit then look no further. Nice dry finish although a bit short and lacks complexity for a 5. Super enjoyable nevertheless and sneaks a 4.5."
8991,7328070,Elegant as it gets. Pure Touriga Nacional delight. Perfect tannins and joyful ending. Will revisit...soon! 93/100 Cheers! #wine #redwine #wineoclock🍷 #winelover #winetasting #winetime #portugalwine #daowines @cabrizwines

9000,67584,Good surprise. Light yellow. Pineapple on the nose. A good balance of vanilla amd fruits jam. Somewhat long aftertaste.
9001,67584,"I love Alentajo wines, but sadly this is not one of them. Quite bold & fry with a rough taste of dark fruit."
9002,67584,"Different grapes: Aragonez, trincadeira, Alicante Bouschet, tastes a bit like Carmenere. I like Tinta Roriz and Tourigal Nacional better."
9003,67584,"Dry, hard to drink"
9004,67584,"Basic wine, very fruity with plum basically. Not complex. High acidity and tannins. Basic wine. End super short, full bodied and very dry."
9005,67584,"Despite the cheap price this one is surprisingly good! Plum and blackcurrant, lively red cherries. Happy Sunday sipping!"
9006,67584,"Rich and ripe, this red displays concentrated flavors of dark cherry, boysenberry and plum tart, loaded with cardamom and dried ginger notes. Ends with a creamy finish.  "
9007,67584,"Good value for money talking about an entry level for a day by day wine. Fruity, balanced 14% alcohool, smooth tannins. Not concentrated but It is expected at this price range. "
9008,67584,Ok wine to pair an airplane dinner (TAP flight). Some plum notes and a good body. 3.4
9009,67584,"Belo Portuga, easy drinking total!!!"
9010,67584,"Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet. Typical blend from Portugal for pairing with local dishes. Medi bodied and young, this wine doesn’t deliver complexity but it reminds me of a typical Portuguese table wine for everyday meal. Despite of the absence of touriga, those three grapes are very popular. Cherry and cranberry with a touch of minerals and medium acidity, short finish and simple. Very accessible in price. Cheers! "
9011,67584,I think this is the last bottle. Ederlezi is playing...fuck. Life is beautiful.
9012,67584,Um blend português com nuances de groselha e chocolate... intenso!

9029,67584,Can't understand lower ratings tastes sublime
9030,6746011,"Strangely this one has a dark tone compared to the others.  A intense and spicy aroma. In terms of taste, also strong, a spicy hint, bitter with a present after taste. In general, well structured. "
9031,6746011,"Great red from Dão!  A concentrated and fresh blend of Touriga Nacional, Alfrocheiro, Jean e Baga, from higher altitude vines and granitic soils. Bold, deep and complex, with juicy acidity and great length.  Deep purple color, floral, ripe dark fruits aromas/flavors, slightly herbaceous, with notes of mint, spices, cedar and well integrated oak. Full body, polished tannins and a long tasty finish. Good value and already drinking well!"
9032,6746011," Deep purple red color with violet rim reflections. Notes of ripe black fruit, blueberry, blackberry, black currant, black cherry, vanilla tobacco leaves, cigar box and spices. Well structured with firm tannins, full bodied, balanced, good acidity and long seductive finish. Great wine !!!"
9033,6746011,"Portugal tasting red #11.  At last we go a bit higher in quality. Richer in flavours like black fruit, herbs, graphite, black cherries, sour cherries on alcohol. A wine with much body, noble tannins and a good acidity but also ending with a whiff of alcohol."
9034,6746011,"Deep dark in the glas. A fine mix of vanilla, mint and a touch of chocolate in the nose. Inviting! On the palate you realize that this wine is driven by a lot of oak.. and yet it doesn’t feel overpowering. Besides the same aromas as in the nose, there is some eucalyptus and almond added on the palate. Dense in flavor and with quiet the power. Long lasting after the finish. A slight bitter touch settles on the palate aswell.. in this case the character giving kind of bitterness. Still with lots of potential!"
9035,6746011,Fruity and floral with lovely tanning and a stable but relevant spice taste. The noise great mixing fresh red fruit and cardamom spice. It has a nice finishing in the mouth.
9036,6746011,"Subtle fruit, leather, smooth tannins and medium body. This is a lovely wine. "
9037,6746011,Really smooth and flavorful 
9038,6746011,"3.9. Acidity was a bit high. But loved the dry, robust body. "
9039,6746011,"👍 ES92 RP93 WS90 AD93. Blend of 60% Touriga Nacional, 25% Alfrocheiro & 15% Jaén (aka Mencía in Spain). From Moreira, Olzabal & Borges (M.O.B.) winery. Velvety tannins. 40yo vines. From Dão, Portugal. 14% alcohol. 700 cases made. Clube Adega Black 10/2020 Adega Alentejana. Early 2019-35. Saúde a todos 🍷🇵🇹"
9040,6746011,"Nice and agreeable. Had it with Chinese hot pot and it was good. Dark fruits on nose and palate, and prunes. "
9041,6746011,"Nice Douro blend. Flavors of black currant, vanilla well balance acidity. Very enjoyable! Paired it with a tenderloin from the grill and chimichurri. Great combination for a great evening. Only can recommend this Vinha Senna M.O.B. "
9042,6746011,"Cedar, earth, tobacco. Not bad, a bit shallow on the follow through "
9043,6746011,Plum and leather dominate
9044,6746011,Boldish dry red with dark fruit flavors and a hint of amaretto like notes. 
9045,76108,"beatiful nose on fermentation aromas. toasted bread, yeast. high acidity and long finish.very elegant"
9046,76108,"My first Portuguese sparkling! Made from Touriga Nacional and a bit of Encruzado. This 2007 rosé from Dão uses grapes known for port, so it was great to see how they taste in non-fortified form. Although this was initially closed+shallow, the air allowed the oxidative qualities to come out nicely.  Nose: light green apple floral whiff, overtaken by strong banana. Slight yeast.  Palate: low dosage. Apple compôte with bitter skin. nutty+banana oxidative notes+apriot kick in to give depth. Nice acidic finish."
9047,76108,I wouldn't keep it for a long time!...
9048,76108,Very good!!! Hidden gem and really enjoy the flavor and strong but smooth at the same time... just give it time  
9049,76108,"Excellent. Dry, interesting evolution. Pleasant bubble. Tomatoes, carrot, red pepper."
9050,6762706,"Turned out to be a nice choice in the chaos of food, wines, noises. Blackberries, blackcurrant, blueberries, black ripe cherries, leather, cedar, smoke and baking spices. "
9051,6762706,"Lovely wine from the Beira region of northern Portugal (that includes the well-known Dao sub-region), this features single grape Alfrocheiro Preto and is very approachable: attractive medium ruby (yet clear) in the glass; masses of dark fruit, blackcurrant, blackberry and cherry, dry and smooth."
9052,6762706,"Clear ruby, lots of blackberry, blueberry, plum, dark chocolate, elegant, very approachable, easy drinking afrocheiro, subtle smokiness, medium acidity, very smooth tannins "
9053,6762706,"A solid 4*!! Strong aroma, smooth, really well balanced. Like honey :) "
9054,6762706,"Delicious wine. Full body, decently dry. In the finish some dark fruit with a hint of spice. "
9055,6762706,Big oak my smokey bottle. Nice enough.
9056,6762706,"Strawberry, oak, orange rind"
9057,6762706,Was very good with salmon and black rice and grilled tomatoes. Deep balanced round taste. 
9058,6762706,"Fruit and rich, a great taste of Lisbon"
9059,6762706,"With body, balanced and with a very well integrated wood. Very good "
9060,6762706,This one I liked much more than the Douro. It’s elegant and dancing on the palate with good red fruits and acidity
9061,6762706,Fantastic red from Dao region.  Lovely notes of forest fruits and oak at the end. Nice texture and well-balanced. 
9062,1678536,"Recommended by Jorge - this was yummy, dark fruit, bold "
9063,1678536,Lovely smooth red ... drunk in Northern Portugal 
9064,1678536,"Smells of tobacco, oak and chocolate  Tastes of chocolate and black fruit. Bold, Off dry and medium acidity"
9065,1678536,"Fairly light, sort of a bright red fruit, jammy nose. A somewhat interesting taste combination of acidic red fruit like Rainier cherries, and moderate dryness, but not tannic - more like a light dusty finishing flavor. Smooth and drying finish. Somehow, perhaps more appealing than the above sounds, and worked well with sardine avocado toast."
9066,1678536,Medium purple density. On the nose there is a strong floral potpourri. This red is bright and feminine. On the palate its balanced though the grippy tannins love a steak. At it’s price point it presents an excellent QPR.  Part of Tras-os-Montes flight and paired with a steak. First Northern Portugal Red on Vivino for me.
9067,1678536,"This is the area north of Douro bordering Spain, made with 30% Tinta Amarela, 30% Tinta Roriz and remaining 40% unidentified, this is surprisingly common in Portugal where in the old days they just lay the vines down without identifying them, you could have a field with up to 40+ varietals, deep burgundy color, nose smells of leather, dried orange peel, clove, nutmeg, graphite, charcoal, cacao, black cherry & blackberry, full body with nice acidity and firm tannin, tastes mimic the nose, quite ripe finish."
9068,1678536,Dry and tart. Very clean with nice spice notes very red fruit and tart berries. 
9069,1678536,"Very nice red wine with notes of cherry, oak, tobacco, plum and dark chocolate. 3,5⭐️"
9070,1678536,Best one from Tras os Montes so far. Still preferring the Vinho Verde
9071,1678536,"Great value. Initially has a light approach, but quickly shows off its caracther made of a very stony, granitic, profile with deliciously integrated fruit, very mineral always very elegant and impressively drinkable. For a 5yo wine this is quite impressive given that it is the entry level wine of a three tier project. Amazing value"
9072,1678536,"Nice, dry, smooth fruity"
9073,1678536,"Bold taste, quite tannic. Needs good airing. "

9077,7889010,"wow. special, intense, not very fruity, delicious"
9078,1972962,"Very toasty, with smoky spice notes.  Dark golden yellow, would be great with robust or spicy meats.  Incredibly different white."
9079,1972962,Wow top Portugiese

9082,1972962,Em prova no Bye Bye Summer Wine Party @ Marriott Lisboa.
9083,1972962,"(Surprisingly,) soooo elegant now. Hearty & masculine 4 or 5 years ago. Complex & lovely now. 40%AB/20%PV/20%TN/20%A. With air, a 5.0-woof bouquet. Superfine leather & Heath-bar toffee. Melded Alentejo fruits. Petriclor. Iodine. A peacock’s tail. Ethereal. Sweet elderberry fruit. Best at cellar temp. Had it years ago at Servas’ nice Estremoz restaurant, but none available for purchase. Found 3 in Lisbon. 4.2 to 4.3 woofs now. Another great 2011. Almost too elegant for our lamb loin chops. Special stuff."
9084,1972962,Nice smooth wine blackberry on the palate 
9085,1972962,"A few years on the bottle has taken this this wine in the right direction. A lot smoother then it was almost 5 years ago but still some tannins and roughness left. Full bodied, complex with black berries, tobacco, wood and a spicy long taste. A personal favorite. "
9086,1972962,"  I was fortunate enough to be given this wine by a Portuguese friend. Thank Ollie.   A sabor intense wine as suggested however to me, it deserves a little more time in the bottle as the tannins might suggest, other reviewers missed the opportunity.  I enjoyed the wine with a rich meat pie, a great pairing.   "

9089,1972962,"Fruity, complex and very pleasant aromas. Black berries, plums and other sweet fruit suggesting jam. Long and balanced taste with some sweetness, also due to high alcohol content."
9090,1972962,Sweet and low down.
9091,1972962,"Double positive surprise when I stepped in this authentic, local restaurant near the natural salt mines of Rio Maior in Portugal. Delicious food and a very impressive wine menu with a wealth of older wines from across Portugal... The cellar is the fruit of decades of wine passion!  This 14 year old Alentejano was ready to be paired with a succulent piece of prime beef grilled on a hot stone in front of you!  At first the rich, perfume nose with prune, plum and moist sousbois lures you in... ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️"

9111,1105378,"Very fresh, aromatic. Nice with seafood. "
9112,1105378,"Good, fresh and fruity. Tones of vanilla, chocolate and cherries. A little on the sweet side compared to other Alentejo whites."

9121,1105378,"Paolo likes this, I haven’t tried"
9122,1105378,"Revisiting a second bottle, and wishing I bought more. An absolutely bargain for under a tenner. Creamy stone fruit with hints of subdued tropical fruit. Guava? Broad palate.  Medium bodied. High acidity. Balanced.  When chilled, the complexity is more apparent with minerality and herbal thyme notes. Perhaps even light wax.   "
9123,5988966,This a velvety and delicious amphora wine. The clay has really rounded the often sharp tannins of this region. At bistro 100 Maneiras.
9124,5988966,"85 pts; dark ruby with rustic flavours of earth, pine needles; this is another amphora wine from Rocim; it’s not bad but at 37 euros at the winery, the QPR just won’t cut it. Not recommended."
9125,5988966,Nice and smooth. Lots of dark fruits.
9126,5988966,"90/100 Blend of Trincadeira, Alicante Bouschet, Petite Verdot, and Tannat. Foot trodden red aged in clay pots for 16 months. Notes of red raspberry, mulberry, pepper, violets, and charred earth. Dense and structured, this has character but needs time to settle down in the bottle. It's really closed right now. Big boy wine. "
9127,5988966,"Earthy,  black fruit, clay pot, plum"
9128,5988966,if you like Olho de Mocho this a must buy. Enjoy this delicious blend. I can feel a Roman tradition in this clay driven aftertaste. Delicious. Bottle 1665. Saúde!!

9147,2374113,Nice velvety chocolate -- firm tannins on finish but balanced. Short lasting on finish... Dark ripe berries. 
9148,2374113,Fruitful and flora on nose. A concentrated medium body wine with bit tight tanning.
9149,2374113,Very bad edition of Touriga Nacional. 
9150,2374113,Nice medium body original Douro wine
9151,2374113,Lots of raspberry with some blueberry and plum. Tiniest bit of spice and smoke. Medium bodied with a short finish. Lacking complexity. Not a wine I would have again as it's just not my style. Slightly disappointing.
9152,1153139,"3.5-4.0. Nice, light one. Aroma: citrus, green apple. Tadte: citrus, green apple, grapefruit."
9153,1153139,"Light, easy drinking Vihno Verde!  Passion fruit, apple and lemon on the nose. Peach, more citrus and apple on the palate. Medium finish. Good."
9154,1153139,"For the price, not bad at all! Pineapple and apple on the nose. On the palate, citrus and more apple. Quite acidic, it packs a punch for a vinho verde. Good with indian food. "

9157,1153139,Fresh. Just only fresh.

Straw yellow with green reflections in colour, on the nose, aromas of citrus and pear with notes of spices. Light tannins. High acidity. Green and flinty white wine in style.

It has long a finish."
9160,1153139,Citrus and slightly salty crisp fresh dry white with light floral and tropical notes. Lovely with shellfish.

9162,1153139,Light and refreshing - definite floral tones. Slightly spicy finish. Nice yellow color.
9163,1153139,"Curiously it’s only rated as 2% as match for me, but one of my favourite white style. Perfect acidity, but not very fruity. On the nose citrus notes. On palate, lemon notes. Short finish."
9164,1153139,An unbelievably refreshing dry white. Highly recommend in hot conditions but also when you’re thirsty. Or just want a drink! Top notch 
9165,1153139,First experience with Vinho Verde.  Took few sips to get accustomed.  Mixed fire longs at first but it grows on you.  This one I found acidic and strong at first but mellows out.  
9166,1153139,Refreshing and light wine. A little bit acidic. Good option for summer hot days. Notes of citrus and apple. 
9167,5277662,"Really exemplary, with a rich yet dry and light mouthfeel and light pink rose color. Notes of and strawberry, sour cherry, cantaloupe, lime, and even a hint of leather."
9168,5277662,"3.6.  Super value Rose from Portugal’s Dao region. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Afrocheiro. Light pressing gives the wine one of the deepest pink colors I’ve seen. Rose petal on the nose and a refreshingly low 12.5% alcohol   Light bodied with a citrus fruit expression. Crisp acidity gives the wine some bit to a really east drinking wine   On the palate it’s strawberry, lemon peel, grapefruit and a touch of saline on the finish  86pts"
9169,5277662,Delightful in the sun really strong strawberry notes with a nice sour grapefruit burst to finish 
9170,5277662,"An absolute wordly rose wine. Not usually one for an overly fruity rose buy the strawberry notes definitely compliment this very easy drinking rose, still with a touch of dry notes which is what I generally look for in  a rose. I would imagine its best to drink whilst the sun is going down, all the heat with a blue sky, either at home or abroad!"
9171,5277662,"Attractive link color, fruity aroma and taste with a crispy end. Excellent for fish dishes and white meats of Mediterranean, Chinese , Indian and African cuisine"
9172,5277662,"Very nice light rose wine.  Get a lot of strawberry on the nose and the palate, but very refreshing.  Finishes light but with flavour.  Went really well as an after dinner wine."
9173,5277662,"I really like this, bone dry and not too sweet - the Rosé characteristics are not too pronounced, it's predominantly lemon, grapefruit, stone and a little white peach but with just enough strawberry and cranberry in the finish. Paired it with sea trout salad and it was perfect."
9174,5277662,"Great value, easy drinking, lots of aromatics of citrus, sour cherry, grapefruit.  Crisp and refreshing on the pallet, a little bit of bitterness to finish"
9175,5277662,"👌🏻😎 Enjoyable, dry + light Rosé. Not particularly acidic. Minerality and floral nose. Peachy fruity kick upfront short dry finish."

9181,5277662,"A nice dry rose, peachy in color. Tastes of green apple,strawberry and minerals. Yummy, crisp and refreshing. "
9182,2774081,Profound wine with great depth and intensity  The wine has a great perfumed nose of fruits and baked spices; rich and concentrated on the palate; round and smooth with accurate flavours of black cherries and dried plums  Long persistent length
9183,2774081,"Layered aroma to berries and flowers, as well as spices - some vanilla and licorice. Rich taste, that seems to never end. Black berries, licorice, clove, black pepper. Firm tannins, M acidity."
9184,2774081,"CARAVELA RESTAURANNT BH. 4.3 Deep ruby red colour, agrreable aromas, red & black berries, sweet spices, dark chocolate, vanilla, integrated oak, young, but balanced, polite tannins, long finish.

PAIRING:  Pork cheek   CARAVELA BH 4.3 Rubi profundo, agradável aroma frutas mistas, especiarias doces, baunilha, chocolate amargo, madeira integrada, jovem mas equilíbrado, taninos macios, final longo. 2010 foi melhor, mas este foi ótimo também. PAR: Bochecha de porco."
9185,2774081,"The first glass I drink just remind me a word ... Fabulous The last I drink a wine like this was Quinta do Mouro It has body, caracter and an fantastic finish   "
9186,2774081,"Full-bodied wine, dark red, ruby colour. Nose is woody, smokey and spicey. Underlying herbs as well, but not neccessarily mint only (as the label declares). Grapes are foot-pressed in old marble pools (I've been in the cellar and saw it), so one can taste pressers' sweat (I'm kidding, of course). Palate: red berries, dominant is raspberry. It's an interesting sensation that just before you taste the berries, you can briefly taste some bitter-spicey sensation (liquorice). Lovely, long finish. Great, Julio !"
9187,2774081,Fruity and sweet
9188,2774081,Well structured & complex wine. Highly recommended 👍🏻👌🏻
9189,2774081,"Juicy with a bitter end from the petit verdot. Open it for a couple of hours before drinking, it definitely needs to ""open/breath"" before serving"
9190,2774081,"One of the best wines from Alentejo, great palet soft tantines and high quality brining red fruits and very long aftertaste. Can be enjoyed immediately but if you have 5 years patience, you will enjoy one of the best wines you have ever tasted..."
9191,2774081,"As usual, deep nose, black fruits and spices. Med to full, silky and juicy, extra sweetness surrounded by smooth tannins. A great pp ratio. Long lasting "
9192,2774081,"Dark colors, full bodied, fruity and spicey  An a nice finish."
9193,2774081,With friends at home 
9194,2774081,"Classically annoying, loud, in your face American red. Except from Portugal. At 1/3 the cost. Fruit forward, Welch’s Grape Jelly-goodness. Wonderful. Bam. "
9195,2774081,"Great Alentejo! Black berry jam. Minty, leafy and smoked liked a BBQ. It even gives a bit of a bretty funk after a while. Earth tones, riped black fruit and dark bitter chochlate on the palate. Elegant. Complex. Feels silky smooth on exit."
9196,2774081,"Great example of one of the best Alentejo red grande reserva, made from old vines fermented in ancient marble Lagares. Dark Ruby very rich red fruits, slight scent of spices. Very intense and rich with long and great aftertaste. My favourite Portuguese!"
9197,5047652,"One of my favourite white wine variety: Encruzado. Pale colour, with a nice citric notes. One of the main aspects of this wine variety is the unctuous caracteristic while tasting. Very present in this wine."
9198,5047652,Dark yellow. Citric on the nose. Dry and mineral. Long finish. Great Encruzado! 
9199,5047652,"A nice encruzado distinct from the standard aproach since it involves no wood maturation. Nice color, nice smell. With no wood it is somewhat hard the first contact but it feels in the end very pleasent. A prolonged taste without the typical notes of butter and vanilla of the wood matured encruzados. Nice to try indeed."
9200,5047652,"Unoaked encruzado, smooth, unctuous with some bitterness. Notes of citrus and minerals."
9201,4849111,"Very nice 100% trincadeira from alentejo (a first ) in Portugal, even if it is a touch too dry for me. Medium bodied and smooth , blackberries, cherries, touch of spice, leather, smoke and forest floor and a pretty decent long finish. "
9202,4849111,Very good dry red wine. Helps being in Evora Portugal for the ambiance.. good deep color with decent legs. Violets and pepper on the nose. Dry but balanced wine. Good with pork cheeks marinated in port. 
9203,4849111,"Another good one from Portugal, very balanced "
9204,4849111,"Nice bold wine with deep ruby color. Red fruit, strawberry, raspberry, oak, vanilla, leather. Good tannins and good acidity, a bit dry finish. Medium to full body. It can age well in bottle for some years. "
9205,4849111,Notes of red berries. Soft velvety wine
9206,4849111,"soft red color. floral aroma. In the mouth it is very mineral, with soft tannins. Long finish. Very seductive wine"

9208,4849111,Denise loved it
9209,4849111,Excentric taste. Lots of peculiar herbal flavors and a wonderful persistent finish. Great wine.

9211,1712635,Bolha fina e final intenso tavora
9212,1712635,"This is a ridiculously cheap fizz for the quality it has. Lots of bubbles, clean citrus overtones but it is on the sweet side. Very light nose. But this is truly pleasing and great as an aperitif."
9213,1712635,Cava-esque. Apple = stewed Bramley Heartburn rating = 4/5
9214,1712635, green apple apple citrus
9215,1712635,Richness and depth of something like a sherry (- but definitely not a sherry). One to explore further when visiting in-land Douro. 
9216,1712635,"I love bubbles!  This one is great, despite the fact that one of the locals in Portugal told me not to drink sparkling wine in Portugal hehe It reminds of classical champagne (don’t throw rocks at me, ok?)"
9217,1712635,Very nice espumante.
9218,1712635,Second time I had some Portugese bubbles. This one's real nice and tight dry.
9219,1712635,"A catch-up note from my recent Portugal holiday. I very much enjoyed the sparkling wines and the Murganheira wines I tried were excellent. Pale lemon. Cooking apple with raisin, brioche, alike apple strudel. Fresh citrus (clementine & lime), white flowers. Med. aroma intensity. Dry, med. acidity, lovely spritzy elderflower & citrus (lemon, lime & again, clementine). Dried orange peel. Slight biscuity/yeasty character with gooseberry fool creaminess through the expansive med.+ finish. Very good."
9220,1712635,"Great value. Nicely dry, crisp, no fuss. Not a very refined sparkling but Correct and drinking very well. Between 3 and 3,5 but gets the higher score for its value!"
9221,1712635,"Wonderful spumante, best bubbles I have ever had from Portugal, great balance, pleasant acidity, dry, crispy and refreshing. Suits for pairing for seafood or as an aperitiv. "
9222,1712635,Refreshing and quite crisp sparkling wine. More fruit forward than usually and with low mousse. Good.

9225,1712635,Lemon and apples. Most enjoyable. Great value. 
9226,1144187,"Sea breeze on the nose, very fruity and full on the palate, but could benefit from more acidity. It's a nice steak companion."
9227,1144187,"Douro with Touriga National. Strawberry, cherry, blackberry notes. High acidity, high but already round tanins, no oak barrel."
9228,1144187,"Medium-full body. Yoghurt base with nice tannins, red fruits with cherry in the finish,  nice spice and sweetness. Aroma is of red fruits and natural yogurt. "
9229,1144187,"Strong nose of raspberry, strawberry and plums. Spices, nuts  and some wood notes ate present too. Well defined tannins. Harmonious and elegant wine. "
9230,1144187,"I already drank the 2011 wine and this 2015 is still substantial better. More balance, better nose, more profound smell. This blend is well done and the Moscatel cast gives to this wine a smooth and distinct character. I believe that wine house will give us even better wines. Portugal has wonderful wines. We only need to promote it further for the joy of millions of consumers who never tried these wine. "
9231,1144187,"Typical gastronomic wine with a dark purple color in the aroma and flavor dark fruit in the background red fruit notes of oak vanilla coffee tobacco cocoa leather earthy pepper anise licorice.  Douro is an average balanced wine with an average acidity of sharp tannins. Everyday wine, nothing special.  🍇🍷👍🏻🙂"
9232,1144187,"Enjoyable Douro with spicy aroma, fruity but not very bold palate, well integrated tannins and high acidity on the finish.  PS: The comments here are little confusing because lot of people are rating wrong wine - the white Douro from the same winery."
9233,1144187,"Full bodied nicely rounded Douro red. Not much tannin  but plenty of fruit , went well with cheese, chorizo and lamb."
9234,1144187,"Paired w/ sardinha portuguesa, bolinho de bacalhau and bacalhau com nata. Such as perfected. Cheers! "

The same is on the palate but with deeper concentration.  Super smooth and flavorful, with velvety tannins and pleasant acidity. Very food-friendly too. Two glasses went down instantly with chicken & leek pizza. The only reason I’m not rating it higher is that I’ve had even nicer touriga nacionals before."

9315,1197287,"In Happy way this wine has a taste of soil “terra”. Fully recommended, however with this price there are better ones . Vinho verde has to be a normal, doesnt have to be luxury taste. What makes these wines good is the company, place and food. "
9316,1486832,"Blackberries, raspberries, dried bananas, cinnamon, vanilla and black licorice notes combine beautifully in this powerful wine. There is a coccoa infused aftertaste that lingers on and on."
9317,1486832,"Deep, brick red color, and slightly cloudy. Aromas of cherry, oak, black licorice and mint. Acid is in-check once the wine is at the right temperature range. I didn’t look at the ABV, but it’s creating a buzz. It’s from the Douro, but paired amazingly well with an Argentine dinner of empanadas and Pao de quejo (no idea if I’m spelling that correctly!) from the El Gaucho Market. Long finish, dark fruit and cherry, but smooth. Yum!"

9325,1486832,"Aroma rich with concentration and red fruits; in the mouth, good harmony, with tannins and great balance of texture is observed. I think some aging will even be better."
9326,1486832,"Delicious and finesse, a very good value for money, one of the best Douro Touriga Nacional - This wine shows a different character. With origins in old vineyards Valley Mendiz, with 50 to 70 years old, the novelty is the combination with a percentage of Touriga Nacional from Quinta do Sibio. Very concentrated in color. Very expressive and elegant aroma dominated by notes of wild berries and cistus well combined with wood. The palate is full and balanced, very silky, fresh and intense. Final greatly extended"

9329,1486832,Super Touriga example! Very good wine
9330,1486832,Great wine with complexity and depth. Had the wine with venison and a really good match. If you like Amarone this wine will suit your taste buds. Although it is missing the bitter edge which you will find in a good Amarone. Will buy this wine again.
9331,2938966,"It's hard for me to find a Vinho Verde that I don't like. I was really happy when I bought this bottle and when opening it, from the first whiff I could tell that the content won't disappoint.

9344,2938966,Tree fruits green apple pear apricot dominate this light bodied Verde Vinho white 2016 vintage. Bought this bottle in Lisbon airport a few years back. Finally decided to open it for dinner... strong acidity that really wets the mouth. Some minerals to it and a little gassy feel to the palate. Decent. 
9345,2938966,"Very nice wine. Just the right balance,  not too sweet but you can taste the fruitiness of a vinho verde. It proves why you can't go wrong with wines from  casa santa Eulália"

Delicious!"

Aforementioned fruits on the palate with some fig and violet.  Not overly sweet at this stage, but a rich and powerful port nonetheless.  Nice single Quinta but will be interesting to watch it mature alongside classic vintage ports.  "

9425,3652286,Tried this at the vineyard! Exceptional taste but at average U.S.  price of $100+ I wouldn’t consider it a good value. It was half that price in Portugal 🇵🇹

9428,3652286,Excellent smooth Port!
9429,3652286,"Beautiful and complex, sweetness of dark fruit followed by earthy notes of tobacco and light smoke. Spectacularly smooth with light acidity on the back. "
9430,3652286,"An impressive range of ports on offer at the Decanter Fine Wine Encounter last weekend, including 8 from Sandeman. Good news, as I wasn't able to fit in a visit to Sandeman in Gaia in October. Sandeman have bucked the trend by not declaring a vintage port in 2017. This young Quinta has a real concentration of fruit, 2017 is such an intense vintage. Deeply coloured and sticky. Leafy, spicy. Palate seems well balanced. Very good, although it lacks the awesome intensity of e.g. the Quinta do Noval 2017."
9431,3652286,"Sandeman’s single Quinta do Seixo (pronounced ‘say-ch’) is a wonderful spot to visit. Whilst drinkable now but keep this for 20+ years.  Inky deep purple. M+ aroma intensity w. chocolate-covered raisin & crème de fraise. Vivid w. violet & dried currants. Anise, black pepper, liquorice & Szechuan spice. Youthful.  Sweet. Very rich w. high alc heat, high grippy tannins, m+ acid, juicy blackberry, caramelised blackcurrant & black cherry. Vanilla, liquorice, aniseed, chilli jam, crème de cassis & a long finish."
9432,3652286,Very sweet and smooth!! The very best Porto I’ve had so far!
9433,3652286,This is one or best porto wine I've had for a Very long time. Sweet and soft with low acidity and wonderfully structured. This was a very nice experience specially when compared with other way more expensive options.
9434,3652286,"Since it’s WDW I’m following @[1|10995390|Red] and @[1|17931985|Cs Runner] by sacrificing this vintage port for a✅.  It’s actually very rich and delicious now, so why not?  👁 deep opaque purple  👃 dusty cigar box, dried cherries 🍒 and fig 👅 flavors exceed aromas, dried fig, prune, rum soaked raisins and candied orange 🍊 with honey 🍯 and toffee; dried figs linger for minutes. Unctuously sweet, decadent as you can imagine, 20% alcohol. 😋 RS #254 "
9435,3652286,"Gosh! Golly! Dang! Geewhiz! A Port turned me on my head? Holy cow! As luxurious a wine as I’ve had. Sweet but not too sweet, complex flavors and a long, viscuous finish. This suckah wins the gold!  Run, don’t walk, to wherever you can buy some today!!"
9436,6950257,"OK...on the nose are berries, cherry, blackberry, strawberry, cassis  Smooth on the palate, nearly fruity and then...it hammers you with 15% alcohol....it is completely hidden, but yes it is a powerful and ripe wine....so close to port but....no...still a wine  Enjoyed it very much"
9437,6950257,"Dark chocolate, tobacco, sour Cherry, sea salt, with a medium body and deep flavor but bright acid. Absolutely delicious, probably best with fatty beef or pork. "
9438,6950257,"Great vine, amazing packaging 🙂"
9439,6950257,"Young and heavy, lacks prolonged taste"
9440,7756474,"Splendid white from Bairrada! This rich and crisp varietal of Sercialinho, aged in large oak barrels, is a singular wine with limited production (only 2000 bottles made), from the largest Portuguese wine producer. Complex, elegant and concentrated, with vivid acidity and great length. Golden yellow color, floral, peach and citrus aromas/flavors, mineral, with notes of smoke, salinity and fruits compote. Dry, creamy and fresh, with a juicy lingering finish. Exquisite, with excellent aging potential!"
9441,5005801,"1,5L, just quietly."
9442,5005801,Very aromatic but lacking a little oomph on the tongue. Delicate with nuances of minerals and blossom. Good vanilla backdrop. Pleasant and polite. 
9443,5005801,"3.7 really interesting Portuguese white. Vibrant yellow, strong oaky notes, with lots of peach and burnt toast. Melted in the mouth and a great accompaniment to a fish dinner with friends."
9444,5005801,"In about a year, fruit has gone from tropical notes to crisp green apple. The oak is more prominent with vanilla. Nice acidity. Different than last TN but still very nice."
9445,5005801,"Okay, black fruits, delicious "
9446,5005801,"[PT in comments] Alentejo blend made from Antão Vaz and Arinto, bought at Vivino.  Very skimpy on the nose with aromas of oak, some peach and apricot, honey, citrus.  Pleasant and more open on the palate. Good fruit, honey, nectarine, melon, citrus, tropical fruit, pineapple. Herbaceous notes. Cucumber?  Medium- acidity and minerality. Very dry. Medium lemony finish.  Fresh and pleasant, well done, good summer wine. Intriguing, but no one will stand up for an encore."
9447,5005801,Full bodied some tannin and perfect with meat 
9448,5005801,"3.6, some oak, nectarine, lacked a bit of acidity to stand up against a battered hake dish."

9450,5005801,"If u want to get into dry wine, it’s a good start "

9452,5005801,Thank goodness smooth
9453,5005801,"Rich notes, oak flavors but fails to deliver the robust character of wines of the region."
9454,5005801,Full taste and bold. Good with red meat
9455,5005801,Very tasty ! Chocolatey aftertaste
9456,1843934,"Supermarket series, back to Alentejo, this is okay, doesn’t disappoint, considering the price to quality ratio.  👃 full of life and warm, a strong aroma of spices and minerals, such as salt( very common in wine from this region), butter and leather. Red fruit ( cranberry and strawberry jam) with a touch of cigar.  🍷 light bodied nevertheless vibrant and vivid, low to medium acidity, a watered down texture, sweet with good tannins and a mild but persistent aftertaste."

9459,1843934,"3,5⭐Competent red from Tejo. At a friends meeting, not much time for detailed TN."
9460,1843934,"We knew this was going to be cheap. Medium+ nose of all sorts of fruit, mainly black plum, blueberry, jam, red cherry. On the palate it is dry with medium+ acidity, medium alcohol, medium+ body, pronounced intensity and medium finish. A bit unbalanced but you get what you pay for"
9461,1843934,This is awesome. 
9462,1843934,Fantastic. Very soft tanins and long lasting on the palate. Easy to drink with dark red colours.  Note: Drink the 1.5L bottle. The Normal one isn’t as good. 
9463,1843934,Portugal degustation #4. Fresh red fruits and mild tannins. Really reminiscent of easy-going pinot noir or gamay. Well received at lunch with pasta al pomodoro with burrata. 
9464,1843934,"Fruity, full bodied & very very drinkable - amazing value "
9465,1843934,Vegan what else? #veganwhatelse
9466,1843934,Medium body. Cherry and strawberries in balance with vanilla and chocolate. Very good one !
9467,1843934,In Portugal even economy wines are delicious. Most underrated wine country ever!
9468,1843934,This was a pleasant surprise for an airplane wine! Actually quite good. Nice plum flavors and earthy aromas. Paired well with red meat. Nice and smooth and full-bodied. 
9469,1843934,"The nose of this one is fantastic! Big floral violet notes with a nice red fruit, cherry like. Tannins and little spice are present."
9470,1843934,"Bold, full body, polished tannins, after taste calls attention, I liked it! Cheers! "
9471,1180025,"Straw golden yellow. Bit greenish. Nose citrus,  white flowers and pleasant bitterish sub smell. Taste balanced fruit and mixed bitterness. Salt. "
9472,1180025,Very nice! Lightly acidic Green apple Citrus Touches of pear Pleasant in mouth and nice finale and aftertaste Excellent value 
9473,1180025,Beautiful white with a chorus of flavours including lemon and peach and grapefruit. The arinto grape has a high level of acidity which also imparts character on well made wines of this grape. Saúde!
9474,1180025,"Lovely stone fruit on the back of the tongue, peach, delightful subtle sweetness too, really pleasant."
9475,1180025,"Citrus and peach in the nose, slightly oily structure in the palate, mandarine orange,  faintly pear and tropical fruit, oak ish. Well balanced.l "
9476,1180025,"Pale yellow color with greenish tones. Good balance and structure. Citrus, peach, straw, minerals, butter and some floral notes on the palate. Good match with shrimps, parsnip pyre and blood orange."
9477,1180025,Yellow colour Stone fruit on the nose Stone fruit; flint (thanks @[1|30593576|Jaakko Paarvala]) in the round and complex taste Acidity and typical portuguese white bitterness for structure
9478,1180025,"Pale greenish in color, somewhat also resembles sauvignon blanc in aromes. Grass, elderflower. Nice alternative for all those German whites."
9479,1180025,"Hands down my favorite white of our Portugal trip. Arinto was a great discovery! Apricot, white peach, mineral notes on the nose, stone fruit continue on the palate, high acidity, medium bodied. A bit reminiscent of certain French Chardonnays - perhaps why I liked this so much."
9480,1180025,"4⭐️ for this Portuguese Lisbon Bucelas 🇵🇹 white wine. 👁 Clear visual with a straw pale color. 👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry and fresh with fruits and a second sniff focused on white fruits like peach and some citrine fruits, orange. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of white fruits; medium body. Good persistence in the mouth with medium finish. Elegant white wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🥂 "
9481,1180025,"Delicate white with a beautiful character. Subtle nose with fruit and a touch of oak. Very elegant acidity, perfectly balanced. Notes of peach and lemon. Lovely straw colour and a very pleasant finish that makes you want another sip!"
9482,1180025,"Portuguese Hock indeed. Fresh, open and cool nose of pear drops, mandarin and various stone fruits. Bright and precise fruit with a crisp, yet concentrated structure and mouth feel. A full set of citrus fruits ends with a surprisingly mineral and slaty feel à la Rhine Riesling. The native Arinto grape togheter with a terroir just north of Lisbon delivers a thoroughly genuine, light and fruity experience. A first for me, and almost too cool for school. A light barrel kiss adds vanilla as a final touch. 15,5p"
9483,1180025,Buttery and lots of oak on the nose and palate. Full bodied white. Very similar to Chardonnay. Went well with food
9484,1180025,"Medium yellow. Lemon, peach, oak, marzipan, chamomile. Flint and white pepper on palate. High acidity, dry, persistent finish. Grippy, phenolic, green, spicy and a bit steely. Better with food. "
9485,1180025,"Greenish yellow. Pears and peaches, some citrus. "

9487,1302544,"Gorgeous wine from one of the top Douro producers. Silky smooth texture. Notions of kirche, blueberry skins. Undertones of cassia bark and coffee beans. Smooth leathery texture. I would happily buy this again and punches above its price in my opinion. Please note however, you will need to decent this for at least 2-3 hours to allow the wine to open up and improve with time. It was too tight when first opened.  Day two however, wow. A solid 4.5."
9488,1302544,"Spectacular Douro! A perfect finish, bold and elegantly smooth. Hints of chocolate, leather, and strawberry."
9489,1302544,Very elegant and harmousious. Very balanced and persistent in mouth.
9490,1302544,"This wine is so good, I was recommended this year and brand in Lisbon, Portugal. When I got it back to the states it went perfect with our evening. Smooth and Rich with great flavor - Red with a punch."
9491,1302544,Velvet; berries; long lasting 
9492,1302544,"This single variety wine displays with beauty the potential of Douro number one grape 🍇 a classy, elegant and fruity wine with yet a complex character 🍷"
9493,1302544,Very good. Better than I thought. 
9494,1302544,"Great wine from AXA millesimes. Deep, super round. Chocolate and black berries. Long finish. With air opens up. Loved it a lot"
9495,1302544,"Well structured Touriga Nacional from a leading Port house - they know their stuff! Dominated by blackberry, black plum and cherry with secondary notes of clove, vanilla and smoke. Some tertiary of leather and chocolate. Medium + body, medium alcohol, great structure. Will age, though drinking well already. "
9496,1302544,"Quinta do Noval Touriga Nacional Douro 2016 is a big red that is great now, but could benefit from five to 10 more years in the bottle.  Stick your nose into the glass and you find blackberry, blueberry, overripe red plum, oak, leather, earth, pepper, and lavender, which you also find on the palate.  The wine structure supports a braised short rib with duck fat cauliflower purée, as the tannins smoothens the dish and brings out the flavors in the food."
9497,1302544,"The work to make a single blend in touriga is an excellent start. Balenced, surprisingly fresh and fruity with clear notes of wood and a proper care by the wine maker. A really good surprise in the offer of this whine house. "
9498,1302544,"Deep dark ruby colour. Atimas of licorice, meaty, leather, black fruits. On the palare,tannins are strong, medium alcohol and body,medium acidity, long finish. Touriga nacional is a very under-appreciated variety,but it is really great here, with good balance and finesse, grown at some altitude and picked at the right time"
9499,1302544,"Quite simply an excellent wine for the price. Very smooth, soft tannins and a very long finish. Excellent to drink on its own but even more so with a lovely steak / lamb dish. An extremely good find!"
9500,1302544,"Red and black berries, nice tannins and great dept"
9501,1393914,"A really good, sweet and yet powerfull and nuanced port."
9502,1393914,"Last two from Ramos Pinto. This is a single Quinta vintage port from Ervamoira, the same site that Ramos Pinto use to produce their 10 year old tawny. Really young and violaceous, even more obviously so than Ramos Pinto's 2014 LBV. Very much in the producer's elegant and balanced style. Ripe red fruit, plum and cherry, with spice, tar, chocolate, liquorice. A lot of concentration and finesse, this is priced at almost the same level as Ramos Pinto's declared vintage years, and I now understand why. Keep. "
9503,1393914,"Well balanced, perfectly sweet. Blackberries and blueberries are killing "
9504,1393914,"4.3 for this amazing dark ruby port, with plenty of coffee, chocolate, mature fruits with a good balance and structure and a great long lenght."
9505,1393914,"This is exactly what I expect from a port wine. Extremely balanced and smooth. Acidity and sweetness perfectly in tune, delivering beautiful hints of raisins, confited berries and pomegranate molasses, a timid note of coffee closing. Outstanding!"
9506,1393914,"90p. Ramos Pinto #2. The '05 Vintage Port was bottled in '07. A premature opening of the bottle! 👁 Tight dark red, almost purple. 👃 Deep fruit, somehow closed at this stage. Canned dark cherries & plums, mixed with dried fruit. Synthetic note of wood varnish. Sweet tobacco.  Rather sharp alcohol sensation. 👅 Intense & complex; rich fruit. Convincing mouthful. Long-lasting, slightly bitter, finish. 🎯 Fine Vintage Port, but not yet fully developed. Potential for more, save it 5-10y or more!"
9507,1393914,"Decanted for over an hour... wow. The flavours in here are ridiculous. Hidden away since '94, it's something special. Plum, blackberry, jam, and some spice - very warming. One of the classical years, apparently!"
9508,1393914,"Probably my best experience with a Port. Shared with friends (with the distancing measures), we succeeded with the rule for Vintage Ports of ""the bottle shall not touch the table once opened"". Incredibly smooth. Full in flavours and with different tastes and nuances but not intense nor liqurous.  Aromas of fresh red forest fruits. Orange peel. All sorts of nuts: raw, toasted and caramelised. Cocoa, chocolate, toffee, coffee. Vanilla. Honeys. In mouth, pure delicacy. Thin velvet, almost silk. Equilibrium."
9509,1393914,No notes taken.
9510,1393914," red fruit plum black fruit Fruktig,"
9511,1393914,"Blackberry, raisin, blackcurrant, chocolate, red cherry on the nose. M+ body. Medium tannins. Blackberry, blackcurrant, raisin and vanilla on the palate."

9513,1393914,Almost perfect. More elegance than most even though still young. Pricey though.
9514,1393914,Yes. Very good.

9517,1856274,"3.9⭐️2019 Nice and rather fresh Portuguese white blend. Aging in oak gave some banana and cream. Also it has citrus, apricot and green apple. "
9518,1856274,"Very good obviously but the somehow excessive presence of Wood doesn’t quite make it to 4. This can probably be solved with time. Overall the quality is fantastic, very clean and pure, medium length always very fresh. "
9519,1856274,Straw colored. Subtle aroma of pear and stone. Medium body. Slightly tart. Lots of citrus up front with oak in the back. 
9520,1856274,"91pts me A single vineyard effort of Ervamoira field blend with fermentation in oak and sur Lee  Ripe sweet lime, key lime pie, with a good amount of slate like mineral on top of citrous that is rounder with butter  Quite a good effort with sour mineral lime pie on the long finish and some bread with high acidity and a medium body   Will age"
9521,1856274,In the glass Pale clear yellow Slightly oily On the nose tropical bread Fruity yeast On the palate bitter almond Fresh fullbodied balanced acidity   
9522,1856274,"4.1...  White peach, flint, yogurt, and white flower. This was partially barrel aged. It is more fresh than oak aged. Crispy and saline finish. "
9523,1856274,"Had this on at the LBV 1979 Restaurant in Pinhao at the Douro. Half the wines and dishes were somehow sold out and the young staff let a ridiculous drunk and stoned party of young Brits in ... oh which by the way ruined the evening for everybody. This wine, though, was nice. A bit like a Rueda from Spain. White tropical fruits, sun and good alcohol. My pork was good to. Oink."
9524,1856274,"3.9+/5.0 Wow, what a surprise!  Unusual wine, three local Portugal grape variety. Elegant, strong, mineral nose, dominated rose oil, creamy, apricot pie, rich exotic fruits.  Good fresh acidity. Slightly unbalanced. Resume: my first experience, keep discovering. Recommended for wine geeks Eurowine special dinner, 14.11.2018"

9531,1257837,"If your question is what's the best everyday Douro I can buy, this one is the answer! Lovely, no frills, medium yet silky tannins, loads of dark fruit, fig and a tiny touch of oak. Low alcohol, medium to thin bodied, with medium legs with wonderful tastes. "
9532,1257837,"Rich, rough and ready - welcome freebie from my Lisbon hotel. I’m not looking this gift horse in the mouth. The drunken porty fruit belies its relatively tame 13.5ABVs."

9539,1257837,"Deep ruby in color. The nose has violets and other flowery aspects, almost a bubble gum note. Fruity on the palate but a bolder mouthfeel than other Douro reds I've had recently. Good length on the finish, with almost faint sweet flavors. "
9540,1257837,"Violet,  cherry red fruit"
9541,1257837,"Vinha da Urze comes from semi desertic Douro Superior, with poor soils, huge difference of temperature between day and night. The wine is more complex that you could expect at this price level, with red and dark berries flavors intertwined with spice and light oaky flavors. Great affordable Douro wine!"
9542,1257837,"Plummy, with a touch of dark berries and a hint of oak. Moderate tannins with a puckery finish. Good with a steak or burger; looking forward to trying it with pasta and sausage with a rich tomato sauce."
9543,1257837,Rich Dark forest berry taste and a beautiful dark scarlet colour.
9544,1257837,Dark red-bluish colour with lots of dark red fruit. Well-balanced with hints of chocolat and vanilla at the finish. Nice value for the money but that is all.

9579,1518098,"Rating no 500!  Pleasant surprise! Did not expect much from this wine, but was eager to try it with a halloumi- & zucchini curry with lots of freshly squeezed lime.   Sharp acidity and minerality. Notes of lime, peach & minerals. Somehow similar to an entry Chablis but with the citrus notes going towards lime rather then lemon. Feels like traces of MLF in a way that reminds med of Chablis.   Great value!"

9607,1522960,"In the color was light golden straw. Ageing in an oak barrel gives it a complex and unusual touch and remarkable complexity. In the scents, it a kind of the burnt rubberised / turpentine flavours, reminding me of a good old Riesling. Really an interesting and out of the ordinary drink! Accompany with strong fish dishes like paella or solid flavours like monk fish or Cod."
9608,1522960,"This batch, 2014, of this particular wine, is splendid. It’s light, fragrant and this is a weird word - it’s ‘nimble’. Meaning? It’s incredibly easy to pair with anything and you could probably slurp at it quickly or savour it, as I did. It’s crisp and refreshing but doesn’t make you feel sluggish in a hot climate and it’s really inexpensive for this complexity and quality. Big oak on the nose when first open, (then get this), crude oil and then it becomes light and elegant! Tickle your tonsils and enjoy! "

9625,1884034,"(85/100) Easy but powerful red from Setubal region. Made with Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged 12 months on oak barrels.   Very fruity on the nose and palate, specially dark fruit, some chocolate and oak notes. High body, smooth tannins but the balance between acidity and sugar could be better.   I recommend this for people that loves new world red wines."
9626,1884034,"Decent enough blend of mainly Castelão with Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional and 12 months on oak.  Earthy nose with warm prune, cinnamon and vanilla followed by a palate with very enjoyable, lipsmacking acidity, dryish tannins and prune again. Bit on the sweet side but good with food. 3.5"

9639,2068534,"Great Douro red. Well, that was short. Ok, the typical deep red fruit, domed flavour (guess that), persistent end. Nice, not outstanding, scent.  A bit alcoholic- those 15% show up, although after a few mandatory minutes it smooths out To drink with... well, while I should say red meat, cheese, game etc. Al, it goes well with almost anything, as long as it is not a too hot environment.

I recommend with entusiasm ! Cheers !"

It has notes of dark cherry, prune and pine. Give it time to breathe, decanting is absolutely necessary for this relatively young wine. Or yes, store it in the cellar until you can comfortably refer to it as a decade-old vintage."
9704,1245750,Deep purple colour. On the nose peppercorn and oak. Flavours of cherry cassis and blackberry. Some garrigue and menthol in the middle. Balanced acidity and alcohol. Fine but firm tannins complement a medium long finish. Let it rest for a bit.

Interesting elegant wine, well made, spicy, earthy and herbal, with good depth and acidity, silky tannins, long oaky finish, and notes of dried fig, dark cherry, cinnamon, blueberry, tobacco, green pepper and clove. Excellent QPR."
9720,1177614,"3.9 very well made, absolutely ready now and will be slightly better in 2-3 years. Plum, dark cherry, blackberry, distant blueberry tobacco and leather are here as well as pleasant jam and black pepper finish. One more bottle, please. Pricewise excellent.  Почти хорошо и отлично по цене. Богатое, достаточно тонкое, красиво сделано. "
9721,1177614,"An opaque garnet yields an overall subtle nose of leather mushroom Forrest floor and green pepper fresh cut wood.... what the nose lacks in punch it makes up for in complexity....initial soft mouth feel gives way quickly to a bone dry tongue, maybe it’s too much, but the finish is long and moderately sour. "
9722,2458400,"Incredible value for money, Douro at its best: juicy, concentrated, fruity with smoky notes to give it complexity. To buy by the box!"
9723,2458400,Not sure how this wine has a rating lower than 4 stars. Well balanced and entirely enjoyable. A must buy for it's price point.

9728,2458400,Huge fruits and very juicy. Good at its price point. Says 14% on the bottle but doesn’t taste that strong. Went well with Antipasto and would fit well with Red meat. Smooth at the end.  
9729,2458400,Deep red fruit of red current and cherries with oak notes. Fairly ordinary table red but better than many Portuguese reds at the same price point. Medium to full bodied with reasonable balance.

9737,2458400,"Fruty, black grapes, cherry. Nice acid and some very shy tannins. Good with green cheese"
9738,2458400,"This is our favorite ""house wine"", pairs well with red meat and cheese. "
9739,2458400,"Voted best P/Q Douro red in 2015.   Must admit, it is very likable; 12 months new oak, 12 months in bottle shows ambition and brings deep flavors of brambles, raspberries, leather.   On the palate med+ acidity, med tannins, spicy, dark fruits, brambles. And a distinct bitter in the finish, which is typical for Douro reds. Good, 14 pts @ wittebol tasting."
9740,2458400,Vale mais do que custa.
9741,2458400,"Not as brilliant as many people told me before tasting it but surely tremendous value for money on a typical Douro, spicy and dark currant fruit, profile of wine. Fresh due to earlier picking and balanced. Good wine "

9812,1143535,"4.2 ~ 92% ($14.95) 👍 Recommended! Quinta do Crasto 🇵🇹 2014 skinny mini 🔥. Great blend of grapes 🍇 that pop dark berry, smooth sweetness (105 gs/20% abv). One of the best tasting port I’ve tried yet. Took the maestro @[1|33836584|Vlad Isak] ‘s advice and gave these 375 ml minis another shot!  Good intel 😉. Great port ~ great price!"

Sweet and aromatic nose offering dark cherry and blackberry paired with dried plum, raisin, dates and dark chocolate on top of charcoal, tobacco, caramelized almonds and toffee.

Flavours of dried fruit, marashino cherry, commingled with fresh berry fruit, oak, wet wood and chocolate. Cough syrup consistency. It could age another decade. ✔3.8 🏍😎"
9822,1143535,"This warm creamy and juicy lbv port really did it for me. Had some dark chocolate next to it, the kind that is nasty bitter on it's own, and it was quite a ride. Wishing that all wine could make anything that is bitter by itself so bearable and nice "
9823,1143535,"1014 Late Bottled Vintage Porto, Portugal. Very refined drinking. Lots of black fruit and cassis & clove, but also a semi-tart secondary apricot flavor. Lots of lush raisin and dark chocolate notes too, but carefully modulated. Very smooth, poised tannins (tobacco/coffee). Good Port; quality quite in line with the price. All said, I'll give it a solid 4.0 points."
9824,1143535,"Who doesn't love a glass of Port to close a day? Deep ruby color. Profound nose of baked plum, raisin, chocolate and jammy. Full body and long finish. Not too sweet. Should go well with chocolate lava cake. "

9830,3877455,"Nice label with a premium look to it, could be more readable - no reference to a white wine. Light yellow color, bright, some minerality signs, no legs. Good nose, mostly oak - hard to read other notes. Good palate, refreshing, strong character, it is a blend of two Portuguese grapes, round and evolving, some bitterness to it, some citrus - especially for bitter lemon and lemon zest, should be paired with some strong cheese or fish with some fat."

This one won’t change that but it was pleasing enough with the rack of ribs you can see in the background on the bbq I expertly set up 😉.

9897,1252807,Always good quality and I’ve never by disappointed. Fantastic value for money. 
9898,1162976,"Finale of the tasting at Quinta de Nápoles in Douro. Vintage port can only age in barrels for 2yrs unlike tawny port, so the rest is about what happens in the bottle. Infinitely reasonably priced vs non-fortified wine.  Nose: reductive nose. Great oxidative mushroom contrasts with prune. Marshmallow finish.  Palate: nice tension between the sweetness of concentrated fig, quince+caramelised orange and an acidity that bites. Smooth tannins. This results in an overall elegant, lingering finish."
9899,1162976,"91/100 Notes of cherry, tobacco, pepper, and leather. It smells like a wonderfully aged Pinot Noir. On the palate this is a little more elegant. There are flavors of nuttiness and toffee on the finish. The alcohol sticks a little more with this wine. Firm tannins. "
9900,1162976,"Wow, what an elegant sweet wine! Full of hazelnut, toffee and a certain je-ne-sais-quoi. Long lasting finish. 10x better than the 1978 we had 2 days later."
9901,1162976,"1982 vintage, Raisin, blackberry, blueberry, cinnamon, thyme, cranberry, nutmeg, fresh cut roses on the nose, with caramel, sea salt, molasses, honey, fig, chocolate syrup, cherry, and minerals on the palette. Really nice port that is drinking well."
9902,1162976,"1982 - peppery, green and timut pepper, leather, tobacco, reminds of some aged earthy Pinot noir "
9903,1162976,just wow!  such finesse and depth in this port.
9904,1162976,"This is an interesting vintage wine from Niepoort; whilst I still prefer the 1987 (despite its nearly excessive volatile acidity (and let’s not even begin to speak about the 1985)), there is no shortage of interesting aspects to enjoy about this wine: Mint, eucalyptus, a strong medicinal character, and an enjoyable cranberry flavour greet the palate and last for a considerable amount of time on the palate. Definitely worth trying!"
9905,1162976,"Cherries, almonds. Good acidity, strawberries and rhubarb, dynamic and very good. 91 points "
9906,1162976,"Not to sweet with oaky, smoky notes. "
9907,1162976,"Clear medium tawny (Amber, golden, honey) colour.  On the nose: fig, almond, caramel earthy tones.  Aroma intensity: medium.  In the mouth: chocolate, dried fruit- raisin, smoke .  Body: syrupy, smooth.  Sweet.  Tannins: Velvety, silky smooth.  Acidity: medium  Finish, long, and of light oak. This is a complex and absolutely enjoyable wine at its current age. Excellent price for quality, a recommended purchase.  "
9908,1162976,Absolute disaster. Watery sugar water with uninteresting finish. Spittoon! 
9909,1162976,"Clear amber colour. Clean condition, medium intensity, complex nose opening with candied orange, fig, vanilla, toffee, followed by kernel flavours of walnut and almond, finishing with tar and cedar. medium sweetness, balanced by medium acidity, full body with too high alcohol. Flavors of kernel and tar. Long, immense aftertaste. Balanced, Length, Complexity. Very good"
9910,1162976,Excellent port with dark fruit as well as fig/prune undertones. This will definitely be one of my to go to ports from now on.
9911,1162976,Should have drunk it earlier....
9912,1162976,"Speechless The nose is luscious with figs, raisins, burnt almonds that leads to a sumptuous palate with lashings of treacle, licorice, raisins and figs with burnt caramel. The back is amazingly complex with vanilla, oak and a sublime aniseed finish. Class"

9922,6776808,"On the nose the aromas just melt together- earthy-dusty-berries-cherries-mushroomy-nutty.  On the palate it’s dirty ripe blackberries, cinnamon and that kick of acidity that wakes you up. It walks the body borderline of medium and full with some mild but lightly dusty tannins. It finished with a pleasant lingering earthiness that I’m digging tonight.  "
9923,6776808,"Nice wine. The Vanilla comes on the nose and palet and gives way to dark fruits and a touch of Jam. Powerfull wine that is best with full flavored cheeses and smoked meats. Will also do nice with strong meats like Ossobuco or a rack of Lamb. Once you let it breathe  it softens out a bit, but the oak presence is still around. "
9924,6776808,"Not to my liking, at least this bottle. Plain with little flavor, limited nose. "

We served it to butterfried bread topped with a Skagenröra (shrimps, dill and creme fraiche) and slices of lemon. Very simple and just delicious.

(Only 2 months of wood used on the chardonnay)   Medium plus body with good intensity. Acidity is beautifully integrated with the spices of the wood what gives a sparkling after taste.  Needs some air to develop but after that this wine never fails to keep me interested 👌🏻

10028,16964,"3.8-3.9 Deep, intense to the nose with notes of tar, oak, manure, plum, almost over the top, but not quite. Palate is rich, deep, off-dry, with notable tannins, and notes of plum, raisin, blackberry, vanilla. Long tannic aftertaste. Very nice! "
10029,16964,"Intense cherrysh ruby. Main aromas of oak, dried leaves, earthy, besides red fruits, such as raspberry and cherry. Also, delicious floral notes are present. In the mouth, very nice... spicy, pretty round tannins, but persistent. Retro smell of coffee and cherry. Completely well balanced! Really good!"
10030,16964,"Intense nose of red fruit, cherry, violet and lavender and plenty of alcohol. Medium/deep purple color.   Dry pallet, medium+ body, medium+ accidity, medium elegant tannins. Notes of cherry, plum, blackberry, raspberry and a bit of pepper and licorice. Long fruity finish and aftertaste. Intense fruit, missing structure.   Easy to drink, very good QPR since it’s very cheap (under 10 euro), drink now, suitable for further aging. 3.8🌟"
10031,16964,"3.8 Red blue, mostly clear, color. Plum, Red fruit, cherry, cranberry, oak. Medium+ body, fruity, medium tannins, good acidity. Sour cherry, quite long aftertaste. Decent medium body wine but won't buy again."
10032,16964,"Let's get this 𝙌-week going!  Douro Valley. Produced by 𝙌uinta do Vallado. Grape varieties containing touriga franca, touriga nacional, tinta roriz and sousão. Balanced with a good structure. Medium bodied. Medium acidity. Medium tannins   Fruity and floral on the nose with plum, violet & chocolate. Some matured earthy notes. On palate oak, blackberry, cherry, pepper & chocolate.   Earlier experiences from this winery have, just as this time, been pleasant. A good weekday foodwine. Recommended. 3,9 stars"
10033,1496958,"Not really a port person, but that's also because I never really put the effort in. This seems like a very fine entry into the world of port. It's got raisin, caramel, chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Very smooth. My only complaint would be that the alcohol is just a tiny bit too noticable."
10034,1496958,"Lovely delicious port wine with lots of velvety soft taste and fullness for the palate and the taste.  The taste offers vanilla, almond, oak, raisins and dates.  Definitely a port wine on the finer end and recommendable."
10035,1496958,My first colheita and im pleased. Tasted much as the 20 yrs tawny and its my cup of tea. 
10036,1496958,No notes but really enjoyed it!
10037,1496958,Some raisin and date and also has since acidity. Good with warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. Alcohol a bit too noticeable but still ok.
10038,1496958,"Layers of complexity. Earthy, oak, brown sugar and maybe some fig. Hot finish "
10039,1496958,"These ports from Quevedo were our advent calendar this year. I’m not going to try to describe each one individually - that would be far too difficult.  Basically, however, the best ones were the older single vintages. There weren’t many that I didn’t like at all and I’d buy most of them again!"
10040,1496958,"Medium deep red color and a yellowish rim. Prunes, brown raisins, almonds, brown suggar, citrus peal, vanilla, spice and ethanol at the nose. Fairly light/ not overly sweet moutfull of dried fruits turning into brown suggar spice and orange peal like flavours. Somewhat short for a colheita. "
10041,1496958,"A Colheita is a Single harvest Tawny Port. 🍇 35% Touriga Franca, 15% Touriga Nacional, 20% Tinta Roriz, 10% Tinta Barroca, 8% Tinto Cão and 12% other. Bottled 2018. Aged min 7 years in oak. Med to deep garnet. Aromas of raisins, dried figs, orange peels, plums, Christmas spices, toasted oak and cherries 🍒.

With apple cake."
10042,1496958,"A dark brown with a hint of pink colour. It wasn’t a vintage port year, strong acidity. Almonds, toffee and raisins. "
10043,1496958,Lush example from this quality winery
10044,1496958,"Excellent parfum,  arômes de fruit "
10045,1496958,To much syrup taste. 
10046,1496958,That’s very delicious! Was blown away by the first sip tbh.
10047,1496958,Very nice colheita. Very fresh with red berries and eucalyptus. Not so much raisons and plum as expected
10048,1917169,"Resin springs to mind. Full bodied proper Douro, needs a bit of refinement, but you can taste the quality of the winemakers. Should become better wth  new vintages"
10049,1917169,"Super light straw color.   Light green apple aromas.   Strong minerality, a bit briny on the palate. Nice and cleansing after a day touring the port wineries in Porto. "
10050,1917169,"Green Apple, pear, lemon, grapefruit, tropical fruit, mint, oak and buttery notrs. Dry. Crisp acidity."
10051,1917169,Very easy drinking. Excellent price point. 
10052,1917169,Citrus everywhere... Crispy nice... Actually I love Duoro....

10058,1917169,"Light, straw-colored, fruity. Some lemon, akin to Pinot Grigio. Had at Time Our market in Lisbon. Goes well with grilled octopus and cod fritters. "
10059,1917169,"Some quite endearing floral / apple scents at the start lead into a surprisingly appealing experience on the palate - still trying to work it all out but there are delicate peach & apple flavours with a fluffy lemon underlay, hints of tropical fruits and a finish with gentle mineral qualities in pursuit. Summary: Quality at an affordable price - extra 1/2 ⭐️ for the QPR here!"
10060,1917169,"Nothing special, but assist with fish and prawns. Was provided at TimeOut market food-court in Lisbon. "
10061,1917169,"More than a touch of Fino here. Oh so Dry, little green apple and salt. Musty old sherry. Liked it very much. "
10062,1917169,Dry salty nutty
10063,6279072,Dry with some fresh fruit notes
10064,6279072,"Got this at the train station in Pocinho. Dry, nice tinto."
10065,6279072,"Bought from a boutique shop that specializes in smaller producers. High alt. Douro with an old world flavor. Somehow the imagery on the label evokes stone walls and castles. I imagine the taste of nobility with each sip. It sounds cheesy, but true. Find your own bottle. "
10066,6279072,"3.7 Medium to full, oily. Sour cherries, cassis, leather, white pepper, vanilla ice cream. A bit short, but had it in wine bar by glass. So, it could be just because bring open to long."
10067,6279072,Due to high work load here’s a batch of ratings-only wines - texts will resume ASAP 😅🤓
10068,6279072,wow great wine
10069,1486832,"Aroma rich with concentration and red fruits; in the mouth, good harmony, with tannins and great balance of texture is observed. I think some aging will even be better."
10070,1486832,"Dark ruby-red color in the glass! The aromas are very complex and reminiscent of wild berries combined with subtle oak-notes! On the palate full-bodied, but soft, fresh and intense! Very long finish! Cheers!"
10071,1486832,Super Touriga example! Very good wine
10072,1486832,Fullbodeoied Portuguese red. Will have again. 
10073,1486832,Great red Douro! Highly recommended
10074,1486832,Bold & full of fruit this full bodied Douro red is a great example of what this region offers.  Dull label but the bottle contents doesn't disappoint!
10075,1486832,"Red berries scent, medium strong wood impression. Ruby- red intend color. ""Crisp"" nose. Typical Douro: Fruity yet rather dry than medium dry. A little plum, a floral note close to violets. Wood is beautifully balanced. Little to no tannins towards the end. Medium long yet smooth finish. The 14 % alcohol do not show. Beautifully balanced wine yet not exactly at bargain price. Like a ""Bordeaux without a sting "" : intensive red wine without the usual wood finish or heavy tannins."
10076,1486832,Wine tasting in Portugal
10077,1486832,Takes time to deliver flavors of black cherry with a hint of mint on the nose.  14% alcohol. Cork.
10078,1486832,"Slightly more interesting than the 2012, but considering the price point, it’s too simple "
10079,1486832,Some red fruits and musk in nose. Little rough in mouth. Seems too young 
10080,1486832,"just for my records (came across the photo from an event a couple of years ago) - found it distinctly underwhelming (if memory serves, hampered by too much freshness) - will give them another go but this time trying the Touriga Franca..."
10081,1486832,Nice full bodied red. Easy to drink.
10082,1486832,"Imagine a small but fluffy pine cone launched from orbit, travelling at near terminal velocity, then received directly into a moist satchel. This is the effect this wine provides. It's a peacock in neon speedos. "
10083,1486832,"Great acidity, dark fruit, vanilla great end"
10084,1311676,"Pearly pale yellow color.  Nice bitter  almond,  hazelnut marzipan, yet still smooth and creamy. Really easy drinking, pleasant even not iceberg-cold."
10085,1311676,"Strawberry,   almond, and  brioche"
10086,1311676,AIS-94 To be paired with a Puros de Hostos Sommelier Panatela or Robusto.  Nicely harmonious and very well balanced.  ¡ Enjoy and Salud!
10087,1311676,"At vintage house hotel at Pinhao Douro Valley. Traditional method, breakfast, slight pink hue, light straw, 13.5% alc nose not much, palate: moose, off dry, mineral, long lasting "
10088,1311676,"The French, just paid 8 euros for this bottle. Never tried BdN from Portugal. Color a touch pinkish. Very strong Carbo for the first minutes. Fruit forward nose and intense alcohol smell present, ohh! 13.5 degrees. First mouth too intense. Let it breath a bit. Then delicate strawberry flavor, nutty aftertaste. Great wine price taste and quite original. Advice, If you find it you buy 6 of those. "
10089,1311676,"# 42/100 Roadtrip Madrid <-> Porto.  Vintage House. Very good, especially for value."
10090,1311676,Nice bubbles with a nose of lemon and brioche. Taste of  cream and apple and a medium finish.                          
10091,1311676,"Young strawberry, hazelnut or almond butter,  cream, zesty! Would be perfect on a hot and sunny day"
10092,1311676,Extremely good balance but would be best with smaller/smoother bubbles.
10093,1311676,One of the best Portuguese bubbly I've tried.
10094,1311676, strawberry brioche cream almond
10095,1311676,Smooth very easy to drink
10096,1311676,"Beautiful espumante, just right acidity, perfect nose, small, even bubbles. Just drink as much as you can:)"
10097,1311676,"well done, dry and balanced."
10098,1311676,Excellent as a dry sparkling wine. Not rich in flavor but wonderfully smooth.  Great value for money
10099,1208733,Smooth.. like way too smooth.. like so smooth we drank the whole bottle before the appetizers even arrived... excellent every day wine 
10100,1208733,A good up front hit of fruit with a slight astringent note that softens in the mouth. A decent finish that is dark cherry and slightly savoury. Good balance and a good match with the various Portuguese tapas we were eating.
10101,1208733,We bought it a few times now yum!
10102,1208733,Really nice and decent wine!
10103,1208733,Mild slight tannins. Good Tinto from smaller province
10104,1208733,A little immature still with high tannic palate. 
10105,1208733,Easy to drink
10106,1208733,"Veeeeery smooth. Medium to light body, with soft hints of wood. It's great by itself or with Italian food"
10107,1208733,This shit rocks! I am gay!
10108,1208733,A nice dry fruity reminder of Provence . Taste of red berries and wild flowers. Very good to be just enjoyed in the sun or with a salad. Palate is refreshing good.
10109,1208733,Excellent at this price point. Really easy drinking red.
10110,1208733,Matt and I drank this in Portugal at the wine bar 
10111,1208733,"A bit woody, but very good"
10112,1208733,Impressive for the price for daily drinking :-)

10115,1208733,"Good everyday wine, great price"
10116,1208733,Chocolate tasting wine.
10117,1208733,"What a bomb! 9 years on, smooth, let it stay in the decanter for an hour. The nose is not remarkable, with a lot of oak and yeast and old stuff in there. But once you take a sip, the mouth fills up with that silky smooth body, now a medium, red fruit, jam. My wife loved it as well. Good finish "
10118,1208733,"Dry, fruity, medium body. We can wait 3 years at least."
10119,1208733,Good for red meat
10120,1208733,A nice dry fruity reminder of Provence . Taste of red berries and wild flowers. Very good to be just enjoyed in the sun or with a salad. Palate is refreshing good.
10121,1208733,A bit like a grand vin de Bordeaux AOC. I'm not impressed.  Concentrated dark fruit without any depth. Okay to drink with a daily meal. Its price reflects its quality.
10122,1208733,"A bit woody, but very good"
10123,1208733,Black cherry. Easy drinking. Sweet. 
10124,1208733,"Medium bodied, rich berry flavour, slight tobacco, with a dry finish.  An interesting blend, good value for $15 (LCBO)."
10125,1208733,"Nice and good value wine. Ruby in color.  His is a bit over the peak so next time I will drink it three years after vintage. Still the nose is herbal, a bit of oak, some fruit not as much as I had expected. On the palate it is surprisingly hot based on the label saying 14% Alcohol. It is subtle and understated. Medium body. Not bad with grilled salmon.  Drank in April 2017."
10126,1208733,Smooth.. like way too smooth.. like so smooth we drank the whole bottle before the appetizers even arrived... excellent every day wine 
10127,1208733,Nothing too exciting about this wine... Easy drinking...
10128,1208733,One of Charlie’s wines from Portugal. Excellent for the price. 
10129,16965,"Very interesting wine, bold.. Had it at Praia no Parque in Lisbon. Went wonderfully with Ribeye and Vazia Waguy sirloin, coupled with truffle mashed potatoes "
10130,16965,Cigar boxes rich rounded slight tannins after it breathes.  Yet another lovely Portuguese red. Red grapes and a dragon fruit tang  A perfect match with my traditional coq au vin
10131,16965,"The wine to have from Quinta do Vallado. This Sousão developed very well after 20 months of oak ageing. The chocolate aromas are very present and the earthy tones bring all together. It has some fig, raisin and plum and even some pepper. Brilliant red wine!!!"
10132,16965,"Ripe fruit on nose Coffee, blueberry, cranberry, walnut, chocolate.......complicate taste.  Paired with Coq au vin"
10133,16965,"Excellent, even though still young. Sousao is a rare and interesting grape. Strong and aromatic, dark fruit, plum, oak and tobacco"
10134,16965,"3.8 Decent bottle. Quite straightforward basement of cherry - oaky taste, interesting salty taste on top (reminds maremma a bit for this layer).  Integrity: 4 Taste: 4 Length: 3+ Color: 4 Nose: 3+"
10135,16965,"Great wine. Very tannins and fruity. On the nose, plum, dark fruit and leather notes. Full body, low acidity and high tannins. On palate, plum, chocolate and leather notes. Medium finish. "
10136,16965,"Oak and tobacco the nose with Dark fruit. High tannins, nicely structured, rough around the edges but with character. Long finish, not overly complex but still a wine with weight. "
10137,16965,"Nose of leather, blackberry, plum. Medium body, moderate acidity with some structure. Notes of dark fruits, prune, chocolate. "
10138,16965,"🇵🇹 Enorme vinho tinto do Douro, cor rubi escuro opaco, nariz frutos pretos a realçar ameixa, notas de especiarias, na boca, encorpado, potente, amadeirado, acidez e taninos presentes mas controlados, final com boa percistencia.  🇬🇧 Huge Douro red wine, opaque dark ruby ​​color, black fruit nose with plum accent, spicy notes in the mouth, full-bodied, potent, woody, acidity and tannins present but controlled, final with good persistence."

10140,16965,"PnP...simply gorgeous! This is a 100% Sousão from Quinta do Vallado in the appellation of Douro DOC. Malolactic fermentation and ageing in 225 litres French Oak barrels (30% new, 70% used) for 18 months. 13.6k bottles made. This beautiful perfumey smooth deep purple has loads of blackcurrant, tobacco, eucalyptus, pepper, herbs, and much later on, chocolate. SUPER good QPR stuff that blows the mainstream overpriced commercial big boys out of the water. MUST TRY. I'm a happy camper. 4.1/5.0"
10141,16965,"Smooth, balanced, no bite.  No need to let it sit.  One of the highest quality Portuguese wines I have had.  Worth the price.  "

10153,1635822,"Good wine, medium bodied with a smooth flavour and leathery texture. Notes of raspberry, stone and asparagus. Forward notes are faint, but tastes smoothly flow to create a stronger more defined finish.

10154,1635822, easy to drink
10155,1635822,"Dry, fruity. young fruits. "
10156,1635822,"Musty and and jam like taste of this wine really catches the attention at first sip, but to get the  best experience allow it to breathe for a while.  "
10157,1635822,"3.3. Next up, a Portuguese red made from Castelao grapes, not one I'd rush back to. A simple wine, with bramble berry, strawberry, black pepper, and licorice on the nose and palate. Medium finish."

10160,2589723,"Plum, cherry, raspberry, dry earth, leather, campfire smoke, cinnamon, nutmeg, freshly cut oak (on second thought, sandalwood), with faintly green notes running in the background. Wonderfully dry but with slightly grainy tannins. Isn't it great when your boss hands you free wine?"

10162,2589723,"Surprising Douro red, quite fruity, good acidity balance with oak notes. Enjoyable. "

10175,1270336,"Wonderful white. 100 % bical. Mineral, fresh, strong in the mouth. The nose is fruity. Try it. "
10176,1270336,"4.5⭐️ for this Portuguese Bairrada 🇵🇹 white wine. 👁 Clear visual with a straw pale color.👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry and fresh with citrine and white fruits and a second sniff focused on pear, vegetables, some citrine fruits and flowers. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of flowers andar white fruits. Good persistence in the mouth with medium finish. Elegance white wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🥂"
10177,1270336,a serendipitous discovery of Bical grape by a great producer 
10178,1270336,"Green apple, lime, honey, great maturity and a touch of wood. "
10179,1270336,"3,2⭐️ I don’t think Bical is my kind of grape...I have a soft spot for the wines of Filippa Pato and William Wouters but this one can’t convince me... The fruit doesn’t deliver in an intense way, in the back something that reminds me of rubber and herbs. I do misssome depth on the palate. 28,00€/bottle? I don’t know..."
10180,1270336,"[Portugal Collection Tasting] Distinctive white pairing Arinto with Bical. It’s definitely interesting, from the warm nose with stone fruit, rhubarb and aged rubber to the nutty palate with in your face, slightly harsh acidity, some malolactic notes and a good length in the finish. 3.6"
10181,1270336,"Terrifying nose—is that pineapple and melted rubber bands?—but she’s elegant! I like her! Mostly vegetal, but alluring green apple and underripe peach too. Nicely round but not flabby. The tannins don’t want trouble; they just came to have a good time. Unhinged out of the bottle but give it some air. Classy, bougie, rachet."
10182,1270336,Floral and mineral bomb. Pretty viognier-like but higher acid. Oak has been very well integrated. Cool wine! Great length also.
10183,1270336,"100% Bical grape from Beiras in Portugal. Smoke, flint and citrus on the nose. Crisp and fresh palate of lemon, stone fruit and strong notes of minerals. Light/medium body and medium(+) acidity. "
10184,1270336,"Super interesting stuff here again from Filipa Pato.   Find Portuguese whites to be a little too vegetal for me at times and yet this has wonderful pineapple, lemon sorbet, hints of cream all tied together with that incredible acidity you come to expect from a. Good Portuguese white.   92pts"
10185,1270336,"100% Bical from Bairrada, Portugal. Hand harvesting, fermentation during 8 months in vessels of 500l. Fresh, aromatic wine with notes of white flowers, apple, pear, pineapple, citrus, apricot, herbs, cream and a lot of minerals. Oily, with good acidity, long salty aftertaste. Very tasty "

Dry, high acidity, medium bodied, medium alcohol and medium plus intensity on the body. Lemon, lime, smoke, pear, cream, toasted wood.  Very good quality of wine. Can drink now; suitable for aging.   Fermented in large oak casks. "
10187,1270336,"Struck match upon opening that fades and a lot of lemon on nose. A little lemon and a lot of pear on palate. A really nice mouth filling texture. A really great value, but wasn’t quite complex enough to get to 4.5. "
10188,1270336,"High salinity, some pineapple, lemon, oak, pepper. Very portuguese.  Solid value, high rec.  $32/Astor"
10189,75021,"🇵🇹 vinho branco da região de Lisboa. Que me lembre, é o meu primeiro Arinto da famosa zona de Bucelas. Sugestão do @[1|38039239|John SLB]. Agradável.  🇵🇹 white wine from the Lisbon region. That I can remember, it's my 1st Arinto from the famous Bucelas region. Sugestion from @[1|38039239|John SLB]. Nice wine."
10190,75021,Prova to be a proven basic wine of Portugal. Drinkable but not one to return nor retire to. 
10191,75021,Dry and light. Our table crushed two of these with ease. The fresh seafood was perfect for pairing. 
10192,75021,"Good value for money. Light, fruity, rich grapefruit smell and test, with mineral afterwards. "
10193,75021,This is an excellent wine 
10194,75021,"Great white for the price. Much fruit on the nose, mineral on the mouth with some touch of the Atlantico."
10195,75021,Crisp and fresh. Fruity nose. Notes of melon.  
10196,75021,Good fresh wine. Perfect with fish dishes 👌🏾  Enjoy 😉 
10197,75021,"(81/100)  Absolutely chuffed by this and at €6 a throw, who can complain!  Beautifully sweet, apple laden palate, with a refreshing kick of lemon and beautiful almost slate like taste on the finish.   Apples and pears on the nose, that is really a rather evocative scent and pungent at the same time.   Light to medium in body, light acidity and a whole lotta refreshment.   Would recommend to anyone!"
10198,75021,"An unctuous sipper not too dissimilar to a crisp Alvarinho or the better known Albariño out of Rias Baixas. Full bouquet nose, refreshing zesty notes with a honey kick. The flavours get more interesting with each mouthful. Versatile enough to match well with most things, but a meaty fish (maybe monkfish) would be dreamy. Will certainly re-order. Lip smacking stuff that will be difficult to overlook on your wine rack/fridge."
10199,75021,"Arinto varietal from Sogrape winery. Strong bouquet, citrus, apple, hints of tropical fruit, floral, some salinity. Went well with grilled white fish. "
10200,75021,"I’m not sure may have rated this before. Hard to characterize. Not fruity, not acidic, smooth and quite frankly perfect for delicious Portuguese food! "
10201,75021,"Excellent value. Medium intensity, with a strong character. Citrus, tropical and mineral tones with a crispy finish. Good!"
10202,75021,"Good structure and acidity, 3 months batonnage, citrus and stone fruit "
10203,75021,"This started fairly restrained, too cold. White flowers started to come through with a little time and stone fruits. Lingering finish."
10204,1117321,"Muito saboroso , muito claro com um sabor floral forte e de excelente aroma.  Very tasty; very light color with a strong floral taste and excelent aroma."
10205,1117321,"Very pleasant southern Portugal white wine, from Alentejano,  a light straw-lemon color  with a greenish reflexes.  Nose: fruity, very fresh, white flowers, green grass and mineral accents.  In the mouth: fresh fruit, ripe citrus, apples, pears, peaches, spring flowers, herbs, minerals. Wine light, lively, with a pleasant acidity.  Very elegant light finish."
10206,1117321,Perfect @ Wroclaw with sea bass 😉

10210,1117321,Nice bouquet and balance of flavours. Nice wine. 
10211,1117321,"Today's Portuguese wine: simple but effective - notes of citrus, grass, asparagus and a wonderful saline perfume. Good acidity and just the thing to pair with grilled fish. "
10212,1117321,Good wine in a great middle place between dry and fruity wine. A great crowd pleaser that bring together people from both sides. Great with grilled fish. 
10213,1117321,"Peculiar aromas in this surpising white wine from the Alenejano region in Portugal. 🍇 Roupeiro and arinto 👁 Lemony colour, oily texture  👃 Wax, honeycomb, peach, chamomile, overripe pineapple, melon 👄 Wax, butter, grapefruit, peach. Medium-short finish. 3.8 🌟  "
10214,1117321,"Old style white, like they used to make them in spain and portugal 30 years ago. In 2016?? Burnt, slightly oxidized, bitter. "

10216,1117321,Fruit and flavour. Very nice wine
10217,1117321,"Full bodied harmonious wine with flafours of white fruits, yellow melon, licorice and noble wood. Quite spicy."
10218,1117321,Was expecting more from this wine’s price range and region. Smooth with a slight acidity. Medium body. 
10219,33314,"Prunes, cinnamon, butterscotch in palate, smooth vintage port. It had sediments but we managed to decant as much as possible. Nice dessert porto. "
10220,33314,"Making up for the disappointing bottle earlier, this late bottled 2000 port was aged 6 years in oak before being bottled. Nose of alcohol cherries and raspberries, taste is red fruits, leather and spice with an oak middle and dry acidic finish. Not super sweet, great with cheese."
10221,33314,"2,5 of 5 or 80-84 (Bra, ett välgjort vin / Good, a well made wine)."

Sweet with medium acidity and moderate tannins. Full body with flavours of raisins, more black fruit and blackberry. Cherry and plum jam. Very long finish with high intensity and good complexity. "
10226,33314,One word; fantastic
10227,33314,"Mmm, a little more fruit and sweeter than most ports. But it's good in a way that I kinda like at least now and then."
10228,33314,"Bright. Very sweet and dense. Honey profile. Excellent structure for a port this price. A bit hot still, but not in an offensive way. "
10229,33314,"Big nose of stewed plums, prunes with Vanilla and cinnamon. Full bodied and long finish. "
10230,33314,Smooth. Slightly dry. Excellent value. Smooth and flat finish

10234,1530504,"Great very mineral 100% bical white by Felipa Pato. Medium weight, long and perfect with elaborate fish dishes. A top Bourgogne look alike.  "
10235,1530504,"Bright fruit character with dark blackberry and blueberry, certain clay character. Very clean and pleasant mouthfeel with medium finish "
10236,1530504,"Last time I've tasted a Magnum, but it was after other 9 Magnum bottles. Now, I think this is an excellent wine, very fruity (sour cherry driven) and with a great drinkability. 9,1 PM"
10237,1530504,"A myriad of gentle red fruit such as raspberries, sour cherry and cranberry, quickly followed by a wave of dark fruit, dominated by cassis, blackberry and dried prune. Sour cherry again, very pleasant. Some smoke, lots of minerals, moss, forest undergrowth and well integrated wood smoke. All well balanced, subtle, and elegant. Taste: more of the same, with more earthy notes, hints of mushroom, but rather subdued once again. Complex, but not stunning. Had it at 4.2, but the sheer drinkability... "
10238,1530504,"Murky forest leaves, stable, blackberries, black currants, cumin on nose. Lively right in mouth flavors dancing around my tounge, tannins, blackberries, black currants, acidic, tiny touch of balsamico ♥️. Good longlived fruity acidy tannic finish. A treat indeed."
10239,1530504,A lot of red fruit. Notes of cherry raspberry cranberry dried herbs cinnamon 
10240,1530504,In love with Bical
10241,1530504,"Deep ruby colour High, fine-grained tannings Medium+ acid, dry Medium alcohol Blackberry, balsamic cherry"
10242,1530504,"Not sure I liked this as much as everyone else. Farmyard, smoke nose, plenty of fruit - cherry, raspberry -  but disappointingly short finish."
10243,1530504,"Nose is like a punch of fruit and the palate is not disappointed. Plum, black currant, cedar and sour cherry. Good length to the finish with a spicy acidic close. Lovely wine. According to the critics next year the drinking window starts on the 2017 so it is not even near its best!"
10244,1530504,"The complexity and lightness of good cru Bojo - slightly sweet red berries, mostly cherries and raspberries, some spices"
10245,1530504,"Unusual and lovely, acidic and creamy, lime and apples. I think the first bical grape I’ve tried, a 4.2, really....!!!"

10249,1248232,"Full and expressive bouquet with the scent of plums, cinnamon and vanilla. The taste is full, dense and harmonious with a wide range of flavors, from fruity to spices to chocolate. All this is supported by an extensive, well-incorporated tannin and a long finish."
10250,1248232,"Really good Portugese wine ~ bold dark purple red wine, mouth full of fruit, really lovely with my steak. "
10251,1248232,Lots of fruit and vanilla. A little low on the tannins.   @Reid’s Hotel bar terrace with amazing views of Funchal and the ocean.

10255,1248232,"Those are the surprises we like. Never tried a Douro before.   Powerful with red fruit and black fruit, some vanilla. Medium high acidity. Very well integrated. Makes a smooth wine with a medium-long finish. Very enjoyable. "

10257,1248232,Very balanced. Plum and vanilla.

10259,1248232,"Dark Ruby red color, liquorice smell, full bodied, does not need breathing, easy to drink smooth tannin, over priced compared to porca d murca reserve, similar taste. Pair with Asian fried chicken as an entree wine."

10267,2115468,"basic, a little acidic"
10268,2115468,"Solid drinking wine, she say. She thought it was 4.5, I said 3.5 - henceforth forthwith and therefore we have concluded 4. Tis versatile and it's nice wine, easy drinking without food"
10269,2115468,"Lacking some nose but tastes are compensatibg that lack: ripe smoked plum and dark cherry overwhelms mouth with gentle tannins, long lasting in afertaste. Thank you Portugesse winemaker!"
10270,2115468,"Burgundy-shaped bottle is really too confusing for this wine - this one is pretty close to Primitivo! Thick, dark, mellow and rather sweet wine - honey, charcoal notes, vanilla and hints of dried plum. Needs a bit of a time to open up. "

10277,2115468,"Deep garnet. Oaky, with musky undertone. Mouthfilling briary fruits, needed double decant to bring the wine into a good balance. Fine grain tannins, slightly jammy aftertaste. Alcohol level appeared to be higher than 13% abv as indicated on the label. "
10278,2115468,"(3,5) Although aged 6 months in Allier oak and another 5 on a bottle, this wine tastes still very young. I think it needs at least 3 more years. Too early now."
10279,1222575,"Inviting deep berry and candy nose, raspberry ripple ice cream. On palate very elegant mouthfeel with medium tannins and med plus acidity "
10280,1222575,"93 points - dark purple; nose of vanilla, oak, rubber and black fruit; taste of blackberries, anise. Layered structured wine. Peppery finish. Good tannic backbone."

10282,1222575,"2018/4 a wonderful wine from the Douro. Dark color from 3 local grapes, purple on the edges. Intense nose and slightly spicy and still very present tannins. Still to young to drink."
10283,1222575,"This is one of my favorite Douro reds! The deep dark color hints at the plum and black fruit to come, with vanilla hints, oak and spot of forest floor and mushroom scent! Decanting is the way to go; 3 hrs plus! I know this because it got better the closer I got to the bottom of the bottle!"
10284,1222575,"For me the best QDV ever released and one of the most wow Douro reds I tasted recently. Superb blend of concentration, dark wild berries fruit, and then this beautiful minerality which takes it to a whole new dimension. Reaches perfection levels."
10285,1222575,"Quinta do Vesuvius is one of the greatest estates of the Douro, its magnificent house, chapel and winery were built in 1827. The 137-hectare vineyard is largely north facing and rises from 110 meters to 450 meters, resulting in exceptionally balanced wines, among the finest in the entire region. On the palate it taste like  plum, vanilla and oak. Good acidity and pronounced tannins. My real rate is 4.6."
10286,1222575,"Appearance: dark inky red with violets hues   Nose: very expressive , perfumed nose showing scents of dark fruits , oak and spices  Palate: very intense and rich wine, bold flavours of black berries and cherries, hints of minerality, oak, spices an dliquorice Long finish "

10295,2650799,"An unusual blend. Delicious. 50% Roupeiro, 20% Rabo de Ovelha, 10% Arinto, 10% Tamarez and 10% Alicante Branco.  Really lovely nose, herby, apple, lime. Low alcohol and refreshing.  Reminds me of top class chenin. There's some fruit tannin there definitely. Could age a couple of years quite easily. A curiosity and a lovely lovely wine "
10296,2650799,"(4.2) Lovely and different Alantejo branco blend by winemaker António Maçanita. Antāo Vaz dominated, dense, fruity and full of minerals.

The nose is very flowery, violet notes and currant fruity notes, the sweet spice from oak is also in the nose.

Pronounced aroma intensity, very nutty w. concentrated walnut, hazelnut, dried apple, raisin & sultana. Fig w. wood spice, cinnamon, coffee & tobacco. Fully developed.  Sweet. Very rich & concentrated, complex w. bitter chocolate, raisin, sultana, dried fig, walnut, vanilla & buttercream. High alc, high acid & a very long finish w. low tannins, cocoa, cinnamon & toasted hazelnut. Outstanding!"
10340,2258813,"Tawny brown (not tawny style). Raisin and walnut nose. Medium acidity. Raisin, walnut, almond, dried fig body. 4.5⭐️ served chilled. "
10341,2258813,"Medium tawny. Orange peel, dried apricot, lime, ginger, spicy, caramel, honey, toasted almond. Sweet, high acidity, medium body and long finish. "

10346,2258813,"I like the ‘85 ports from the big names and was somehow expecting a step down. Silly prejudiced me. This simply is glorious fig, date, raisin and caramel. In an envelope of smokeyness for extra complexity. The aromatic power to last 10 minutes in your palate. What a beauty."
10347,2258813,"Wow - incredible .... I'm a fan of all kinds of port wines - but this one is really great.  Intensive range of flavors (rum pot, dried fruit, cherries, cigar box).  It is rich in extract - but still lively and fine. With almost 40 years!  Wow - incredible.... Ich bin ein Fan von Portweinen jeglicher Art - aber das hier ist schon grosse Klasse. Intensive Aromenpalette (Rumtopf, Dörrfrüchte, Kirschen, Cigar Box). Er ist extraktreich - aber trotzdem lebendig und fein. Mit fast 40 Jahren! "
10348,2258813,"Amazing port - the one after I really started appreciate this style! Raisins, prune, caramel, vanilla, walnut, cinnamon & oak - what a combination! Medium acidity and M+ tannins. High alcohol (20%) - but nicely integrated. Long finish. I will try try this vintage again, probably after about 10 years, because probably it can be even better. Overall: 4.6"
10349,2258813,"4.8🌟     1️⃣9️⃣8️⃣5️⃣     FOR     1️⃣9️⃣8️⃣5️⃣   Last Port on this run is Touriga Nacional based field blend. Spent 23+ years in open casks. Bottled recently as 2018.

I believe that it can improve still a tiny bit"
10351,2258813,"Clear Copper Brown colour. Intense nose of date, fig, and dried fruits. Excellent mouthfeel. Deep complex flavours. Soft powerful port. Fresh still and vibrant."
10352,2258813,"Lots of nutty characteristics,  on the nose slightly alcoholic, but as it blows off it becomes amazing. Great little wine."
10353,2258813,Bottled in 2015. Fresh with balance between sweetness and acidity. A less sweet style than current port. Excellent.
10354,1216909,Absolutely fantastic.   Glad we went here.   Overpowered the fish dish but perfect with pork.   Gorgeous wine.   Berries and that Douro taste that really comes into itself with some aerating.
10355,1216909,"Quality  Had this one in a flight with other reds from the Bourgogne and my, my... It puzzled me for a while . But pinpointed it eventually. Great aromas of red and black fruit. Nice integrated tannins, accidity. Layerd. Long finish. Could even left in the cellar for some years. Niepoort has a reputation as an inventive winemaker. The proof is in the bottle.  @tasting circle ""de wijnvrienden"" "
10356,1216909,"A brilliant medium light red colour with a complex aroma reminiscent of tea leaves and a mild earthy character and a hint of cherries. On the palate while delicate and elegant there is an underlying assertive structure with great length, minerality and freshness, along with well integrated oak leading to a harmonious soft tannin driven finish."
10357,1216909,"Feels like a youthful French wine, full body, dark berries, spicy but smooth vanilla after taste. Love it!"
10358,1216909,"Velvety. Good tannins, perfectly balanced with violets and redcurrant."
10359,1216909,Surprise to me. Multisepage. Very refined. 
10360,1216909,"what you can say about Charme... one of the top Douro wines. this 2010 vintage Its still full of power, very fresh... each drink is an extraordinary sensitive trip between blackberrys, cherrys and raspberrys, with some notes of truffles and lemmon leaves, giving it an amazing complexicity... the silky tannins and the Fantastic acidity make me wonder how many years this wine can envolve in the bottle.."
10361,1216909,What you can say about charme? Top Douro wine! Somehow spicy but with vanilla after taste... very refined!
10362,1216909,"Interesting Douro wine made in honour of the Burgundy appellation.  Light ruby in colour. Notes of ripe cherry, pine trees and more earthy aromas of dried mushrooms.  Nice freshness and elegance with a silky texture and gentle tannins.    Nicely made and pleasant, although bearing little resemblance to a Charmes Chambertin"
10363,1216909,"Aroma: red fruit, leather, mushrooms, dark earth, animalistic notes, tobacco and raisins.   Palate: very smooth and silky feeling.   Verdict: had my eye on this from day one in Portugal. Glad to see it on the wine list of a tapas bar. It’s heavily influenced by Burgundian wine making, and I can tell the wine maker is trying to making something with finesse and elegance. It is somewhat archived, but it cannot hide its Portuguese grades. And nor should it. Very complex and something for ones nose to dive in. "
10364,1216909,"One of the most elegant wines from Douro. Nose of red fruits, cherry, plum and slight hint of nuts. The first attack is silky and elegant with a nuance of one-moment pleasing sweetness. Widening and rising tannin as well as acidity creates a highlight, but continues to be comfortable but long finish. Body and scale are not impressive, but are not weaknesses. Great choice for elegant-wine lovers."
10365,1216909,"WSET level 3 Yet another good Niepoort production. Red berries, medium+ acid and tannins but a bit soft. Drink 2018-2025"
10366,1216909,"The Burgundy expression of Douro - a brilliant wine - an exclusive wine , it's all about elegance and complexity - a smooth beauty - 16 months in French barrels "
10367,1216909,"Bit overpriced when compared with other Douro options but still an elegant masterpiece. Well done, Dirk."
10368,1216909,Great.  but not worth 
10369,5256468,Very good wine... but very far from 4 stars.... well balanced but lacks of flavors and aromas... will not buu it again 
10370,5256468,"Another great wine from the Maçanita brother and sister. Pale color but with a citric boucket. First notes come with acidity, lemons and i got some vanila notes out. The finish is long and very plesant for a white wine!"
10371,5256468,"3.6. Slighty underhelmed by this Douro field blend. Maybe I don't get the subtly of this. Shy nose of baked apple, nuts, christmas spices and vanilla. Same aromas on palate. Not bad but nothing special."
10372,5256468,"Very good wine.  Nice to the nose.  Very complex but still crisp and light in the mouth.  One might think that it comes from a cooler climate.  Citrus and good acidity dominate, but there are also floral and fruity flavors.  Really long aftertaste.  Perfect for Oven-baked halibut with king crab, kohlrabi and potato-cheese croquette on New Year's Eve.  Also good as an aperitif."
10373,5256468,"Very special and different white wine from Douro made with 17 kind of grapes (Dona Branca, Rabigato, Miranda, Trincadeira Branca, Rabigato)."
10374,5256468,"Interesting wine, not for everybody. Full of aromas and flavours, very yeasty character, oxidative."
10375,5256468,One of the best contemporary wines being produced in Portugal   
10376,5256468,Full of flavor. Perfect with octapus.
10377,5256468,"Os Canivéis, is a 60 years old small parcel, planted in Carlão - Douro at

10380,1240769,Rich Portuguese red. Deep ruby colour. Aged for 6 months in oak barrels. Red fruit aromas mainly. Bold on the palate with a slight kick of alcohol. It's acceptable though. Medium bodied with a spicy finish which nicely complements the overall positive impression about this wine.

10387,1240769,"Great as a superior table wine - bold, structured red fruits"
10388,1240769,"It would be 3,5 if not the weak corky smell and taste. In nose raspberries, jam and ripe cherries with clear oaky notes. In mouth quite high acidity well balanced with slight sweetness and relatively strong, firm tannins. Not bed."
10389,1240769,Very pleasant red with deep ruby color. Rich palate due to maturation for six months in oak barrels. Well balanced notes with noticeable red fruit aroma. Good value for money. 
10390,1240769,"Middle of the road, value for money Portuguese red.  Went well with pizza."
10391,1240769,Mix of red and black fruits. Medium bodied. Plenty acid. A good every day wine.

10393,1240769,Fruits and aoks 
10394,1212859,"Really intense nose of cherries, blackberries, black currant, cherry liqueur, orange peel and a peppery finish with a touch of mint. Quite sweet but packing a lot of acidity and a good deal of tannins too. A bit clumsy now it will certainly improve over the next 10-20 years as it integrates better. 95p"

10396,1212859,"93/100 This was not a declared vintage in Port but maybe it should have been, the 2015's we tasted were wonderful. We sampled this during the tasting of the 2016 vintage declaration celebration. This surprisingly smells like a dry wine. Red fruits and Mediterranean herb notes. Long finish and big, round tannins. "
10397,1212859,"Almost black colour. In the nose massive aromas of black berries, spices and a whole load of slate minerality. On the palate there is this unbelievable concentration, tannins and acidity, both is still very young, 20 years drank too early, but with an Never ending finish. Enourmous potential!"
10398,1212859,"Portuguese wine tasting: Last wine and of course it is a Vintage Port from 2009. Complex aromas of violets, oak, dried cherries and crushed blackberries with a nice earthy touch. Also on the palate it is super-complex and balanced with lots of concentration and energy. Lots of freshness (acidity) perfectly combined with young/firm tannins and interesting hints of leather and cocoa. Looong and herbal finish with a juicy and fruity aftertaste. Simply Georgeous! This is bottled potential (min. 25 years)!"
10399,1212859,"Root beer, and amarone nose. Palette of cinnamon,vanilla and flat cola. Really enjoyable. Finish of wild blueberries. "

Dark red colour on the glass with some violet reflexes when shaking. Nose was oaky with perceptible factor of dark fruit, mostly blackberry and plum. On the palate still fruits with vanilla and pepper. Some earthy and  leather when shaking the glass very often. Need air to open. Finish was long with medium tannins and well balanced acidity. Really recommend this wine. Good one. Will back to"

10497,75982,"SPANISH LOVERS - TRY SOMETHING NEW!  Leave the clay behind and go to the schist soils of Portugal! Ferreira is called ""The Portuguese Brand"" and the indigenous grapes yield a fantastic unique style of wine.  From the brambly nose of red fruits you know you're in for a treat. The first sip is literally like a patch of earth, a sense of place. Black & bing cherries, smoke & mild tobacco leaf give way to a finish that smolders with dried fruits.  I'll definitely buy this again!"

Cherry, blackberry, very much a fruit forward wine.  Tannins were strong and left a nice aftertaste that was almost like a balsamic.  Very high quality red.  Lay this one down for a few more years. "

10516,5905459,"Normally I would give it 3,5 stars, but it only cost 4 Euro! Dark color with red reflects. In nose mostly black fruits like black berry, it has sweet notes of those fruits. In addition I feel some smoke and dark chocolate. Fruity taste, medium tannins, medium body, quite long finish, but a little bit alcoholic for me. Wine that can be drunk with pork, maybe also without meet. "

Very refreshing on the palate, same stone fruit notes as in the nose, good (medium plus) acidity, decent aftertaste, bitter lemon, some rosemary, some soft carbonate"
10542,1234518,A new test for this wine 1 year later: go down to 4* for this Vinho Verde wine. Good aroma focused on citrine fruits and mineral.

10561,1408473," Black fruit, dark chocolate and a gentle level of oak. It is well balanced and does not get spoiled by the high alcohol level. This is a wine I’ll be come back to!"
10562,1408473,"Woody (Oak), smoky. Looks like blackberries. Rich flavour, but a way to tannic for me. Anyway, it's a good wine! I would recommend to my friends!"

10566,1408473,"WOW! This is a good one, especially when considering the price tag. Lots of pepper and tobacco here. Perfect on its own or with finger food such as prosciutto and kaltbach.cheese. Not with manchego.cheese though. "
10567,1810916,High level. Late bottled gives a feeling that you’re drinking red wine with a finish of port. Oak in the palate and gentle tannins 
10568,1810916,Sediment heavy and alcohol unbalanced 
10569,1810916,Easy and smooth.

10575,1810916,"Rating goes for the surprise level, very intriguing port, from nose to palate, different from all other ports I tried before. Special nose, loads of dried fruit and vegetables - especially for green bean. Also very special palate."

Tasted in early March on the trip with the friends of Confraria Amparo in Porto, Portugal!  Muito interessante esse Porto LBV! Nariz cativante, com notas frescas de frutas vermelhas maduras, nozes, especiarias! Volume intenso no paladar! Degustado no começo de março na viagem com os amigos da Confraria Amparo, no Porto, Portugal!"
10580,1810916,"Wow, great great port Dark, alcoholic, sweet cream but not sweet wine, great body with log after taste"
10581,1810916,"Very similar to the ruby - deep red, syrupy sweet, with prevalent alcohol. I think this is a touch drier as the nose doesn’t smell sweet and the finish has some measure of acidity that cuts through the sweetness and alcohol. Fruity with cassis and blackberry as well as some tannins to give a bit of roughness on the tongue. Would love to pair with bitter chocolate or something heavy with cinnamon and allspice."
10582,1258698,No notes taken.
10583,1258698,A little minty. Beatiful colour. Woody.

10587,1258698,"Very young, and thus different from what I expect from port. But very flavourful, heaps of fruit, exquisitely balanced"
10588,1258698,"Closed on the nose in a nice way. Great sweetness with notes of black cherries. Long lasting taste, really lasting. Intense and bold!"

10591,1258698,"[Quinta do Pacheco Winery Visit 3/4] For the ports the folks at Pacheco also delivered starting with this vintage. Probably better to keep it stashed away for quite some years but it’s already very enjoyable! Vegetative nose with kirsch and warm prune followed by a palate with fantastic tannines, mellow acidity in balance with the sweetness, black cherry and strawberry. 4.0"
10592,1258698,"Tasted at the winery in the Douro Valley. What a treat. My first vintage Port and this was a pleaser. Pleasing bouquet and palette with lots of Anise and Raisin, but super well balanced and structured, with the sweetness blending beautifully with acids and tannins. Would like to bring some home!"

10595,1258698,"I’m commenting on 2017 Vintage..  quite complex to my taste: violet, red fruit , blueberry, herbacious: mint mostly, chocolate , fig & prune.. Nose and mouth were not on the same page on a single note.. went well with baby 🐐 "
10596,1258698,"I enjoyed the 2018 better than the 2017. The 2017 had more herbal tones to it, along with blackberry. "
10597,1099392,"Excellent vintage 2008 Porto,  a medium brick-brown color,  with garnet rim.  Nose: pronounced, molasses, honey, dried fruit, fried apricot, dried plum, dried fig, dates, golden raisins, candied orange peel, caramel, baked almonds, hazelnut, walnuts, sweet spices, cedar. Wine full body, elegant, smooth, with great balance between sugar, fruitiness and acidity, nice velvety texture, complex. Finish long, elegant."
10598,1099392,My Absoluut Favourite vintage Port !!
10599,1099392,"Explosion of dark fruit flavours, really fresh and elegant. Still too young with primary aromas dominating but you feel the potential already. This needs to be revisited in 20, 30 years:)"
10600,1099392,Nose: Deep sweetness. Blue grapes. Superb port scent. Mouth: Light sweetness. Soft with an edge. Spiced. Alcohol.
10601,1099392,Full bodied and full bodied with good structure. Fruity with raisins and plum on the palate. High alcohol and drinking well

10604,1099392,"A wonderful serie of 8 toplevel vintage ruby ports of this fine producer this weekend. Even now ten years old this yougest in the lineup was bursting with powerful layered black forrest fruit and alcohol integrated into the wine. Deep lengthy flavours. A wine that can age much longer. @Wakende Haan, Abcoude. Top vintage year see link below."
10605,1099392,An amazing port!
10606,1099392,Very vibrant still. Would not describe this as soft bit the flavours are awesome. Black fruit all over and many layers. A real complex port that makes me happy.
10607,1099392,"Drinking very well, smooth and ripened tannins, velvety profile but for me one of the 07s that sustains the highest tension at this stage and most promising ageing potential "
10608,1099392,"The best of the younger ones in this top lineup.  Hints of shoe polish, high quality balsamic vinegar. Very present power yet balanced. Tension, teasing, balanced and complex. Long finish. Top level, great wine. 18 pts @ Wakende Haan Abcoude."
10609,1099392,"Now this is what I'm talking about.. This really is quite extraordinary and the best vintage of the tasting. It is both extremely delicate, fresh and lively as well as extremely mature, complex and layered. Definitely worth stocking up on..

On the palate: smooth, refined, elegant, tasty, fruity, fresh and an extremely long and complex finish. wow!"

High acidity, M+ polished tannin, full-bodied, well endowed.  Abundance of flavours: liquorice, exotic spices, luscious black berries, graphite, and much more.  Still youthful, like an athlete in top form.  This is stunningly beautiful as it is, will no doubt age beautifully as well for a couple of decades or more.  Very well balanced and structured.  Recommend.  23 April 2020."
10611,1099392,"Viva Iberuly 🇵🇹😍🍷 I do drink a bit of Port but rarely post as many of them taste very similar IMHO Learning from pros @[1|14868566|Steve Standbridge] and @[1|4778104|DF] This from the magnificent 19th century Quinta from the upper Douro is definitely different  Rich, woodsy and smokey as you’d expect but packed with freshness  Juicy ripe blackberry, damsons, plums and even tart cranberry in a full body with liquorice, menthol, eucalyptol, oak spice and a super lengthy finale A joy 🍷👍🏿🍷🇵🇹 "
10612,2038239,"I really enjoy this Douro blend from Churchill’s. It has everything going for it - lovely, juicy citrus complimenting gorgeously smooth fruits with touches of nectar and ginger biscuit crumb. Summary: A confident creation verging on sublime."
10613,2038239,"Hey, this one is amazing! Starts with a citric touch then it finishes buttery. Lemon, pineapple, then some butter and white chocolate. A great white douro!"
10614,2038239,"Citrusai, truputis persiko, žolė. Kartokas poskonis. Nesudėtingas, bet gana simpatiškas.  Citruses, hint of peach, grass. Bitterish aftertaste. Quite simple but nice."
10615,2038239,"Dry and crisp, not very complex but very fresh with citrus, lemon, green apple, mineral nuances accompanied by oak and smoke. Finish is short and slightly bitter."
10616,2038239,"Acid notes in the beginning was very interesting. As it warms, it tastes more like sauvignon blanc (more acidic)."
10617,2038239,"Very clear yellow color, soft on the nose with some mineral feshness, quite intense on the pallete: flint, capsicum, grass, lemon. Mineral taste with growing acidity (but not as high as i expected), finish is with smoke and bitterness. Lasting taste. Interesting, pleasant. Good value / quality balance. "
10618,2038239,"I love a good Douro white. This is not one of those though. Rabigato & Viosinho, 20% aged in new oak, all looking good on paper but this is just vapid & empty with little to no personality.  Pale lemon. Rather steely w. m(-) aroma intensity & simple lemon & nectarine. Not much going on.  Dry. Zesty w. m+ acid, sour & lemony w. med alc, grapefruit & orange peel. Devoid of any sort of character this is extremely disappointing."
10619,2038239,"Nice combination of citruses, mineralogy and light oak. 3.7"
10620,2038239,"Soft, fruity and goes well with sea food "
10621,2038239,"It's good, easy to drink. A bit dry like many douros with a touch of fruitiness at the end. I like other, cheaper Portuguese wine though."
10622,2038239,"Fruity note, acid taste, mild to dry"
10623,2038239,"Porto & Douro Wine Tasting 2017 - Rio de Janeiro. Amarelo palha. Aromas de flores secas, baunilha, frutas maduras. Na boca é seco, acidez media, corpo medio.

10624,2038239,"Soft on the nose, vague aromas of lemon and flint. Surprisingly strong on the palate, flint, capsicum, grass, and lemon, probably enhanced by a very high acidity. Long finish. Delicious white!"
10625,2038239,"RL = VV= 4.0 Straight!  From the north of Portugal this is a mix of the grapes: Rabigato and Viosinho  This house was established at the end of XX century focused in producing Port Wine.

10657,83903,"A beariful cognac nose and body but with much lighter alcohol content it is a real pleasure. The body goes for a long time with the usual spices. Cinnamon, cloves and lots of other spices. Very nice finish. "
10658,83903,"Also part of the wine tour tasting at Blandy's, this amazing Colheita 2006. Simply splendid, full of terroir and a great ambassador or its style.   The robe: dark brown, result of a longer contact with the oak barrels. The nose: more coffee, honey and wood elements. The palate: liquorice and caramel. Grandiose!"
10659,83903,"Top Madeira!  A 2006 Colheita Malmsey (Malvasia) from historic producer Blandy.  A bit funky and fusty on opening, but this settles over 24 hours.  Dark amber.  Smells of dates, coffee, caramel, peanuts.  Tastes of raisins, walnuts, tea, burnt sugar.  Super nutty through a long finish.  Well balanced, medium/full in intensity and body, medium sweet (7/10 on a dry to sweet scale), fairly high acidity.  The Madeira ""canteiro"" heating process during winemaking means this will last for months after opening."
10660,83903,"Malmsey is the local name for the Malvasia  grape on Madeira. The instruction leads to the Baume scale 3,5 or 60 grams of residual sugar, due to fairly early stopping of the fermentation process. Brown sugar, caramel, dried aprikot, orange zest. "
10661,83903,"Final wine shared over dinner by Alex Gunz. Classic Malmsey right here. The acidity!  Med amber. Pronounced aroma intensity w. caramelised fruitcake, concentrated sultana, gingerbread, raisin & dried mango/apricot. Developing w. light honey.  Sweet. Concentrated luscious notes of raisin, sultana, fig & prune. Juicy w. mouthwatering high acid, high alc, low wood tannins & oxidative spice of liquorice root & cinnamon bun. Delicious!"

10666,83903,"Baked and dried apple, spices, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla, almonds, brown sugar, honey. High acidety. Leaves the palate fresh!  Very good length."
10667,83903,"As stated on the bottle: honey (not much), wood (yes, burned) and dry fruits. Too much spirit. It has noble tones of cogniac, with pleasant acidity balancing sweetness. "
10668,83903,"Balanced sweet Madeira with dried fruit such as figs, honey, nuts, caramel, positively oxidized. Great for toffee cake vanilla ice cream and such desserts!"
10669,83903,"Great wine. Rich, very fruit driven, nicely balanced coffe aromas, some toffeness, quince, honey, very complex but always perfectly balanced. Very good"
10670,83903,"Full of flavour, sweet but not too sweet. Dry and medium dry is too boring. Full sweet is too excess.  This fits in the Goldilocks zone and is just right."
10671,83903,"What an excellent wine. Golden amber color. Raisin, prune and orange peel on the nose. Sharp acidity, with sweetness being carried by citrus to a lingering finish. "
10672,6592254,"Herbaceous and citric, but with medium to medium plus acidity, so nice to drink. Good own interpretation of SB."
10673,6592254,A good experience  Color: straw yellow  Nose : flowers and a slice of citrus  Taste : smooth and fruity  Pairing to grill fish - not the best competition but ok
10674,6592254,"Plain table SB, nothing special about it. I still liked suppressed acidity, showed also some herbs, thyme, to and citrus and peel. Quite light and quaffy 11.5% ABV.. ok for 10€."
10675,6592254,"Citron really fresh one, with really little tone of anjs at the end"
10676,6592254,"Smooth, not sweet, easy to drink 😋"
10677,1251683,"Much less oceanic than 2015. This one brings forward notes of yellow plums, honey, orange blossoms & yellow apples. The citric notes are subtler & the salinity as well.  Medium body with a dry palate & a medium-high acidity.  '15 was a 4+ for me while this is a 4-. Still quite great with a pleasant complexity, it just doesn't have the freshness that threw me away last year."

10685,1251683,"How refreshing this Vinho Verde, 100% Alvarinho from old vines! Highlight for grapefruit notes on the nose, with a mineral nuance! Well balanced acidity! Tasted in early March on the trip with the friends of Confraria Amparo in Porto, Portugal!  Que refrescante esse Vinho Verde, 100% Alvarinho de vinhas antigas! Destaque para notas de toranja no olfato, com um nuance mineral! Acidez bem balanceada! Degustado no começo de março na viagem com os amigos da Confraria Amparo, no Porto, Portugal!"
10686,1251683,"round oily, med+ body Alvarinho, amazing how different it is from Albariño from the Spain. Winemaking process with skin contact and ageing on lees added creamines, extra texture and ripe fruitiness taste, acidity is on top level medium (+) or even high. citrus, stone fruit and chalk -y saline minerality so well known from Albariño."
10687,1251683,"Alvarinho (old vines) in granitic soil with skin contact during alcoholic fermentation. Intense aromas of grapefruit. Fresh, Mineral and high acidity . I'm sure about a very nice bottle evolution. Great wine!"
10688,1251683,"It'd been so long since my last Vinho Verde that for #Iberuly they're coming thick & fast. This is 🇪🇸🇵🇹 #7, single-varietal Alvarinho, spending 8m in barrel.  N: leesy, cheesy, slightly smoky; yeast showing through.  P: vivid citrus fruit- lemon, a squeeze of lime, an undercurrent of pithy orange. Fleeting apple & a hint of riper, fuller fruit. Bright acidity, lanolin texture, savory edge, flint. Weighty, focused med body, super long finish. Wants food: great to cut through cheese/ham croquetas. Lovely."
10689,1251683,"A very good wine that already shows good ageing notes. Medium lemon. In the nose, medium intensity with green apple, lemon, pineapple, wet stones, acacia honey, rubber, ginger. On the palate, medium intensity with green apple, acacia honey, rubber, ginger, almonds, toast, brioche (some lees contact). High acidity, medium body, medium alcohol, dry. Medium finish.  "
10690,1251683,"Apricot, peach and citrus on background. Perfect acidity."
10691,1251683,"Woody aromas in a very fresh wine give it an interesting complexity. I'd love to try it in 10 years, to sense how it evolved."
10692,1184243,"I am not good at holding wines for long:) This one was bought 1 year ago on Azores - fantastic blend! Prunes, cherry, medium tannis, really nicely balanced. Big Like!"
10693,1184243,"Wonderful ruby color. It is quite unbelievable, but I have felt in the nose some racino, berries and peach compote. Very good ending, acidity and typical Douro taste on the palate"
10694,1184243,"Frutoso, tom de madeira e toque baunilha. Final pleno."
10695,1184243,"Great wine! Completely changed after 30 minutes, so let it breathe... Full, round, smooth, classic Douro blend."

10699,1184243,Bold and fruity. Classic Portuguese wine lacking a good long aftertaste and flavour 
10700,1184243,Light golden colour.  Wonderful nose Almond shimmers through lightly. Sugarish.  Liquer with a lot of Acidity.  Lime.  Minerals. All together nice build and finish. After a little breather this wine is even better do not serve too cold.. I like a lot.
10701,1184243,"2 hour decant. Just starting to brick - significant acid and tannins, but, sadly, not quite the depth of fruit to back it up - I think this has past its best."
10702,1184243,"Not worth the price. A good wine, but too bad for this price range. "
10703,75975,"Incredible beautiful Portuguese wine one of my favorite a deep red-ruby color, with purple background and a little lighter brick rim. Nose: still pronounce, aromatic, warm, very ripe dark fruit, jam, dried fruit, raisins, leather. In the mouth: juicy fruit, ripe black and red fruit, black currant jam, spices, vanilla, toast, mint, balsamic wood, a bit of tobacco and mineral nuance. Wine complex, thick, warm, rich, multi-layered, balanced, velvety. Finish powerful and sophisticated  very long unforgettable."
10704,75975,"Outstanding Douro red! A fully matured iconic Portuguese beauty, made with a refined and rich blend of T. Franca, T. Nacional, T. Roriz and T. Cão, aged 18m in new French oak barrels.  Bold, complex, elegant and concentrated, with smooth texture, excellent acidity and terrific length. Dark ruby color, floral, red and dark fruits aromas/flavors, specially plum and currant, mineral with notes of spices, mint, anise, cedar and beautifully integrated oak. Full body, silky tannins and a delicious finish. Superb!"
10705,75975,"My rating 4,8 . Fabulous !!!"
10706,75975,Probably one of my most amazing wines I've ever tried. Still questioning if it's worth the price
10707,75975,One of the most Amazing wine in the world.

10712,75975,Fora do normal!!!
10713,75975,Perfection from portugal... what a year...  This is the most iconic wine from portugal... produced only in outstanding years..   The ferreirinha winery was took by sogrape Legend says that the decision on year was for barca velha or not was taken by dna. Antonia Ferreirinha.  Today 3 oenologs take decision... overpriced of course !
10714,75975,"A serious Portuguese wine, black fruits, ripe red fruits, elegant and integrated oak! Almost a bergamot note!!! Tannins are smooth and soft!!! With a long and dry finish! "
10715,75975,"Needs to breath for like 90 to 120 minutes.  Best of the best wine in the world imho. Do be very careful, as most are not well conserved and taste like vinagre... off wine. Otherwise this is very good.  Value wise it compares well with the best French (or else wine). Try it, won’t be disappointed. "
10716,75975,It will be hard to find some other wine like this...
10717,75975,"Note 18. The goods Barca Velha start in 2000. Good body, crispy And spicy"
10718,75975,"This great wine opened up graciously,with a deep garnet color and a nose of wet leather and fruit in compote (blackberry and blueberry), wet earth and iodine, somewhat  spicy,very concentrated in the glass,velvet in the mouth a reflection of the nose, I wouldn't give this wine its age in blind tasting for sure! !A very persistent ending, perhaps what stands out most is just that!Clearly a wine made to last,a flag to Portuguese wine making👏👏👏👏👏"
10719,75975,"Amazing experience to have this 24 year old mate tasting so rich and flavorous. My first time trying such a prestigious (and expensive) wine but it was worth it. It took a while for the nose to show some earthy scents. On the glass, characteristics of an old lady on the color and thick viscosity. The wine itself still had some fruits and a bit of  toasted almond (!!!) "
10720,75975,"Also had this by the glass at the Garrafeira Nacional in Lisbon. Like the Vega-Sicilia, this is also more than special. Complex and intense nose of toasty oak, cherries, sugar kane, spices, grass and herbaceous notes. Great body on it, smooth and elegant. And a great twist on the palate. The sweet and spice tones suggested by the nose, subtly turn exquisitely savoury on the palate with some bitter vegetal notes. Very different than the Vega, but a magnificent wine nonetheless."
10721,75975,"Intense ruby color. Intense and complex bouquet of blackberries, plum, mint, pine tree, chocolate, toasted almond, leather and eucalyptus. So many different aromas at different times of the tasting, great evolution on the glass. The attack on the mouth is fresh and sharpe, the balance is very good, present acidity and sharp medium tannins. If this was a blind tasting, I would have never guessed it was 24 years old, still so fresh!"
10722,75975,"Intense in a very elegant and harmonious way. On the nose it displays complexity with red fruits, toasted almonds, orange, spices and mint. Prolonged end. Highly recommended 100000 times better than Pêra Manca!"
10723,75975,"Ruby red. Soft fragrance of cool berrys, forrest, earth and mature wine. Earthy tastes with hints of vanilla and herbs. Long aftertaste, rounded tannins. Perfect with the steak. Comparable to a mature high-class Bordeaux.  Still the best wine in the world for me."
10724,75975,"Deep ruby color with garnet rim reflections. Expressive and elegant notes of jam black fruit mixed with subtle aromas of leather, earthy, balsamic, forest floor and lovely aromas of dried violet, eucalyptus, prunes, smoke, tobacco and clove. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. Full bodied, balanced, good acidity and long luxurious finish."
10725,75975,"Bright red, deep and very intense hue. The prevaling aromas are those of very ripe fruit - blackberry, plum, cassis, flowers - violet, spices-vanilla, pepper, balsam-cedar.On the palate it has an exellent balance between alcohol and acidity and it has a lingering, fine, elegant and delicate finish."
10726,75975,"This 1995 sample was superb! It was almost at the peak of aging, showing a delightful balance of all the elements that composes a Great Wine! It certainly can last several years more, without risk of deteriorating...a taste to remember for a long time!"

10734,1884612,Beautifully soft to drink with certainly a sense of Vanilla. I’ve not had much of this grape before and so was glad we tried this one. Paired with my favorite BBQ dishes.
10735,1884612,"I’ve not tasted Petit Verdot as a single varietal wine before. And I wouldn’t have expected it to be Portuguese. But what better place to grow this grape than in the beautiful furnace of the Douro Valley. Produced by the great Quinta Da Romaneira, this is a banker.   Heavy laden with black cherry and plum. Firm but rounded tannins, concentrated but not overripe, it has superb balance for such a big, rich wine. With a long, sumptuous baked fruit finish that goes on and on. Delicious 🇵🇹 ⭐️"

10739,1884612,"Very fruity and elegant Syrah. Fragrant stewed fruits on the nose. Smooth palate of plums, dark cherries, hints of chocolate. I expected something bold and powerful. It does have noticeable alcohol, but still feels quite soft, with polished tannins.  Like the Romaneira Petit Verdot - I enjoyed it but wouldn’t pay €20 for it again. There are plenty of cheaper options that provide the same level of enjoyment."

I love this grape and it's not easy to find great wines 100% PV.  Deep purple in color with forest fruits aromas and cassis notes. On palate is smooth and rich with fruity tannins and flavors of blueberries, ginger and cedar. Finished fruity and very persistent."

10747,1884612,"Medium body, firm tannins. Plums with vegetal notes. Impressive wine "
10748,13303,"Medium ruby colour with medium intensity of aromas on the nose.  Red and black berries, blackberries.  Full body, nice sweetness and great acidity with a very nice lasting finish."
10749,13303,"Deep ruby bit with a redness. Aromas of stewed rhubarb, blueberries, blackberries and black currant. Drinking perfectly now could do with a few years or decanting lots of fruit but great complexity and length- fabulous "
10750,13303,Caramel. Some shy citrus. Fantastic deep pleasant aftertaste.  
10751,13303,Smooth and interesting. high amount of sediment which was a bit fiddly to deal with in half bottle

10756,13303,Nice purple colour turning into red. Intensive forest fruits. Probably good with medium strong cheese.

Quite a heavy tannin still but ripe and focused. Powerful long minty finish with more vegetal component than other vintage port but overall quite good"
10758,13303,"One of the highlights of an excellent day in Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Tasted at Ramos Pinto. They were bought by Roederer in 1990, and now have a slick visitor centre on the Gaia waterfront.  Tawny rim, still deeply coloured in the centre of the glass. Gorgeous aroma, mostly tertiary, leather, chocolate, beef stock, tobacco, dark caramel. There’s just a bit of raisin and prune fruit, this is rather mature. Very sweet. Molasses, vanilla, delicately spiced. Silky smooth and very long. Great... drink up! "
10759,13303,Fortified wine class. Smokey cherry and chocolate. Attack is very sweet but let it hang out for bit. The tannins are gorgeous. Great finish. 
10760,13303,"Excellent, tight fruit, really fresh."
10761,13303,"This is a amazing bottle. Kept it for 18 years in the cellar. Worth every penny, and Best port experience for a long time."
10762,13303,"Super concentrated red fruit, raisins, berry jam, vanilla, oak. Viscous wine with plenty of alcohol. It needed a little more acidity in order to become perfect. "
10763,7656095,Oh god I love this man’s wines. This is a joint venture with his sister in the Douro. It’s fabulous but nothing like the price shown on Vivino! 
10764,7656095,"deep red, raspberry, chocolate, vanilla"
10765,7656095,Touriga Nacional and Sousao. Dark color and taste of black cherries due to the  25 % sousao. Still a bit estringente tannins so could do with a few more years to soften. Aroma strong to start but weakens quickly. A faint smell of black tea.
10766,7656095,Dark ink colour. Fruity but a bit on the acidic side. 
10767,7656095,"Would probably benefit from some time to rest in the bottle, but this is a luscious Douro, full of dark fruits and a well-balanced acidity. Buckets of flavour and a very long finish. "

10782,7656095,"deep red, raspberry, chocolate, vanilla"
10783,7656095,Touriga Nacional and Sousao. Dark color and taste of black cherries due to the  25 % sousao. Still a bit estringente tannins so could do with a few more years to soften. Aroma strong to start but weakens quickly. A faint smell of black tea.
10784,7656095,Dark ink colour. Fruity but a bit on the acidic side. 
10785,7656095,"Would probably benefit from some time to rest in the bottle, but this is a luscious Douro, full of dark fruits and a well-balanced acidity. Buckets of flavour and a very long finish. "

10824,1146296,"Strong purple color, full bodied, fruity aroma, equilibrated acid and alcoholic levels, high tannin and long ending. Woody, cherry, coffee and black berry tasting notes. It aged 1 year in barrique, good structure."
10825,1146296,"What a beauty... nose of sugar syrup, nuts , rosemary and incredible chocolate. Palate of creamy chocolate and raspberry with strong herbal components. Really high acidity and firm tannins. The greatest about this wine is it’s long finish.. really good Portuguese."
10826,1146296,"This wine crafted of a predominant cut of Trincadeira, Alicante Bouschet and Aragonês, aged for 12 months in French Allier oak barrels, presents a lively dense garnet color, notes of fresh fruit, light compote, well placed alongside notes of vanilla, elegant roasted that doesn’t overlap the fruit, pinch of spices. At the tongue is full body, the flavor is soft, balanced and refined structure, ripe fruit with some spice and evident tannins. Long and persistent finish. Great wine. "
10827,1146296,Encorpado e expressivo!
10828,1146296,What to say about a wine so rich in flavor and structure? The deep purple revels the high concentration of tannins. Well balanced and not so much acid perhaps because it’s stayed for 12 months in oak. Very good for commemoration. 
10829,1146296,Recommended at Adega do alantejo in Evora. Will accompany a traditional black boar. Intense garnet colour with blackberries and plums with a hint of vanilla. 
10830,1146296,"Lots of tannin, good red that will only improve. Great with the BBQ meat"

10833,1146296,Wine Weekend 2018..
10834,1146296,...a treasure from portugal...
10835,1146296,Great wine!!! Loved it
10836,1146296,"Dark fruits, cherry and Black berries. Purpur colour, firm tannine and medium acidity, Decent but too much oak. Had it with grilled Black pig, worked very well"
10837,1614920,"Deep tobacco, and licorice still with notes of flowers. Like it👍"
10838,1614920,Amazing for such a young port
10839,1614920,Very young. Not like a tawny yet. 
10840,1614920,"Vanilla, red berries, fig, wood, cherry and bitter blackberry.  Fig, ripe black cherry, white raisin,  Medium sweetness. Vanilla, blackberry. Fine balance. Still pretty fruity but very ripe and rounded. Long sweet and fruity finish. Excellent. 92"
10841,1614920,"Nice port, sweet berrys and owerall a good harmoni"
10842,1614920,"Fig, raisin, sour cherry, vanilla, nice tannins, well rounded not that crazy sweet, not that alcohol powered, very enjoyable! "
10843,1614920,Impressive fruit. Heavy and concentrated enough for almost anything. Or even more ageing...
10844,1614920,This did not really hit the spot for me. Seems a bit sharp and has a punch to it. Alcohol is too sharp for my likings. Maybe it has been opened for too long - however this was not my bottle so I am not sure if this has damaged the wine to some extent. Figs with raisin and some fruit but also pepper.
10845,1614920,"[DOC Dinner 4/4] 2️⃣ desserts 🤗😋 so I need a good size glass of port! My 1st from this house & of a nice age so expectations were high. With my nose in the glass they are met with warm intensity, ripe prune, some strawberry, oak and rhubarb. The ball is dropped somewhat in the palate though. The sweetness is kept well under control but more acidity to take advantage would be welcome because it’s a bit austere. Still stuff to discover: plum, overripe grapefruit, maple syrup, fig, chocolate and burnt notes. 3.7"
10846,1614920,"Nose of raisin, fig, brown sugar and tobacco. Flavors of prune, fig, raisin, plum, vanilla and tobacco.  A little ""hot"". Long finish of raisin and other dried fruit. Paired with a chocolate cake with raspberry drizzle "
10847,1614920,Almost mapley taste. Bada-bing cherry-like.
10848,1614920,"Fairly limited aromas of dark fruit, not too much spirit. Flavours of plums and raisins, but a bit limited. The tannins are subdued so the balance is good and the finish is longer than expected. All in all, moderate quality for a 17 year old vintage port, but none the less excellent vfm."
10849,1614920,"Beautiful port in the 2017 vintage, probably drank it way too early for such a good vintage but enjoyed it nonetheless  Figs and prunes but still with some fresh black fruit to balance it - winner!"
10850,1614920,Yes this is strong and a mouthful packs with strong dry fruit. It was very nice and good knockout element to it. 
10851,1099392,top wine. Love the blackforrest earthyness
10852,1099392,"Stunning floral-ish nose. Ripe, dark berries. Great intensity but still with freshness. Liquorice and mokka finish. Not overly sweet. Gorgeous!"
10853,1099392,"dark plum,and spice cherry with fresh acidity. chocolate finish. complex and powerful."
10854,1099392,Purple hazy lemonade. Very little nose interestingly. Maybe some dark berries and mud. A little imbalanced with too much sweetness and basically plain grape/concord flavors. Not nearly as complex as others have described.  2/19 update.  3 stars.  Smooth grape and cherry nose still w lemonade (weird).  Unctuous but not complex mouthfeel.  Balanced and fruity but not really deep or complex.
10855,1099392,"Very fruity, awesome port, one of the best i've had the pleasure to drink."
10856,1099392,"Nose: Light sweetness, freshness but also shallow in port scent. Mouth: Spiced, rough, edged. Alcohol. Sweet. Dies quick."
10857,1099392,Warm elegant bouquet 
10858,1099392,An amazing port!
10859,1099392,"Awesome purple hue. The nose is powerful on dark cherry, dried fruits. The tannins are soft and chewy, with many layers coating the palate. The finish is long and smooth. This port is drinkable now."
10860,1099392,"A wonderful serie of 8 toplevel vintage ruby ports of this fine producer this weekend. Even now ten years old this yougest in the lineup was bursting with powerful layered black forrest fruit and alcohol integrated into the wine. Deep lengthy flavours. A wine that can age much longer. @Wakende Haan, Abcoude. Top vintage year see link below."
10861,1099392,"An impressive vintage for this port house. Tasted a bit too young. Wine opens up with an intense aroma of fresh cut sweat berries with hints of jam. The palate is quite luscious, lots of fruit, some earthy notes and subdued tannins. A vintage port that will age for many years."
10862,1099392,"Placeholder  4.65/4.7 feels right Revised to 4.85. Absolutely exceptional. Sweet, but pleasantly so."
10863,1099392,Very vibrant still. Would not describe this as soft bit the flavours are awesome. Black fruit all over and many layers. A real complex port that makes me happy.
10864,1099392,Best vintage port ever !!!
10865,1099392,"Deep purple red.  Dark berries, mint, eucalyptus, dark chocolate. Bold, balanced. Med acidity. BlackBerry, chocolate. Hintt of tobacco. "
10866,8971,"The oldest wine I have ever tasted. Outstanding Porto! At 18/sep/2020. Thanks again, Di!"
10867,8971,"Look at what we are buying, a 1912 port, so excited "
10868,8971,Great full bodyv- best port!
10869,8971,"No wonders, my vintage so a good one - a wine with great freshness, nice and opulent oak touch, intense acidity delicious toffee caramel hints"
10870,8971,"Caramel, toasted honey, white chocolate, almond, walnut, pistacho, toffee, pungent on the nose. Well balanced alcohol upholding the natural sweetness of the wine. This is balanced with a coffee bitterness of the long and juicy finish. "
10871,8971,"93/100 Wonderful Tawny Port. Notes of honey, toffee, coffee, dried apricot, and almonds. Full and silky in bodied with high acidity and a long creamy finish. Great value for money as far as Ports go."
10872,8971,"Excellent - blackcurrant, chocolate and leather - not too sweet"
10873,8971,"20.5%. Opened on New Years. Very nice. Enjoyed over the past few evenings with a variety of holiday goodies. Paired well with mince pie, fruitcake, goat cheese (a surprise) Dubliner Cheese, and peppermint gum drops. Cheers."
10874,8971,"Niepoort, wow. The 2020 bottling of this 2007 Colheita, and it's psychedelic. Pale tawny. Loads of spicy wood on the nose, orange peel, maraschino cherry. The palate is 11/10 intensity, a punch in the face as much as a slap on the back. Mainlining black fruit, clove, raisin, caramel. The 19.5% ABV is lost in the eye of the storm. Niepoort are just showing off here really... but hell, I'm buying some more. I expect the 2050 bottling will be even better; I hope I'm around to try it. "
10875,8971,"Trivia: does anyone knows the difference between tawny, ruby, colheita, garrafeira, vintage, crusted, single quinta, lbv? And your favorite?  Great dinner in Alabaster restaurant in Madrid, from Galicia, finished with a colheita Porto.  Brownish tawny color, mid intensity. Nose is very nutty with aromas of dry fruit like figs.Sweet and mineral attack, fullbody sensantion,pleasant and frank palate that stays for long time. Great dinner and great Porto:)"
10876,8971,"In my opinion Niepoort makes some of the best ports, that maintain to be incredibly fruit forward, even at astonishing old ages.  This is just another great example of this. Tasted up against 1968, and it was hard to say which one was better. This had a more vinous feel to it, with notes of blackberry crumble, cigar box, chewy dark chocolate, salt caramel, cassis, black cherries and fruitcake. Needles to say both were fantastic. "
10877,8971,"(1980 Colheita)  Upfront forward nose. Elegant smell of raisin, figs and nuts. Velvet Soft mouthfeel. Sweet Vanilla flavours and apricot/fig/date  and a mouthwatering sensation. Astonishing lively at the age of 35 years. Lovely balanced. (was lucky to find at a restaurant serving it at 5 EUR by the glass.) Mega bargin.... Great Long after taste."
10878,8971,"Amber colors, oak, licorice and coffee aromas, hints of fig but not as fruity as one might expect. Some tannins and a subtle acidity."
10879,8971,"Beautiful, deep glowing amber. Figs, orange peel, hazelnuts, almonds, butter, old wooden floors... Concentrated, graceful and long. Lovely!"
10880,8971,Hazelnut note with a rich ripe fruit on the palate.  Balance of sweetness and fruit.  On another level compared to most other ports 
10881,1183111,"As a Reserva, nothing surprising with the smell: woody notes jump at you. In the palate the blueberries take over and give this wine a smooth finish and a medium aftertaste. Good bang for the bucks"
10882,1183111,"Big nose here, black fruit, plum, vanilla and a little almond. Lovely mouthfeel, quite acidic and with a little grip from some tannin. Very good stuff"
10883,1183111,"A star that is a bit on the expensive side but true winemaking skills exhibited. The reserva means oak, Dark fruit and leather but also a first  easy kiss on tongue. "
10884,1183111,"Fresh, aromatic, a lot of acidity. Very nice"
10885,1183111,Nice wine from Portugal  Good moments to share with good friends  🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
10886,1183111,"Tasty notes of dark ripe berries, plums and oak,nice dry spicy palate."
10887,1183111,"Nose: muted plum, cherry, vanilla...classic red. Taste: dry, thick - makes my tongue feel furry. Would be great with steaks or a stew. "
10888,1183111,"Oakey aromas. Interesting notes of nutmeg and plum and wood. High acidity, gorgeous subtle tannins. 3.9"
10889,1183111,"Mais uma vez revisitado, mas esta safra estava a pedir guarda. Está mais equilibrado a demonstrar os aromas a fruta preta madura, na boca o chocolate especiado fruto do estágio na barrica, o final é persistente e longo. Cheers and Merry Christmas to all my vivino friends 🥂🍷"
10890,1183111,"A special one from Portugal, very delicious. Robust with fierce tannins, great nose with some herbal sense to it, and a dry feeling to be mouth on the aftertaste, i like it!!"
10891,1183111,"Good wine, balanced but somewhat boaring. Has tanins, short aftertaste but still leaves joy. "
10892,1183111,Nice Alentejo. Not as rich as expected but fruity and smooth with a nice finish
10893,1183111,"Monte Branco does it again. Fruit forward, bold, cherries, plum "
10894,1183111,"Spicy, provided with a faint smokiness, it shows beautiful batches of blackberry and cassis. The oak is perceived less as a single component, but in its mitigating function. The body flexible and compact, this is the grainy tannins and strong acidity, a slight bitterness offset by the dark fruit. The finish is intense."
10895,1183111, leather dense  dark fruit tobacco blueberry smoke
10896,94299,"Dark-brick red, full-bodied and very aromatic. Notes: mostly wooded notes (oak). Great pairing with roasted pork flanks."

10901,94299,Encorpado . Frutas vermelhas e madeira .   Strong body . Red fruit and wood 
10902,94299,"Medium purple coloured red wine.  Light intensity nose. Blackberry, black cherry. Smoke, cedar.   Dry, high acidity, high alcohol, full body, high tannins.  Could use more bottle time. Bit off balance.  Medium intensity palate. Less fruit on the palate than on the nose. Short finish, but lots of tannins left.  Enjoyed with salami, prosciutto and provolone charcuterie on a sunny afternoon!"
10903,94299,"Okay, not the best Douro.   tobacco blackberry "
10904,94299,Rich and awesome. Personally find it interesting with the roasted after taste. 
10905,94299,really smooth with the tapas for sure on the list for look outs can not go wrong
10906,94299,"Bold and smoky, rich with a little sweetness. Goes down well but not remarkable."

10921,4168768,"Lovely, delicious, and the best Vinha Maria wine series so far. Intense ruby with purple rims with predominant aromas of red cherry, strawberry jam, floral, and dried herbs. Almost full-bodied with delicious flavors of cherry, ripe & juicy Japanese strawberry, cranberry, and hint of spicy herbs such as Thai basil leaves. Dry with medium & very soft tannins, medium & just enough acidity, and juicy medium(+) aftertaste. Perfect to paired with grilled pork, grilled chicken, and cheese. Solid 4.25."

Wonderfull pairing with a medium rare filet steak."
10977,1189665,"Top bottle!  Certainly one of the best portuguese reds I had so far.  Beautifull and kind of „sensible“ aroma specteum in the nose.. mix of sweet spice, clove, wiff of vanilla and ripe red berries. Perfectly in balance and inviting as hell..  pretty much the same aromas on the palate. Smoothness par excellence.. ripeness of the fruit aromas to die for.. aroma extract! Every balanced as well..  time will add only extra character and additional flavors.  A certain future 5* candidate! "

10983,1189665,What just happened!? Portugal reds are officially on the map. Lil’ Wayne is his prime good vino
10984,1189665,All encompassing aromatics. It jumps out of the glass and wraps around your face.  The color is pretty. It has a long finish and very pleasant on the palate that shows different looks as it sits on your palate.
10985,1189665,"I liked this one the most however it comes at a heavy price. Very elegant wine with lots of depth in flavors ranging from ripe red fruit to balanced acidity and tannins to make it a complex wine. Everything matches perfectly together to create an equilibrium which pleases the palate to a full lengthy extend. High quality. €41 at the house,€86 in Belgium."
10986,1896436,"93/100 Blend of Sousão, Tinta Francisca, Rufete, Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional. Wonderful nose of mixed red fruit, mocha, cedar, and tangerine peel. Juicy and full-bodied with big, grippy tannins. Again the acidity of these Douro grapes wipes the palate clean. Long finish."

10991,1896436,So special to drink with best friends!
10992,1896436,"Great Douro - but not incredible. Somewhat still closed after 4hs breathing. Yes there’s chocolate, blackberry, leather, vanilla and spice but it feels underdeveloped now in Nov’2020 so would be interesting to have another go in a couple of years. However, the same vintage from Quinta da Leda, for instance, is already delivering (beautifully!) and for 20 bucks less. I’d recommend it whether money and waiting are not constraints for you."
10993,1896436,"Dark fruits on the nose, blackberries, blueberries, and plums. Some vanilla and resin. The wine is dry with high tannins, a full body and med minus acid. High alcohol. The flavors are pronounced of charred wood, blackberries, vanilla, cinnamon, and pie crust. Finish is long. The balance here is close to being on point. But it couldnrest for a bit and get better. "

10998,1896436,Very good one again from Cristiano. Raspberry Cherry red currant . Red fruits dominating here the vine. Decant minimum 1 hour
10999,1896436,Lots of red fruit and tobacco. This was a 2016 and it needs another 10 years in bottle 
11000,1896436,"Focused, concentrated and elegant, showing notes of ripe red fruit, tobacco, vanilla, cinnamon, clove and mineral. It will improve in the future. Top quality. "
11001,1216556,"Nicely crisp vinho verde - fresh citrus taste with hints of pear, apples and bit of mineral /sea salt aftertaste. Acidic = 4 Tannins = 1"

Very good wine for every occasion.  "
11009,1216556,"Minerality is strong - you can sense that even on the nose. Pear, apples and stone, very dry and crispy with medium acidity. The bottle is fancy too (although it’s too tall to stand in my fridge lol). A very special wine and especially great if you want to taste what minerality tastes like."
11010,1216556,"Recommended by the restaurant, the perfect pairing to the fresh Grouper. Enjoyed cold, the wine is super refreshing and crisp and shows a lot of minerality, 3,9⭐️. A bit restrained on the nose with notes of lemons and green apples. On the palate flavors of lemons, grapefruits and green apples. It becomes slightly creamy on the finish with a nice pear note."

11015,1216556,Vinhos de Portugal @ CasaShopping 02jun2019
11016,1246384,"One of the best producers of the region. 100% Loureiro, focused aromas and flavours of floral grapefruit, apple and honeyed lemon. Tight acid structure comes with surprising weight on the palate (at least for 12,5% abv). Long, refreshing finish. Perfectly accompanied a South indian, Garam Masala based fish dish. 3.8"
11017,1246384,"Brought from recent travel to Portugal and very pleased to try this great value from Vinho Verde, maybe the best producer in that region and not because of the common name;).  Deep lemon. Nose is clean, fresh and ripe all over, nice notes of apricot and general citrics. Dry attack, mineral touch, refreshing mid+acidity and nice alcohol sensation. Very well done alvarinho that may lack in concentration and complexity but great for the price! Would love to try the big ones from Anselmo! 0.5 for the value!!!"
11018,1246384,"Flinty on the nose, but wonderfully fresh and citrusy on the palate. Crisp green apples and under ripe peach, with a hint of kiwi fruit. "
11019,1246384,Probably the best vinho verde I’ve tasted so far. No reason to go more into characteristics about this as vinho verde is vinho verde...
11020,1246384,"Green citrus nose for this Vinho Verde which presents a mineral profile.  A lot of freshness, just a little bit too much acidity. 13,5 / 20."
11021,1246384,"Medium lemon, no sparkles, pronounced aroma. Peach, nectarines, green apple, grapefruit and lemon on the nose. Medium plus acidity alond with medium alcohol give medium minus body with rich palate. Long and refreshing finish."
11022,1246384,"Spritzy Albarinho-Loureiro-Avesso blend by Anselmo Mendes! While the two aformentioned gives structure and aromas, the Avesso provides minerality.  Four months on fine lees. Citrus, green apples and pears on the nose. Beesewax, wet gravel and melon on the palate. Crisp, fruity and totally in balance. "
11023,1246384,"90 points  PQR vinho Verde! Aromatic, and fresh with with a clean minerality and a nice finish. A lot more than I was expecting notes of citrus and melon, with wet stone and the right amount of acid to keep the wine balanced. Pairs well with the piquillo peppers! "
11024,1246384,"Lovely refreshing Vinho Verde from Anselmo Mendes, 100% Loureiro.  Lifted floral aroma, blossom, bay-leaf and grapefruit.  The palate combines lime and lemon citrus zip with the maritime minerality of the best Vinho Verde, full of sea spray and soft chalk.  High acidity, no spritz.  Serve with salads, seafood and soups.    Wine trivia: The name Loureiro means ""laurel"", and refers to the bay-leaf (Laurus nobilis) scent of Loureiro wines."
11025,1246384,Very nice mineral profile with slight chalky notes. Nice citrus notes with a great balance between fruit and acid.
11026,1246384,"floral, acidic, dry finish"
11027,1246384,"Lacking the spritz of my favourite vinho verdes, but still containing the typical acidity and youngness. Also more aromatic than most"

11029,1246384,Very nice and refreshing for the warm day. Will by again. Tip: serve at least at 6 C
11030,1246384,A very fresh and crisp vinho verde. Almost sauvignon blanc like in the aromtic grapefruit and green and floral character. Nice!
11031,1736466,"Rich nose like you can only find in a wine with some years under its belt. I can still smell it from the other side of the room! The palate is very mature with brown fruit, controlled acidity and still a surprising amount of wooden tannines. If you're in the area and quick, Chacalli in Antwerp is clearing their cellar fixing the QPR of this Grande Reserva."
11032,1736466,"Was still in good shape despite its age. Loads of cooked black fruit, blueberry, cinnamon and fig. Once you got through the fresh fruit outline, you could feel the prune and age qualities in the core. Palate rang through with a lot of black and cooked fruit tones. Tannins had rounded out, yet still medium in intensity. Acid was medium and still kicking. Yum!"
11033,1736466,Frankrig vs Portugal. The winner! Nice price.
11034,1736466,"Awesomeness in a bottle,this 2006 is in its apogee!A deep garnet color showing its age with a slight brown rim.The nose is great,delicious and inviting,great aromas of red ripe fruit,plum and cherries,spices and some smoke.Things get serious on the palate with a amazing picture of well integrated oak and ripe fruit ,spices and a silky smooth finish accompanied by acidity filling the palate in just the right amount.The end is long and yummy,marked by quality fruit and great persistence.Recommend for sure!"
11035,1736466,"Very high tannins, still has potential, very balanced, violets, perfume, black fruits"
11036,1736466,"Dark red wine with reflections between ruby ​​and purple. On the nose, field flowers, plums and cassis. In the mouth beautiful body, structure and balance between acidity and fruit. Striking tannins and long finish."
11037,1736466,"Was fortunate to taste this wine in the Douro Valley in Portugal at DOC restaurant. Loved it so much I bought a bottle. This wine is a mix of 3 grapes (Touriga Nacional, Tina Roriz & Tourica Franca). It has aromas of soft red fruits, very smooth round tannins with good balance of oak and acidity. Long 17 second finish. Taste with filet mignon. Epic!"
11038,1736466,"Evolved herby nose. The palate is quite elegant with dark red fruit, medium acidity and a spicy edge. Old fashioned. Very good wine."
11039,1736466,"Great stuff here. Mostly ripe black fruit, hints of ripe red cherry, well integrated new French oak, cocoa, sage and dry earth. Would be awesome with a good striploin.   Will benefit from more age but drinking very well now."
11040,1736466,Expected more but above avrg douro wine
11041,1736466,Strong but creamy. Interesting. Not so easy but very charming. Black fruits. Very rich and generous wine from Douro. The region is not only a region of Porto wines.
11042,1736466,"A lovely wine. Elegant aromas of dark berries and prunes, well rounded tannins and silky body with a gentle spice. The finish could have been a bit longer. "
11043,1736466,"Very powerful aromas of dark fruit, cherries and prunes good mid to full body with a sweet aftertaste.  Still tannic but with good breathing calms down"
11044,1736466,"Dark red, almost inky in colour with bold aromas of dark red fruits. Full-bodied but a bit tannic. The aftertaste is a bit short but overall an excellent wine."
11045,1736466,Mmm...yum! Great wine from Portugal. Fruity and smells strongly 3 inches from the glass! Very smooth and tasty. Will buy more for sure. Great discovery.
11046,2117860,"One of the most refreshing wines I’ve ever tasted. Reminds me of a great Gavi or top dry Chenin Blanc. Portugal is on the move. Wine by the bottle, "
11047,2117860,"Very traditionally made wine. Indigenous grape varieties. Foot pressing. Full bodied old fashion style, soft lush fruit, oily, some length. Will not be to everyone’s taste but well done!"
11048,2117860,"Wonderful, you're kidding about the price?"
11049,2117860,"Pleasantly sweet, well balanced, smooth - great mouth feel"
11050,2117860,"Nice Southern Portuguese white; this blend of Antão Vaz, Arinto, PX and Fernão Pires offers a friendly nose with hints of apples and herbs and floral impressions.  At first sip fresh acidity. A tingling sensation on the tongue. Delicate flavors of apple and herbs. Balanced and a med+ finish. Good. 14 pts @ Art of wines"
11051,2117860,Fresh with intense lemon and grapefruit. The mineral texture gives the wine its refreshing zing while the fine fruitiness means the wine is really ready to drink when young
11052,2117860,"Very interesting to try this! Português white blend from secret cellar   Loads of peach, stone fruits, floral elements, and cream on the nose  Pallate is fresh, but rich and full bodied, with bags of minerals and herbs on the finish, before that it's heavy on the fruit from the nose. Good finish for this price point too!   I like this for £13!"
11053,2117860,"3.75🌟 👃Zesty lemon and slightly floral, grassy notes  👅 Citrus zippiness and pleasant acidity but with some unripe pineapple coming in to play to. The finish was surprisingly creamy and balanced out that acidity nicely"

11063,1268175,Nice rounded syrah. Unusual for the alentejo. Would pair well with cheese and winter stews
11064,1268175,"Really, Syrah must be more aged. This one it’s like lemon acid instead of orange juice on your breakfast. But... it’s still a wine!"
11065,1268175,"Well balanced, good."
11066,1268175,"Slightly astringent, lemon tea and green strawberry notes with chalky tannin. Mid body, slightly lack luster Syrah . "

11082,1269166,"Say hello to this Portuguese powerhouse with royal blood from the Douro region. It’s a blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz according to the label. Ruby colour with lots of medium legs. 18 months of oak layering leads to scents and flavours of oak, smoke and vanilla. Lots of red fruit and black fruit too. Also present: dried fruit, eucalyptus, mint and cinnamon. Medium+ finish with a peppery feel. Silky tannins. Great value. They’ve renovated the old farm to a beautiful quinta nova."
11083,1269166,"3.8  This Reserva is made from Touriga Naçional, Touriga Franca, Tinto Rori and Tinta Barocca.   Med+ body with a bit of freshness.  Ripe plum, cherry, raisins, eucalyptus, cinnamon spice, fig.  Small bitter, lush mouth fee, fine tannins in the background. "
11084,1269166,"Beautiful wine with aromas of fresh (not cooked) black fruit (blackberries, blueberries, cassis), soft roasted spices,  vanilla and cedar. Delightful pallet, medium-bodied, balanced with finesse. There is a moderated sence of wood."
11085,1269166,Soft yet complex with lovely fruit flavours and spice. Soft enough for roast chicken dishes
11086,1269166,"First ever porto / duoro white wine.  Smooth, easy, delicious with minerals and as if there is citrus peels in it. Like it."
11087,1269166,"Complex, rich flavours, dark fruits, minerals, unusual touriga. It lacks body and could have more defined personality "
11088,1269166,Deep purple. Very young appearance. Viscous.  Reserved nose. Red fruit.  Medium full attack. Well structured. Very little tannin. Strong finish. Some length.  A good Douro.  Tasted in Lisbon.
11089,1269166,"WHITE NOT RED!! Drank too warm, probably didn’t do much justice. Mineral complex nose, smooth body, lean, with nice mineral touch and ripen melon. Medium king elegant finish. 88"
11090,1269166,Big flavour; dark fruit; minerals; a bit earthy; complex nose
11091,1200518,"It's a wonderful time to be a wine lover, tasting the journeys of passionate winemakers as they revive and refresh their local wines. Anselmo Mendes grew up in Monção, and is now one of vinho verde's champions. This Monção and Melgaço Alvarinho is a synergy of skilled winemaking, localism and terroir. Mineral aroma, ripe peach, melon, lime zest and orange peel, jasmine, lily. The palate is just off dry, with a slight spritz. Peach and minerals, crushed gravel, sea-spray and chalk. Light, refreshing. 3.75*."
11092,1200518,"Citruses, tropical fruits, mineral notes, quite long finish. Med body with good acidity. Sustainable during conversion to organic."
11093,1200518,"AIS-89 To be paired with a Puros de Hostos Académico Corona, Robusto o Belicoso. Nicely harmonious & balanced. ¡Enjoy &  Salud!"
11094,1200518,"If you can judge a wine by the sadness you feel when it is finished then this is a winner. It is fresh, clean and floral but also rounded with a lovely finish. 😢"
11095,1200518,"Pale yellow, golden hues, floral, tropical nose, delicate and refined palate, passion fruit and mineral backbone, very nicely structured and balanced. A gem! "
11096,1200518,"Light golden yellow. Nose fresh citrus, peach, pear and melon as it warms. Strong acidity, fresh and pleasant. Good finish and balanced. Enjoyed with a soft white fish, stunning. "
11097,1200518,"First night in Porto, Portugal.  Very nice bright, crisp, young wine. Notes of citrus, melon, tart & a lingering citrus finish. Cheers to an exciting vacation with lots of new wine!"
11098,1200518,"As usual a good wine from Anselmo Mendes.  Being made from grapes from old vines, this one has slightly more complex aromas of minerals when  compared to his entry level Alvarinho."
11099,1200518,"Another VV showing very well, very citric and mineral. Great vintage for top producers in this amazing region and particularly for Alvarinho. This one shows it all, great edition"
11100,1200518,Another belter from Anselmo Floral on the nose with white peach and lime also evident The palate is full and quite rich but with a wonderful freshness on the finish and bags of energy 
11101,1200518,"Albariño tasting #1: Lieven wanted us to taste this ‘entry level’ and later the Top end from the same producer.  Granite soil coming from 2 vineyards - 6M sur Lees.  Wet Stone, Mandarines on Sirop, Pear, White Flowers.  Great balance with quite surprising creamy taste in the mix with super acidity & Mineral touch. "
11102,1200518,"A nice wine, but not quite what I expected. Light yellow hue, apple and melon on the nose which dominate the taste. Nice acidity more round and full than anticipated, without the VV spritz. A good aperitif or light dish white though."
11103,1200518,"A great value Portuguese white wine from the local Alvarinho grape variety. Oak-free, fresh, floral and mineral. Quite round, rich and balanced with good acidity. We had it after a couple of expensive GVs and Rieslings and it was on par with them."
11104,1200518,"The white I’ve bought to go with Eurovision - having tasted it I’m sad I’ve opted to drink the red. Really crisp and light, floral notes and green fruit on the nose. The finish gives you a bit of soft peach. "
11105,1200518,"Albariño tasting # 1 It offers Inviting aromatics and high - volume freshness in the nose, supported by citrus peel, ripe pear, gooseberry and lichy, along with wet gravel.  This wine overdelivers a nice racy line of acidity because of his youtness with pleasing green apple, pear, and white flowers dry out and suggests mandarin syrup on the finish. Let it age for a few years and become a masterpiece. Anselmo Mendes has been the leading winemaker in the North of Portugal for years. Top value!  4.0 🌟"
11106,1240414,"Quite good with very polished savory fruit, very drinkable and balanced. Not so seductive on the palate, specifically the finish, otherwise this would be a great wine. But it is very good..."
11107,1240414,Great wine tks Malhadinha for this Touriga Nacional 
11108,1240414,I really need to explore Portugal more. This is delightful.
11109,1240414,Juicy. No sign of the usual ripeness.
11110,1240414,Great Herdade da Malhadinha Nova wine tasting session! Intense ruby red color with thin violet rim. Fresh floral nose with red and black fruits aroma. Structured but elegant with ripe tannins and oak well integrated aromas. Fine cigar box hints. Long fresh and silky finish. Too young but with an excellent aging potencial. See you in few years.
11111,1240414,"Delicious and full of fragrance, love it!"
11112,1240414,"Very young. Now it is still gaseous, sharp, acidic and bitter. Maybe in 2017-18 it will be better."
11113,1240414,"Black fruits, excellent tanin from Portuguese premium grape variety"
11114,1240414,"Fruité, long, structuré Excellentissime "
11115,1240414,Bit one dimensional and hot. 
11116,1240414,"Smooth blackberry and raspberry fruits, v subtle hint of spice (anise maybe?). Age has mellowed it but it’s still drinking well."
11117,1240414,"Great. Strong, juicy, fresh. Bought from the Malhadinha winery in Portugal after a wine tour / tasting (also a fantastic restaurant)."
11118,1240414,Nice but heavy
11119,1240414,"Well made and you don’t notice the 15 degrees of alcohol.  Deep, opaque red slightly lighter at the rim.  Rich legs that cling to the glass. Perfumed. Long and broad in the mouth, although tannins present and slightly drying. Cherries and bubblegum in the mouth. 8 years old now - maybe just past it’s best???"
11120,1240414,"A really enjoyable oak-aged VR Alentejano Touriga Nacional, this is very good indeed, a great example of what Alentejo is capable of.  Med ruby. Plump, ripe & soft w. black & red cherry, blueberry, crème de mure, elderberry & creamy vanillin. Well-integrated oak spice, violet floral notes, garrigue & anise. Developing.  Dry. M+ alc, high acid & m+ ripe tannins. Robust w. black cherry, blackcurrant, blackberry & damson. The m+ finish is well done, ripe & well fruited w. a complex note of leafy cured meat."
11121,1199799,"Not bad per se, just too blend. Has all the characteristics a good full bodied Oakes wine should have, but feels like a weaker, severely watered down version of it."
11122,1199799,"A sultry sour lemon sashaying in sunshine, fresh black pepper greens against springy garden greens not yet in bloom."
11123,1199799,"Dark lemon color, little acidity, mid-bodied. Okayish."
11124,1199799,"Nice grape variety, complex on the nose but  too diluted on the mouth, bit short. 12/20.  "
11125,1199799,"Fruity (citrus), dry (but creamy aftertaste) some minerals and nice tannines. Medium long finish. Good value wine (you should be able to get this for max 10 euros)"
11126,1199799,Oak and freshness
11127,1199799,Vigo: really smooth but not a fruity aftertaste that we like from white wines. BUT it’s quality stuff and would drink a bottle for a change
11128,1199799,"Strong wine, quite some tannine. Dark red, fruity flavor. Rises to the nose."
11129,1199799,"The Portuguese seem to be all about value in their wine. This one hits the mark quite well. Bottle was only slightly chilled - perfect. Not much nose, but a really nicely balanced palate with a touch of citrus that unfolds on your tongue with sip. The right amount of acid.   Served with Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Sushi rolls. Killer combo. I just might take a detour from sake next time I go to my favorite sushi restaurant at home providing I can find this in the states."
11130,1199799,"Encruzado grape from the Dão region. excellent taste mixing freshness and complexity with a smooth long finish. Absolutely phenomenal with a lobster or octopus salad, or any seafood for that matter"
11131,1199799,"Dry, with good quality considering the price."
11132,1199799,"Fresh, nice depth, oaky aftertaste, underrated on Vivino"
11133,1199799,"What a stunner! Encruzado, the underrepresented Chardonnay doppelgänger. What sets this grape apart is the balanced combination between a high acidity and an oaky butteriness. Funky finish. Will be drinking next summer!"
11134,1199799,"What a night it was, looking for food & wine during Lisbon's overly crowded old town alleys. Bright red, simple, fruity and tasty. Goes well with fine Pizza at 2am."
11135,1199799,"A tainted green Portuguese Encruzado from Dao with a discreet nose with prevailing notes of oak. Short bodied, with reasonable acidity but not too rich in flavours. "
11136,20891,"Very rich wine with a lot of nuances. Toffee, dried currants burnt sugar, there is big pleasant tension between the acidity and sugar. There is so much going on here that it makes you work a lot."
11137,20891,This shit is the fucking paraiso in fluid....🤪
11138,20891,Perfect taste and just the right amount of sweetness and warmth.  Delicious!
11139,20891,What is it? No wine with 18% but very tasty. 
11140,20891,Very special moscatel with complex structure and great aftertaste
11141,20891,"Excellent strong dessert wine! Cognac colour, moderated fruity aromas on the nose, balanced acids, full-bodied, long after-tasted."
11142,20891,"Syrah around the world wine dinner, Mestiço Vila Nova Conceição restaurant, October 28.  Dry fruits, almonds, apricot, good balance.  Rate 4.3"
11143,20891,"Classic 5 year old example Muscatel de Setubal. Rich & complex with gorgeous nuances of honey, nuts & caramelized sugar. Enjoyed immensely with red velvet cake."
11144,20891,"Wow. Best moscatel ever. Full bodied, rich and complex. Never thought a dessert wine could be. Smells like honey with nuts. Taste of honey, caramel and cognac. Amazing!"
11145,20891,"Orange zest, orange, caramel, nutty, raisins, fig, honey.   🗺 Region: Peninsula de Setubal, Portugal 🇵🇹 🍇 Grapes: Mocsatel roxo ⌚️ Vintage: 2004 Moscatel 🏰 Winery: Bacalhoa"
11146,20891,"Aroma and intense flavours of orange blossom, citrus, bitter orange marmalade, dried apricots, raisins, figs and nuts, a full palate and excellent balance between sweetness and acidity."
11147,20891,"Now this bottle really got my attention last weekend. Another treat from @[1|2108048|Frederic Knockaert] (keep up the good work 😀). It showed the usual aroma's and flavours you can expect, but combined with a high concentration and everlasting finish.  This was great!  Cheers everybody. "
11148,20891,"Portugese fortified wine is always a good option to wrap up a wine exploration evening amongst friends. I consider myself a kind of ambassador of Portuguese wine so I feel the responsibility to ‘educate’ my friends. This is a great value Moscatel de Setubal from the more rare Moscatel Roxo grape.  Delicious nose with orange (zest, flesh & peel), nuts, apricot, fig, cinnamon and beeswax followed by a palate with beautiful acidity, yummy sweetness, grapefruit, orange and nuts into the nice finish. 4.3"
11149,20891,"I really liked this moscatel wine. citrus aroma with floral nuances. in the mouth it is sweet, predominating the candied orange and the almond. Long and very pleasant ending. Ideal to accompany Portuguese conventual desserts."
11150,20891,"Old, complex and intense. Rich aroma, floral notes of orange blossom, raisins, almonds, figs and honey, lot of honey. Sweet, but very well balanced, with vivid acidity. Um vinho pra lembrar Portugal e sentir saudade..."

11152,1765890, raisin caramel orange
11153,1765890,"Sweet, lovely honey edge "
11154,1765890,"Raisin, alcohol, orange, cinnamon"
11155,1765890,"Notes of raisin (!!), caramel and orange. Sweet af. All sounds good in theory but to reduce the risk of having a seriously uncomfortable sugar kick, drink only a glass of it, maybe half a glass."
11156,1765890,"3.75. I really like the intensity of the Moscatel de Setúbal. This one delivers guava, caramel and spices hints. Unctuous, sweet, with good acidity. "
11157,1765890,"🇵🇹 Exelente moscatel da Bacalhôa, uma cor âmbar escuro, nariz com laranja, mel e caramelo, boca corpo médio, intenso, untuoso com equilíbrio entre doçura e álcool, ótima acidez com taninos redondos o final é longo e persistente.  🇬🇧 Excellent muscatel from Bacalhôa, a dark amber color, nose with orange, honey and caramel, mouth medium body, intense, unctuous with balance between sweetness and alcohol, great acidity with round tannins the finish is long and persistent."
11158,1765890,"Interesting fortified wine. 17% alcohol. Reminds me a lot Madeira wines that we tried on Madeira. Not extremely sweet, but surely sweet it was. raisin orange caramel citrus honey dried apricot. If you like this style, you will love this wine. Cheers 😘"
11159,1765890,"It reminds me Madera (island and wine 😁). Very sweet- true, but with nice notes of dried fruits (raisins, apricot, dates), orange peel (not too much). Fantastic finish of pleasant evening with friends. Thank you, @[1|24835435|Andrew Bihun]!! Cheers!!"
11160,1765890,"Orange, citrus, dried fruits, citrus zest, round vanilla. Cream. Round and zesty smell and flavours that surprised me in ‘freshness’ rather than thickness with regard to dessert wine "
11161,1765890,"REALLY tasty. Surprisingly good! If We weren’t driving, would drink more! Inexpensive locally, would sell for much more in U.K. sweet without being too rich or syrupy."
11162,1765890,"Interesting rubber and petrol notes in the bouquet, but after 15 minutes of breathing opened up beautifully and the palate was very floral."
11163,1765890,Never fails. Honey  appricot and Lemon. 
11164,1765890,Delicious desert wine. Perfect with apple crumble
11165,1765890,Drank this at my wedding 2015 and it was great to the desert. 
11166,1467162,9/2/21 Churchill’s Estate wine tasting - Alex had blackberry and blueberry … Catherine got almond and oak along with red fruit - delicious and finishes with tannins taking over

11172,1467162,"Thouroghly enjoyed this wine. Earth and pepper on the nose (so much more though after a few hours), in the mouth it shows its elegance and finesse with silky smooth tannins, good acidity. Chocolate and coffee notes with a very long finish and licorice after taste. Hope to get another one to share with some friends."
11173,1467162,Has had its days. Still drinkable but showing lack of vibrance and turned into a very light style that misses complexity and grip. Is on its way down but was once a good wine clearly 
11174,1467162,"Awesome, complex and dry. Very good"
11175,1467162,"Churchill is a  Portuguese Producer best known here in Brasil by its Portos which are very good, at least one or two I v tried.  This is his top dryred comming from GrandCru importer. In a tasting I v had oportunity to try it saturday.  Well very good Douro red in a great vintage but a bit too expensive for what delivers.  Cheers!!"
11176,1467162,"4.2. Magnificent Douro from this great producer. Deep purple in color with moderately heavy tears and light staining on the glass. Fairly heavy amount of particles even after filtering. On the nose are aromas of blackberry, blueberry, red fruits, pepper, spice, and a slight floral element. The palate shows flavors of dark berries, plum, cigar box, tar, and pepper. Full-bodied with medium acidity, medium tannins, and a long finish."

11189,1988305,"3,4⭐ The entry level red from São Domingos. 👀Light ruby.  👃Soft with ripe blackberry, bay leaf and oak. 👅Oak, earthy and cedar notes. Medium-light body with sharp yet not too strong tannins, which give it some character.  🗒️It has an unusual bouquet of aromas (for me at least). Improved from 2014 one, enough to reach half a star up. "
11190,1988305,Like it a lot.  Smooth and just a nice blend
11191,1988305,"Blackberry, bay leaf, spice, light violet notes. Better on day 2: raspberry and floral notes coming out."
11192,1988305,"Small sparkling wild berries, wet bitter wood, crisp flowers. Simple, in a way, but still so well balanced Bairrada economy red. Exceptional QPR value, really!   "

11206,1155012,"Maybe the white that most surprised and pleased me.  ( Porto & Douro Wine Tasting Event )  Bright citrus colour and a fantastic, surprising, complex and elegantly well-made aroma.  We can find citrus, floral, butter and a touch of oak tying all flavors in a unique and surprisingly bouquet. Never tasted something like it before.  Palate is not different. Elegant, harmonious, balanced, fresh, mineral, buttery and some almond surrounded by a vibrant acidity leading to a tasty, striking and persistent finish."

11220,76110,"Splendid red from Dão! Only produced in exceptional years, this is a rich blend of mainly T. Nacional (88%), Alfrocheiro (6%) and a field blend (6%), aged 18m in French oak barrels. Bold, deep and complex, with juicy acidity and great length. Deep purple color, floral, ripe dark fruits aromas/flavors, specially black currant and plum, with notes of cassis, pepper, spices, mint,  and well integrated oak. Full body, polished tannins and a long tasty finish. Great red, very gastronomic and still growing!"
11221,76110,"From a tasting. Notes read: v good, concentrated, finesse - eucalyptus, cigars, juicy black fruit, plump, generous. Sadly a little forgettable. 4.1⭐️"
11222,76110,"Very impressive, bright ruby red. Complexity that develops in the glass with oak and plum notes. Unfortunately, only the very wealthy can afford this one.  4.1/5.0"

11230,76110,Best red on tour so far 
11231,76110,"A Very Powerful wine. Full of color, structure but very balanced and drinkable now. Will last a very long time but why wait... It's a bit too oaky at this stage and it's probably missing minerality to make it a 4,5 point wine, but very good"
11232,76110,"Ruby colour, in the nose the toast is evident, powerfull aroma of wild berries, almost makes you cough, some yougurt, raspberry and blueberry jam, and cloves. Some iron as well to give it some minerality. Taste extremly powerfull, with strong tannins, dark chocolate and cacau powder, ashes like a argentinian malbec, black pepper, but still with some wonderfull fruit. The oak is very well blended. Dry, high acidity, and a very long finnish."

11237,5666689,"#600. Excellent come back! I'm still sure this is one of most successful PNs from PT tasted so far. Layers&layers on the nose and palate-original notes from October are fully viable. After half a year it shows a light evolution where vegetal notes transform to herbal spices with cardamom&white pepper leading the endless orchestration. Balance&structure are simply great on the palate. Salty, mineral, v.long aftertaste. 4,3 again. VFM! Lay down, take a glass, pair it with Peter Green's 'Albatross' or... love."

Ruby color, ripe red fruits/berries aromas/flavors, specially cherry and raspberry, floral, with notes of cassis, eucalyptus, spices and an hint of salinity. Medium to full body, velvety tannins and a juicy lingering finish. Excellent Pinot Noir, with great value and already drinking very well, but still growing!"

11320,2050841,"Black olive, blackcurrant, blueberry and black pepper, mushroom aroma which makes me expect it to be earthy and smoky. At first taste, it is a bit sweet  and sour, but becomes sooo smoky and full of tannin. It has a unique and diverse bouquet. Berry and smokey notes, medium acidity and sweetness with high tannin seems opposite characteristics but mingles all with each other and balance of it is really good. Good pairing with garlic-marinated chilly chicken steak. "
11321,2050841,"(3.8) This is a great value, rich and smooth red with a beautiful soft mouthfeel and finish. It’s full of ripe red fruit, black cherry and blackberries with a vanilla rounding.

11326,45284,"It”s always with great pleasure that I return to this Douro wine from one of my favorite wineries, this one made 100% of Tinta Roriz (Portuguese Tempranillo). Lovely rubi color, floral, ripe red fruit, menthol and toast. The palate is bold, dry, spicy, with fresh acidity, smooth and well integrated tannins. Long aftertaste with pepper flavor. In 5 years it will be much better but I couldn't resist."

11332,45284,"Only produced in selected years, this 100% Tinta Roriz is made from the most prized vineyard plot of the estate from 35 yr old vines. Foot trodden in a traditional lagar after selective sorting. Lavish but not opulent, this deep purple gem attacks you with black and blue berries with dark chocolate, menthol aroma-flavours and deft use of oak. Suave mouthfeel, lively acidity and grippy tannins through a lingering finish. A gem that will benefit from cellar aging. A good match to a juicy steak. Viva Portugal!"

Fruity, slightly bitter mineral finish. Very dry. Fabulous!"

11353,1200518,"Crisp with citrus fruit as you’d expect but there’s also tropical fruit showing through, along with some minerality. All in all a good example of Vinho Verde (as it was categorised in the restaurant) from a favoured grape."

11359,2141689," Salmon pink colour, light red tones. Nice aroma of red berries. A very nice composed palate. Taste of cherry and strawberry. The palate is  fresh, dry and harmonic. Much less peach compared to my favourite Roses from Provence. But this is actually a quite good Rose.

11360,2141689,"Dry rose with some fruit taste from red fruit, raspberries and with some bitterness in the aftertaste. "
11361,2141689,"🌟3,3 The nose is not quite in harmony with palate. Alcohol is felt quite distinctively. 👃🏻sun warmed red clay soil of Algarve, burnt strawberry jam, overripe apricot, warm and comfy 👄Chill out well to balance a bit out and freshen up. M- acidity, M-body, lacks mid palate, a bit watery. More fresh red berries, grapefruit, blood orange, zesty bitterish finish. Not tannic. 🍽Not an easy sipping, but perfectly gastronomic rosé. Will go perfect with any red fish, shrimps, squids & grabs. Salmon pasta 🇪🇪🛒Airoso"
11362,2141689,Bob and Judith brought for dinner. Rich and complex. Moderate - supple tannins. Very good.
11363,2141689,"Fruity,too smooth and light on taste not very complex short finish"

11368,2141689,"Fantastic douro wine easy drinking,great..."
11369,2931116,"4th vintage of Douro white, this is an easy drinking light wine that can be paired with rich, flavourful food. 50% Arinto and 50% Rebigato. Good value and RP 91"
11370,2931116,"Nose. Very fragrant. Floral notes, mixed with orchard fruit and a hint of citrus. Palate. Green apple, pear, honey, and light amount of vanilla. Good body and structure. Medium acidity and alcohol. Long finish. Really excellent white."
11371,2931116,"4star for the price, green apple and fresh"
11372,2931116,I was a bit disappointed with this. Grass and lean without a strong bouquet
11373,2931116,Body: Medium plus.   Acidity: High.  Nose: The faintest scent of green fruit.  Palate: Notable oak notes. Maybe some grapefruit and lemon. 
11374,2931116,"Tasted in Cantinho from @jose_avillez. Surprising knowing that Meandro has a white version so i had to try it!  Pale lemon color, nice brightness. The nose is a very nice mesh with citric aromas and ripe stone fruit, very nice. Dry attack, great acidity, light bodied but long finish with frank notes. Very well done white wine! "
11375,2931116,"Very nice body. A bold white with great structure with balanced tannins and acidity. Dry fruit, apricot, plum, pear, melon oak. Long palate. Great white. "
11376,2931116,"Pale yellow color with small green reflection. Fresh with finest citrus aromas, green apple, floral and vegetal. Good acidity and medium fresh finish."
11377,2931116,"Fruity wine, good with grilled fish..."
11378,2931116,"Bright & fresh aromas of apple & citrus with slight notes of minerality and hints of citrus blossom. Flavors of green apple, pear, apricot & lemon. Smooth finish of stone minerality with touch of honey. Denser white wine with med+ body, med+ vibrant acidity with a vivid palate, good balance & nice freshness. Blend is Rabigato 60% and 40% Arinto. Solid budget friendly Portuguese white blend with some body that is very enjoyable. 12% ABV. Give Rabigato a try if you haven't had it. Very good quality, 3.8. 🇵🇹"
11379,2931116,"87/100 Price is wrong in Vivino, this is an entry-level white available under 12 euros in Portugal. This is crispy and pleasant but nowhere near the quality of the red wines at Vale Meão. Pineapple, yellow peach, mineral, and vanilla flavors. Easy drinking with bright acidity. "
11380,2931116,"Plum, Blackberry, dark cherry, currants, smooth and lively. Fruit forward. My first Portuguese wine. "
11381,2931116,"2019 vintage. Pale yellow in the glass, nose reminds us of Chardonnay, citrus fruits including grape fruit, lemon, hint of green apple and some tropical fruits feels almost ripe. minerals and oak adds some complexity. Fruits and minerals come through in the palate and feels full and oily thanks to 7 months aging on lees. Acidity keeps it fresh. Good savoury finish where citrus fruits linger a bit. Paired well with roast chicken.  "

11383,2931116,"Very aromatic, fresh"
11384,1769474,"Nice structure, acidity. Herbs."
11385,1769474,"One of the better organic wines I tasted lately. Oaky, but with lots of berries coming through. Easy going, well balanced smooth wine."
11386,1769474,"Light bodied, smokey with a cupcake berry crush taste. Love that it is organic and made in clay barrels. Brought this back from Portugal! "
11387,1769474,"Needs time to open up and settle. The nose never really does but the palate balances out with mainly red and brown fruit, some spice  and tarty acidity. No tannines nor real power though..."
11388,1769474,Complex light-bodied wine with the apple-like aroma. 
11389,1769474,"Dark fruit, some fig, spice and smoke, meaty tannins, pretty short finish. "

11392,1769474,Very smooth earthy and full of berries. Lighter than expected.   Very enjoyable wine. 
11393,1769474,"smooth, deep, a bit ground taste and a bit herbal, rather strong,"
11394,1769474,"Dark ruby red. Smoky aromas, black berries, blackcurrant, licorice. One of the better Portugal reds, good value. Pairs great with steak,"
11395,1769474,"What a smooth wine! In the tradition of the best alentejos, I like it!"
11396,1769474,"In the words of Bill Clinton, ""I have no recollection"" of how this got into my cellar, which is a shame, because it was a nice find. Impenetrable colour, with a reddish tinge, dark fruits and earthy notes on the nose, and these notes come through on the palate. An initial punch of tannins, but these fade quite quickly, as the wine breathes. Medium bodied, reasonably full flavoured, but quite subtly so, with plum and jammy overtones, and long length. Not much complexity, but what there is is very nice."
11397,1769474,"Black currant and earthy on the palate, dark in colour, long length with distinct tannins"
11398,1769474,Soft and light.  Does not feel like an alentejan wine.  But has a charm. Easy to drink.  Cherries.
11399,1184854,"Great big wine with raspy tannins. Not much fruit, sandalwood, cinnamon, and black cherries. Very nice. "
11400,1184854,"Red berries, well-balanced, good with red meat. "
11401,1184854,"Dark in colour, think and powerful in the mouth. Not an exhuberant wine, opens up a good while after opening. Great balance of acidity and wild fruits, smokey, wooden finish. Overall quite pleasant."
11402,1184854,"Excelente Douro Wine. Maybe a little lower alcohol content would even make it taster and avoid the fridge tip.  I started the year with this choice...strongly recommend the 2016 wine, even if this one is a 2010. "
11403,1184854,"Really good and solid wine, wonderful to the nose"
11404,1184854,Not too strong taste. Very tasty

11407,1184854,"Deep purple red colour with violet and lavender aromas with hints of cocoa. Nice acidity, great structure, balanced with firms and integrated tannins. Long, fresh and persistent finish."
11408,1911299,"Not a good colour,  not very aromatic but perfectly balanced and smooth in taste."
11409,1911299,"Good on the nose, with a very easy to drink body. A soft finish note for spices on the finish. A good price quality relation."
11410,1911299,"Ok, medium body, quite dry, some tannins. Rather fruity. Not bad everyday wine."
11411,1911299,"Smokey forrest fire and fresh ground black pepper with sweet cherries on the nose, sweet and jammy on the palate with smooth tannines and long finish. Strong resemblance to port!"
11412,1911299,"Nose: vanilla, mouth: plum low acidity, soft flavor."
11413,1911299,"Great wine. Bold with dark berries & plum, vanilla with a little spicy finish. Medium tannin, making it very easy to drink and enjoy. Great value wine, will be purchasing it again for sure! "
11414,1911299,"fruity, soft palate. Worth the wait (had the wine in our cabinet for 2.5 years, which certainly enhanced its quality)"
11415,1911299," Good wine, intense ruby, medium body, notes of clove, dry fruit and coconut, round tannins, balanced acidity!"
11416,1911299,"Deep garnet in color w some ruby hues. Aromas of strawberry, balsamic, dried herbs, black cherry, vanilla, and chocolate. Dry, med acid, med body, med alcohol, med tannin. Big notes of oxidized strawberry, pomegranate, and cola spice on the palate. Somme bitter cocoa notes on a med finish. Light and fun sipping wine. "
11417,1911299,Pretty much the same as before the Touriga Nacional leads the blend on the value driven Portuguese Red.  Deep ruby/garnet in color with notes of fruit jam and thyme.   Medium bodied with concentrated fruit that bombs the palate  The mouthfeel has low to medium tannin structure and low acidity making for a chewy fruit forward wine   On the palate it’s plum and pepper spice with hints of dried herbs  85pts
11418,1911299,Happy Hour Empório Santa Joana
11419,1911299,"Oak barrel and plum jam on the nose. Taste is mild, no dominant aromas. Ok for the price."
11420,1911299,"Nice wine. A little bit acid, but kinda decent."
11421,1911299,It worth! Cheers! 
11422,1911299,"3.2: Nervous wine, tannins and acidity present, leather, black olives, wood and spices.  Medium body, black fruits and pronounced alcohol.  Short finish and striking aftertaste."
11423,6328810,"Young! Violet, blackberries and plum. Also accented vanilla oak (without chocking everything else). Nice balance between tannins and acidity, a wine that will age well I would say."
11424,6328810,"I really liked it. Wine and no make-up of added things. Ruby color. Medium dry, with notorious acidity. With diverse fruity aromas and flavors (red fruit and black fruit). In the olfactory and gustatory plane it is fine. However, the world is not perfect: the label announces the controversial sulfites (for being commented by science and consumers as toxic) and alcohol in the 13.° range, which is too much for table wine, constituting a less gastronomic aspect. (Online wine tasting with the producer/ sample)."
11425,6328810,"Red fruit aroma, with moist soil notes. In the mouth is smooth, complex and delicate. Fresh and surprising wine. Long and p!pleasant aftertaste. Great wine"
11426,6328810,"Ruby red In the nose strawberry red cherry , forest floor, vanilla , olives. In the mouth, powerful fruit, noticeable and sweet tannins, medium plus body, long."
11427,6328810,"Red ruby color. Balanced acidity. Full body. Aroma and tastes of blackberry, plums, chocolate. Fresh mild tannins, lingering aftertaste. Enjoyable "
11428,6328810,It couldn’t really stand up to a simple Black Angus steak. 
11429,6328810,Very subtle bouquet. Strong notes of plum and blackberry. Drinks very dry. Finishes slowly. 
11430,6328810,Very good  wine perfect with red meat. Perfect balance between freshness and body ... 
11431,6328810,Top!! De textura facil
11432,6328810,"Balanced and enjoyable, but I miss more complexity"
11433,6328810,"Black cherry and quite port like on the nose. Rather cooked and stewed fruit, nice acidity keeps it together. OK. Prefer the Ontem red to the Ontem white. "
11434,6328810,"Nose of red cherry, oak. Medium bodied, pretty tannic. Red berries, hawthorn. Smells better than it tastes. "
11435,6328810,Bold fruity nose of strawberries and cherries. Dry and tannic and austere. Still a bit closed. 
11436,6328810,Lovely dry balanced wine. Full of flavor and long finish
11437,7268316,A beautiful numbered bottle with excellent flavour and smells.
11438,7268316,very good quinto from alentejo
11439,7268316,Complex but smooth. Slightly citric with a strong oak/almond aftertaste. Great pairing for an intense fish dish. 
11440,7268316,Strong oak aroma and an excellent price for this quality of wine.
11441,7268316,"Strong, structured, citric and woody. Great wine"
11442,7268316,"nice light, for white fish dishes "
11443,7268316,"This wine went straight to my top 3 white wines list. The way Arinto comes to life in here is epic! Presents a complex structure, with strong notes of honey and roasted nuts, but keeping an excellent acidity. This one won't be 'Esquecido'!"
11444,7268316,"Wow! What a wine! Full bodied, fresh and full of flavour! A must try wine!"
11445,7268316,"Always a pleasure coming back to this excellent white from Alentejo!  A rich and aromatic varietal of Arinto, aged 16m on large oak casks. Complex and concentrated, with smooth texture, crisp acidity and great length. Yellow straw color, mineral, citrus aromas/flavors, specially grapefruit, slightly floral with notes of lime zest, spices and an hint of toast. Dry, creamy and fresh, with a long juicy finish. Very gastronomic, with great aging potential!"
11446,7268316,"Second attempt at this one-even at one degree too high the mouthful is quite good slightly tropical yeast, but the alcohol is well integrated there are vegetal notes and maybe some kind of almonds-all together great great"
11447,7268316,"Wonderful white wine, with a great body and a super after taste of fruits and a delicate bitterness of almonds"
11448,7268316,"Well, a distinguished wine. "
11449,7268316,An amazing tasty wine .a fantastic mix of great grapes created an excelente aromatic wine.
11450,7268316,Needs the summer!
11451,7268316,"Extraordinary Arinto from Alentejo! Tasted it with some other, more expensive whites, none could match it! Almonds and dried apricots on the nose, it reveals a full body and a surprisingly complex array of flavours, from butter to grapefruit, cream and lemon zest, all perfectly combined in new oak barrels. Acidity is a little high, which is typical from Arinto grapes, still with some developing tannins, so one can easily keep it in the cellar a few years and surely it will turn to be a safe investment"
11452,76433,Very elegant Malvasia Fine with rare intense character in taste with medium acidity. The wine has very long potential 7+years further.
11453,76433,"[Grenache Lisboa 2/9] Despite being French, the chef knew that he shouldn’t shy away from Portuguese wines so each course was paired with local wines!  This Malvasia Fina from big name Cartuxa went like a dream with Confit Tomatoes, Anchovies, Bloodymary Sorbet and Parmesan Pannacotta.  Fresh nose with anise, wet stone, citrus and pear followed by a palate with restrained but pure acidity, citrus (mainly grapefruit and lemon), zest and stone fruit. 3.8"
11454,76433,Fruité mais sec 
11455,76433,Lovely clean finish and very well balance. Green apple and citrus and grapefruit notes. Delicious.
11456,76433,Citrus and apple. Buttery. Nice palate but short finish. 
11457,76433,"Spot on white, nicely floral and a clean finish. Matched our amanteigada sheep’s cheese and olives to a T! "
11458,76433,I wasn’t sure what to expect. It does come from a good stable and I wasn’t disappointed. Clean and dry with an excellent balance between alcohol and fruit. 
11459,76433,"Apple and floral nose. Buttery palate with lemon, green apple and slate. Very dry. "
11460,76433,"Part of wine pairing selection and certainly an amazing opening of an evening full of wine. Straw colour with light golden hues, gentle floral nose with notes of apple, honey and citrus. The body is initially on the light side with balanced acidity, but it holds well towards the finish. Solid notes of pear, yellow apple and citrus, are accompanied by hints of cantaloupe while it still remains a dry wine. Excellent proposal and definitely to be enjoyed in multiple bottles."
11461,76433,Golden and dense yet limpid. Lovely nose with notes of honey and coffee. Butery on the mouth with hints of tangerine and mint. Medium finish. What a Pleasant surprise from 10 years old Alentejo white! 
11462,76433, citrus honey butter grapefruit lemon
11463,76433,"Good, interesting, neither complex nor deep, but with a lot of personality and grit. It's 100% Assario, a grape with such a messy genealogy that even a nerd like me had to give up.   The permanence sur lies is clearly noticeable, together with a marked citric note (grapefruit style, bitter and vegetable) and a herbal note like tomato leaf. The mouth is intense, fresh and further citrusy, with a well perceptible - but not annoying - warm touch."
11464,76433,Light golden color. Cantaloupe and honey on the nose. Yellow fruit on the palate. Good.
11465,76433,Nice wine  Good moments to share with good friends 
11466,76433,Was good with fish
11467,1601201,"I was expecting a full bodied beast but I got a very smooth oaky red with a bitter finish and not much more in it. Disappointing is an understatement but that was 30 mins after opening. I tried again 2 hours later and had more fruit, spice,chocolate,still disappointing though, 28 euros in Bragança."
11468,1601201,"Wine made with Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca castes.  Deep ruby colour. Intense flowers, cardamom and forest fruits aroma. The first contact with the palate is of great freshness and polish, some eucalyptus and a lot of fineness, with a tasty and crystalline fruit, Very long and tasty aftertaste. Beautiful wine."
11469,1601201,"Beautiful red blend, the top notch wine of Quinta do Arcossó. Still quite young, with really intense, meaty red fruit, wild berries, chocolate with strawberry jam, hints of vanilla and an eucalyptus backdrop. On the palate, overpowering and bold, with very young, velvety, chewy tannins, very good acidity and a blackberry driven flavor profile. Great now, but lots of aging potential - one of these is going in my cellar, to open in 7-10 years!"
11470,1601201,"Impressive power ! Grapes harvested individually, has enormous structure, but with fine grained tannins. Fruit is pure but a bit on the mature side, almost syrup, and alcohol is also high, but the acidity balances it all very well in a mix of freshness and elegance, finishing long. What impresses most is it sill seems young despite being 8 years old. "
11471,1601201,Only 2000 bottles a year. Pressed with humans feet. Old fashion style. Very good.
11472,1601201,"A power-pack in magnum from the all knowing Sr. Salgado - despite being a sommelier to start with, spending a day with this man explaining his grapes, realizes one has much to learn. Spearmint for sure, but also young nettles and half ripe gooseberries, finely structured tannins and a 15% alcohol to do the final knock out.❤️ Needs decanting and maybe an hour to rest before presenting with it’s full structure drink now or save 5 to 6 years. "
11473,1601201,"Great drop. Very dark, pepper and gum tree nose. Dark fruit, chewy, food acidity, long finish. Worked well with porco a alentejana. "
11474,1601201,Full bodied red. very good wine.
11475,1601201,Dark Deep Colour.  Good Balanced.  Wunderful friuts with perfectly integrated tanins. Long Finish.
11476,1601201,Very elegant. Dark chocolate after taste which is very long. The best Red from Trás os Montes.
11477,1601201,"A dark violet Portuguese red with ripe red fruits and eucalyptus in the nose. A soft entry but a firm personality with a rich palate, medium to strong body and a good final."
11478,1601201,"Violetas, cereza, intenso, potente, largo"
11479,1601201,"I need to go by more,"
11480,1601201,This wine is a pearl. The grapes are individually hand-picked for their quality. 
11481,1601201,Lots of plum on the nose with lots of syrupy Port flavours.
11482,8076211,"What a great surprise this Portuguese cuvée was. Dark and ominous in the glass the nose softly displays aromas of black and red fruit, dried herbs, some nuttiness and cocoa. The palate was easy to enjoy. Medium bodied, with subtle tannins that grow with time, lively acidity and dry enough. Flavors range from black cherry, to red currant and pomegranate, supported by red chilies, dried rosemary,  clay pot and growing notes of earthiness. This wine really grew in depth and flavor as it warmed and breathed!"
11483,8076211,"Dark, ripe red fruit nose with some oak. Silky mouthfeel with a few tannins on the finish. Nice find."
11484,8076211,Value for money! 👌🏼
11485,8076211,"Red, almost black, ink in colour, this is rich and spicy like a good old fashioned black pepper Syrah, although with that pruney, Porty, Touriga Nacional (according to Vivino, not present?) overtone. Tastes more than its 14 ABVs!"
11486,8076211,Very smooth and tasty
11487,8076211,Bang for the buck!  red fruit red currant black cherry 
11488,8076211,"A very strong 4.5, more like 4.8 in fact. Excellent value."
11489,8076211,"Rich dark nose with dark fruit up front, very well integrated tannins and acidity and a long dry finish"
11490,8076211,"Burst of flavours of cranberries, cloves, pomegranate and black pepper, high acidity and bold tannins, a wine full of complexity, definitely has a high potential for ageing "
11491,8076211,"A good example of Douro Superior at a reasonable price. Black fruits in mouth followed by pleasant aftertaste. Nose is nice, in fact this is a nice wine. Probably will order 6 more to keep a while."
11492,8076211,"A blend of Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alicante Bouschet and Baga from Sabor river valley, Douro Superior, Portugal. Intense, spicy, jammy, nicely structured and elegant wine presenting notes of blueberry, plum, dark cherry, vanilla, licorice, tobacco, pepper and rosemary, with moderate silky tannins and long finish.  Founded in 1996, Quinta Vale D. Maria is one of Douro's most prestigious producers, who was a pioneer in combining traditional techniques with modern winemaking practices."
11493,8076211,Hint of barnyard on the nose. Red fruit. Tasty. Not heavy
11494,1136061,"A beautiful port from the largely undeclared '65 vintage - still masses of fruit, acid & tannin. Wonderful. "
11495,1136061,"Extra good fruity, "
11496,1136061,"Raisins, prunes... but port really is just not my thing. They shouldn’t let me rate this lol. Everybody else LOVES it"
11497,1136061,Really good port. Amazing nose and long sweet taste. It's nearly syrupy in texture and develops well when rolled around in mouth. Long heavy finish.
11498,1136061,It's still young but has ... everything you would desire from a port. My guess is ... get this one with another +10 years and you would be good
11499,1136061,What a beauty.  A friend brought this back for me from Portugal and we cracked it immediately.  Syrupy smooth with a focus on creamy caramelized gig and prune.  Very sweet and wonderfully warming.  My mum loves a great port and she was suitably pleased with the lusciously lingering finish.  Really lovely.
11500,1136061,"Colour is amber, medium. Intense rancid, nutty, burnt sugar nose- very appealing. Palate is sweet, medium bodied, medium plus acidity, red fruit, oxidised to perfection. Long lovely finish. Outstanding. (2006 bottling)"
11501,1136061,"Unbelievably a great tawny port, smooth, rich, creamy, so good. Cork was wrecked, decantered for three hours, eaten with fantastic Camembert, and rich blue cheeses. Current price on market 350+ euros"
11502,1136061,Clear amber with notes of dried fruit apricot and raisin well balanced and complex to the palete. To be enjoyed!
11503,1136061,"A fantastic port. Sweet and rich as you would expected, was also thin and elements of sherry in its taste and structure. Never had such an old port, but will definitely explore the old ones more now"
11504,1136061,"It was served at the end of our Quinta da Dôna Super-Vertical tasting session ... after the Reds and before the Sparkling :-) Great Tawny Porto 2 years older than me :-) Unique flavor of roasted and caramelized walnuts, vanilla and silky oxidative texture. Great surprise offered by Luis Seabra - creator of great wines like Granito Cru and Xisto Cru. Thanks Luis !!!"
11505,1136061,"Review #1982, so a 1982! From reviews #1986 to #2016! I'm going to review 31 consecutive vintages. It would seem rude not to!  Pale brown. Nutty w. walnut, hazelnut, crème brûlée, toffee, dried fig, raisin & sultana. Complex w. fruit cake, Christmas pudding, cinnamon, nutmeg & Muscovado sugar. Caramelised apple & delicate malted barley. Fully developed. Sweet. Rich & oxidative w. raisin, sultana & Xmas cake. Delicious richness. Med acidity, orange rind, crème caramel, high alc & a long finish. Outstanding!"
11506,1136061,My first experience w a 1961 port.  Very light in color but absolutely amazing all around.  This would be worthy of a 6th star.
11507,1136061,"Another beautiful old Colheita with perfect acidity, need a bit time at opening - Krohn is displaying another beautiful smooth aged port "
11508,1136061,Still the best wine - in the World!
11509,16378,Excellent Sauvignon Blanc at a good price from a region enjoyed often. Light fruits abound.

11524,2169643,"Medium ruby hue with a light brick rim.  Soft nose of cherry, clay pot, crushed gravel and menthol. The attack is soft and fruity, with good acidity. Mid palate comes with soft square structure and finish is marked by elegant but powdery tannins with retro olfaction of oak, sawdust, caramel and mushroom. "
11525,2169643,"Beira Interior / Rufete: The Talhão da Serra is, the label tells us, a 2ha vineyard where Rufete always matures well - giving rise to the producer's first 'terroir wine' - with this the 2016 vintage even exceeding expectations. For a Rufete, exceed expectations it certainly does: lovely and delicate with notes of cherry/berry fruit, wet/woody undergrowth and some smokey pepper, supple tannin, a little sourness; smooth, balanced, distinctive. (Integrated Crop Management / Sustainable Agriculture; 13% abv)."
11526,2169643,"This is Rufete - late maturing grape from a 2 acre vineyard on the slope of a small hill in Beira. A bit like a mix between Pinot and Barbaresco, not peppery and not the darkest fruit-with it’s own very special character, hard to describe. Great minerality, overall well integrated. One can really feel the winemaker allowing the wine to speak for itself, very little meddled with - pure terroir."
11527,2169643,"Rufete variety rocks! Spicy on nose, lively fruit with ripe cherries, good acidity, smooth tannins. What stands out is this dryness and minerality which makes it so interesting and elegant. Seems somewhere between a Pinot Noir and a Cab Franc. Well done, loved it. "
11528,2169643,"Diverge from typical Portuguese wines... but still delicious.   Full body, complex, aromatic, well structured. Present tannins that brings some type of freshness   Interesting wine"
11529,2169643,"Light red, almost Pinot in color. Nose of raspberry, red fruit. Tannins are abundant with great acidity. Very young and will be interesting to try in few years. Pure Rufete!"

11532,2169643,"Very enjoyable wine - medium bodied. Colour reminds one of a Pinot Noir. Nose- berries, cherries , slightly perfumed. Sour cherries , fruity - good acidity and long aftertaste. Diferent type of wine .  I was not previously aware of a 100%  Rufete wine I highly recommend it and hope they are able to make future vintages"
11533,2169643,"Red and black berry fruit and dark cherry jam stake turns in complex and inviting aromas. In the mouth a wine with soft tannins , good acidity , medium concentration of flavor in a exiting , dry body, with slight roughness at the end, to mark its typicality. It’s good acidity enables it to table. "
11534,2169643,"Redfruits, strong body, mouthfull "
11535,2169643,"First time experiencing rufete as a variety. Supple tannins, medium + acidity and balanced up with a good body. Something between Pinot and mencia. The flavour character that stood out the most for me was the ink sensation. I almost felt a grainy and rugged edge on the finish which made me somewhat confused. All for all, good quality wine with amazing potential. "
11536,2169643,"Very interesting full bodied wine, rich in color and woody cherry taste."
11537,2169643,Very nice Rufete wine

11570,6837549,Oaky vanilla and citrus with hints of butter. Very nice balance and crispness
11571,6837549,"Really tasty. Buckets of depth without tiring your palette. Plenty of oak influence, gently marrying to those tropical, rich characters. Mango, ripe peach & apricot. Decent acidity to keep everything in check & very moreish. Didn’t require decent or much aeration & was just as lovely on the second night!"
11572,6837549,"An absolute pleasure returning to this exquisite Douro white after one year!  A rich blend of Arinto (70%) and Códega (30%), aged 9m sur lees in new oak barrels (300L), with batonnage. Deep, complex and elegant, with crisp acidity and great length. Golden yellow color, citrus and tropical fruits aromas/flavors, specially pineapple, with notes of querosene, vanilla, salinity, an hint of toast and well integrated oak. Dry, creamy and fresh, with a juicy lingering finish. Splendid white, still growing!"

Fermented in large oak casks. "
11579,1270336,"Struck match upon opening that fades and a lot of lemon on nose. A little lemon and a lot of pear on palate. A really nice mouth filling texture. A really great value, but wasn’t quite complex enough to get to 4.5. "

Lemon pith, minerality, fruit I can’t quite place though not super fruit-forward. This is complex, cerebral and unconventional. It gets more enjoyable and less dry as the temperature rises (don’t serve this too cold). I’m happy to have it but I wouldn’t seek it.  With scallops with shallots and bacon."

11587,1270336,"Super interesting stuff here again from Filipa Pato.   Find Portuguese whites to be a little too vegetal for me at times and yet this has wonderful pineapple, lemon sorbet, hints of cream all tied together with that incredible acidity you come to expect from a.

11598,2156915,"This was something quite different. I bought a bottle of the highly rated Arrepiedo Velho Amma Red at the same time as this one, so this was considered the warm up act. It needs time to breathe for sure, deep violet, definitely dark berries and blue berries and dark chocolate. Not as good as the Cartuxa from the same wine variety but still enjoyed to the max, cheers 🍷🍷"

11622,3652286,"Sandeman’s single Quinta do Seixo (pronounced ‘say-ch’) is a wonderful spot to visit. Whilst drinkable now but keep this for 20+ years.  Inky deep purple.

Very rich w. high alc heat, high grippy tannins, m+ acid, juicy blackberry, caramelised blackcurrant & black cherry. Vanilla, liquorice, aniseed, chilli jam, crème de cassis & a long finish."
11623,3652286,This is one or best porto wine I've had for a Very long time. Sweet and soft with low acidity and wonderfully structured. This was a very nice experience specially when compared with other way more expensive options.
11624,3652286,"Lots of potential here but needs five plus years or more to figure out what it’s good for.  Aromas of blueberries, blackberries and black plum. Aforementioned fruits on the palate with some fig and violet.  Not overly sweet at this stage, but a rich and powerful port nonetheless.  Nice single Quinta but will be interesting to watch it mature alongside classic vintage ports.  "
11625,3652286,"Needs ample time to aerate. I opened it, had a glass, corked it, and I am trying it again now four days later; incredible difference. Lots of blueberry, cherry, nutmeg, pepper, and cedar on the nose. Slightly sweet and jammy, pleasant mild acidity, more spiced red fruit, and show-stopping, big, firm tannins. Long finish. Delicious!"

11629,3652286,"I shared this bottle with 9 friends. We have all visited the vineyard. It’s unanimous…this wine is a perfect 10! A melts in your mouth treat that has depth of color, complexity of flavor, and a long smooth finish. "
11630,3652286,"An impressive range of ports on offer at the Decanter Fine Wine Encounter last weekend, including 8 from Sandeman. Good news, as I wasn't able to fit in a visit to Sandeman in Gaia in October. Sandeman have bucked the trend by not declaring a vintage port in 2017. This young Quinta has a real concentration of fruit, 2017 is such an intense vintage. Deeply coloured and sticky. Leafy, spicy. Palate seems well balanced. Very good, although it lacks the awesome intensity of e.g. the Quinta do Noval 2017."
11631,3652286,Very sweet and smooth!! The very best Porto I’ve had so far!
11632,3652286,"Since it’s WDW I’m following @[1|10995390|Red] and @[1|17931985|Cs Runner] by sacrificing this vintage port for a✅.

11633,3652286,"Gosh! Golly! Dang! Geewhiz! A Port turned me on my head? Holy cow! As luxurious a wine as I’ve had. Sweet but not too sweet, complex flavors and a long, viscuous finish. This suckah wins the gold!  Run, don’t walk, to wherever you can buy some today!!"

11652,2045239,Needs to breath. Goes from a tannic full bodied punch in the face to a velvety silky smooth ripe dark fruit taste bomb. Still one of the best portugese i have tasted
11653,2045239,"Powerful. 9 years in the making, strong dark fruit, oak, leather. Subtle year strong body, thick with the plum and jam. The tannins are subdued but the length remains. Great wine. Worth the wait"
11654,2045239,"That's the right bottle to round up the first weekend evening. Very good Portuguese blend of Aragonez, AB and Trincadeira. Alentejo terroir seems to serve all these three grapes. AB from France, Aragonez from Spain and Trincadeira local Portuguese grape. Full bodied with deep dense color. On the nose there is the work of Trincadeira with aromas of blackberries and herbs. Completed by influence of Aragonez with red berries. AB gives to all these jamminesse. The best of these 3 grapes combined to perfect wine"
11655,2045239,"Full, intense, herby nose with a spicy, slightly tarry edge. Very appealing. Good concentration on the palate. Intense, herby edged tarry berry fruit. Nicely savoury with some good structure. "
11656,2045239,"Green strawberry, minerals and forest floor. Nice find!"
11657,2045239,"A great expression of the big reds from the Alentejo. Bold and fleshy, with round but vivid tannins. I was really impressed by the complexity and depth of aromas, which start you at cassis jam, rhubarb, licorice and freshly crushed mint leaves. Closing with cloves, dried bay leaf and white pepper. "
11658,2045239,"Blend of Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez and Trincadeira from Alentejo. Selection of the best grapes. Fermented in traditional Lagares (open vats). 12 m new barrels aging.  Garnet red. Striking nose. I have no idea what it is - cooked red fruits? Some vanilla. Palate with big notes of cranberry, crushed berries, bramble fruit and sourly red berries. Graphite. Complex structure. Slightly spicy. Rich and powerful. Bold and dense.  Needs time to open up.   "

11669,5839995,"Dark red, red berries, cherry and spices on the nose. Medium body with medium tannins, redcurrant and sour cherry even some licorice on the palate. This wine has lot of potential, now the tannins were a bit raw."
11670,5839995,"Basic weekday portuguese red.   Cherries, cranberries , raspberries,  pepper, herbs and vanilla oak on nose. Vivid acidity and rounded tannins on palate. Medium bodied and medium fruity finish. Slighly one dimensional texture.  Not so good pairing with lamb despite name. "

11710,2140861,A fruity and pleasant wine that went with the steak served at La Vaca Negra in Funchal. Deep red fruits with some toffee and tobacco. Not as well balanced as I had hoped.

11715,1235048,"Rich, full-bodied red with dark cherry, leather, earth, tobacco and some oak. Smooth on the front end with a proud finish. Great with food and when found on sale for around euros, it’s a big winner. "
11716,1235048,"Quintessential, if subtle, Alentejo. Pretty in the glass, shimmery. Gorgeous, complex bouquet. Varietal red & black fruits, fennel, a strong herbiness, with basil & thyme, plus light vanilla. I can’t stop sniffing this. Too good for food. The fruit is thinning out on the palate, though, so drink up. Gentle in the mouth. A balanced tail, with earth, particularly long, if small. Bunch of awards. Neat Alentejo cork label. I visited this co-op’s shop years ago in tiny Borba. 4.1 solid woofers. A lovely bottle."
11717,1235048,"Medium ruby in color with medium intensity nose. Ripe cherry, raspberry, black cherry, red currant. Dry, medium acidity, medium tannins, full bodied, high alcohol and medium intensity body. Juicy fruit with some leather tannin qualities. Very good quality of wine. Long finish."

11721,1235048,"Starts dry with an astringent middle and a sweeter finish. Light for an Alentejano.  The longer it opens the more engaging it becomes, less astringent.  A perfect companion for an amazing porco preto in a cool adega while the sun shines outside  "

11727,3327618,"Tasted a lot like Right Bank wines. On the nose, floral, sweet elements.  On the taste, refined tannins, black plums, blueberries and silky finish. 89 pts "
11728,3327618,"I rarely drink Merlot, let alone one from Portugal. This one won’t change that but it was pleasing enough with the rack of ribs you can see in the background on the bbq I expertly set up 😉.  Nose with prune, oak, undergrowth and green bell pepper followed by a friendly, mellow palate with fine acidity, dry tannins, plum, vanilla, smoke, cigar box and more of that green bell pepper. 3.3"
11729,3327618,"Very nice Merlot from Lisbon area.   Nice surprise here. Nose is intense sweet red pepper, red fruit and some oak. Medium body,  with fruit and a green balsamic which makes it very fresh, despite tannins still needing some time to cool off. Improves greatly with food, but overall a good surprise. "
11730,3327618,"Lots of leather, black pepper and mulberry but a little too dry and tannic for its own good. "
11731,3327618,Tannic and vegetal 
11732,3327618,Too much wood and not enough structure behind. Rather mainstream.

11749,1314401,"Bright citrusy yellow colored wine with a savory aromatic of lime zest, freshly cut grass, green melon, asparagus and peppery goose berry scents. The acidity is enveloping and vivid,herbaceous notes on the lingering finish are typically of variety and terroir . Good value for money! "
11750,1314401,"Slightly disappointing, strong flavours. Not easy to drink. "
11751,1314401,Most western sauvignon blanc of europe

11757,1191946,Suprisingly better than my expectations. Served as a table wine. Medium body. Oak aroma is bursting at it’s best. Good news is that I liked that very much. Seems that they’ve mastered the barrels exceptionally well..

Caramel and hazelnut immediately on the palate, with golden raisin, apricot and Brazil nut.  Long, long luxurious finish.  Scott White take note - this White Port Rocks!"
11778,76372,"Walnuts and toasted figs. Roasted fig, liquid walnuts, distilled sunshine. A magnificent port from the oldest port house in the world. Barrel aged 50 years in oak.  "

11794,1175612,"This is a great port, vibrant and delicious, and for me half a star better than Noval’s Colheita 2000.  My notes said “drink and celebrate life!”.    Light tawny colour.  Nose of caramel, orange, fruitcake, walnut and wood smoke. The palate is quite developed, very silky, with clove, cinnamon and nutmeg spice. High acidity, but not as high as the 2000 vintage.  Superb! "
11795,1175612,"Great port. Colhetas are bottles on demand. Fully oxidized and elevated on alcool (21.5%), it will age forever "

11823,1136448,"Love the taste, full body and fruity despite 19% alcohol content."
11824,1136448,Wine tasting at Skovgaard. No notes

11834,1136448,"Slightly rustic, dried herb aspect to this port. A little peppery, rich, full-bodied, young. Plums, figs and blueberries. Quite soft so already approachable. Very good."

11837,5929190,"Tropisch fruit, sinaasappel, grapefruit in de afdronk. "
11838,5929190,Pale yellow. Exuberant on the nose as a moscatel should be. Extremelly floral with notes os passion fruit and green apples . A great Douro White.

11840,5929190,"Deliciously perfumed, good structure and right acidity. Absolutely ravishing"
11841,5929190,"Another good value Portuguese wine, great with sushi. Fruit forward with lychees, mango, ripe pineapple and melon. Medium acidity and finish. Easy drinking."
11842,5929190,Medium+ body with stone fruit next to a lot of herbaceous/green notes. A little too much for my taste. Also some herbs and hay in here. Does become a bit one-sided by the second glass.
11843,5929190,"(3.7) I tasted the 2016 last year which was nice but lacked fresh acidity. This year had a bit more but could still do with some more.  In the nose wild strawberries, Muscat, vanilla, bread. Medium acidity, smooth, candied citrus fruit, drying chalky ending."

11853,1294904,Extremely pleasant claret. Neutral nose. Clean straight taste of bread crumb with light fruit tones. Slightly acidic aftertaste makes it firm and complex.
11854,1294904,"Totally clear!!! So unique. Also almost zero nose which makes it seem even more invisible. Nice green apple and white fruit notes, off sweet. Crisp acid. "
11855,1294904,"This was the most unique wine that we had on this trip in Portugal! It’s not available in the US, so bring some bottles home when you can! "

11869,75977,Not as dry as some talk about and easier maybe less complex or not so full bodied than many Douro wines - plum and raspberries with a lovely med to long finish. Very enjoyable wine for the price point! 4 stars from my wife and I! 
11870,75977,Casa Ferreirinha is by far the most iconic portughese producer...  Barca Velha its most iconic red that side by side with Pera Manca represents the historic portughese wines. Althogh sold to Sogrape wines quality has kept its level.  Esteva is the producer starting red. And a remarcable value for money...  One of best reds in its price range... Very good!
11871,75977,"Pleasant ripe nose. Strawberry and cranberry. Medium bodied, muted flavours initially, then it comes to life. Smokey palate with hints of cherry and some raspberry and strawberry. High tannic finish. "

11881,3830208,"Packs quite a fruity punch of flavours.  A nice balance between fruity sweetness and a crisp acidity to leave the palate delighted.  White fruits, soft citrus, yellow floral and touch of pear skin in aromas.  Flavours, when nicely chilled, are vibrant with a zestiness along with fruits including green gage, apple, floral and more. A nice length that leaves the mouth salivating."
11882,3830208,"Tasted at the producer. June 2020. 👃 is weak. Mouth is great,  superb balance between sugar and acidity. Very universal white.  Long,  sticky in the mouth. "
11883,3830208,"Good value for sure and a nice change from Alvarinho. Nice acid structure envelopes citrus notes like lemon, lime grapefruit and some tree fruit like white peach and a bit of floral white blossom. Nice minerality at the core"

11885,3830208,"Crisp and fruity, surprisingly nice! Citrus and green apple."

11897,6021428,"Intense, deep flavour, better nose , Nice blend of tradicional varietals"
11898,6021428,A good Dão spiced but full of mature blackcurrant. Good Finnish sober tending to complexity and dry. Good priced and nice match to Portuguese BRAZILIAN cuisine.
11899,6021428,Very dry nice finish
11900,6021428,"smooth, good complexity "
11901,6021428,Too fruity and full. Ok dry
11902,6021428,A little dry and spicy. It went great with a grilled meats dinner in Porto. 
11903,6021428,"Damn good for the value, a weekday treat"
11904,6021428,"It must be the atmosphere in Lisbon... every wine you try is fantastic! Full bodied Dāo with plenty of spices and ripe berries. Needs to breathe, though. Long and silky aftertaste, with lots and f smoked spices. Extremely easy to drink and pair. "
11905,6021428,"Intense ruby color with expressive aromas of black fruits, red fruit and violet mixed with wild flowers. Good texture, firms tannins and medium finish "
11906,6021428,"Fresh and delight, with hints of strawberry and citrus. "

11909,6021428,"[Restaurant Sommelier, Lisbon 2/4] We selected a variety of starters so a red was also necessary. I left it to the sommelier and we got this nice Dão.  Subtle, earthy nose with black cherry and cinnamon followed by a fruity palate with nice, tart, integrated, dry tannins, black fruit and licorice. 3.6"
11910,6021428,"A decent red table wine from Dão.  👃 Plum mainly (pronounced)  👅 Plum, blackberry. High alcohol. Medium+ acidity, and body. Medium flavor intensity, tannins and finish."

11916,75021,"3.5 ⭐️ for this Portuguese Lisboa 🇵🇹 white wine. 👁 Clear visual with a pale straw color. 👃 Good aroma with a first sniff dry and fresh with some mineral and a second sniff focused on white fruits. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of mineral; medium body. Good persistence in the mouth with short finish. Elegant white wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🥂 "
11917,75021,"A pale lemon color.  Medium intensity on the nose with citric tones.  Dry in the mouth with medium acidity, medium alcohol level and medium body.  Mineral tones also present. Green fruits flavors along with lychee and lemon hints.   Medium finishing. "
11918,75021,"Simple Arinto, medium body but with an ever so slight Sweet finish that would stop me from drinking too many glasses. Good value for €9.50 in Dublin. "
11919,75021,Kiwi and citrusy notes.  Grassy shade and quite minerally. Not great but not bad for the money. Saúde!
11920,75021,O Picadeiro- just as great as the food and the time spent with friends. Great afternoon wine. 
11921,75021,citrus grapefruit pear honey 7.5

11927,1189511,"Repetindo! Parece ser uma versão simplificada do Clos de Los Siete argentino. Um belo vinho. 3,75 Repetition! It seems to be a simple version of the Argentinian Clos de Los Siete. A nice wine."

11929,1189511,"Didn't expect much, but boy was it Smooth.  Cannot go wrong with the price point. "
11930,1189511,Full body explosion of flavour 
11931,1189511,"2016 - to the difference of prev. years this very able vintner has shaped up and has labeled four local and noble varietals in the bottle. Wine is still strict and with a large integrity. It requires a bit of digging to find the The dark boysenberries, maybe even a hint of olives and capers. It’s clear that the soil composition is anything but fat & juicy - stressing the vines up to the level where they take on minerals and all sorts of base notes - which could make it a thinking mans wine - down the road."
11932,1189511,"I’ve given this bottle a bad review a year or so ago, but this time I’ve given it a better rating, it’s a fairly dry and bold red, not my favourite so I definitely let the missus have some of this one as I feel It wouldn’t be a waste on her 🤙"
11933,1189511,Full bodied and very dry wine with lots of dark fruity on the nose. Plum and cherry in the mouth. 
11934,1189511,"Good wine, quite dry and didn't open up as much as expected. Dried cherry nose, herbacious and an sedge of savory. Mixed berries on the palate, red fruit followed with coffee, sage and leather. A fine tannin, and bone dry finish. "
11935,1189511,Yeah. Lots of stickers. But it tastes like I’m chewing a ball of aluminum foil that’s surrounding 12 Bayer Children’s Aspirin.   Next
11936,1189511,"Good oaky wine, a bit overated in Canada, low alchool, its a light bodied typical young vineyards. Good catch for a region with not much options. Good with a piece of beef or a pasta dinner ."
11937,1189511,"Super smooth wine. Was fired up when I tried it, probably cause I wasn’t expecting much for the price. But very good!"
11938,1189511,Still a great Portugal fruity full red 
11939,1189511,"Very smooth, juicy red fruit and well balanced tanins "

11944,1928037,"Chocolate, cherries and oak."
11945,1928037,"Medium body vino, rich fruit forward with cherry and red currents. Oak, chocolate and leather, light tannins. Something different is nice and noticed a slight flaw in depth "

11951,1928037,"Easy to drink, medium body fruity red"
11952,1928037,Very good full of southern Portugal sin. Rich of taste of different grapes. I do recommend it for a more special occasions
11953,1928037,"Medium body, Berry’s flavor, a little over acid.  "
11954,1928037,"The Plansel was very solid for the price. Dry, medium-bodied, fairly tannic and plenty of flavour. It benefits from some air. It's nothing too complex, but very enjoyable."
11955,1928037,"Excellent dry red. Starts fruity, ends dry. Highly recommend. "
11956,1261672,Excellent smooth Portuguese sparkling wine. A good compromise between Prosecco and Champagne. Smoother than the normal reserva. Perfect to make Aperol Spritz.
11957,1261672,"Life can't get any better than this! Drinking Murganheira on a private villa in Douro valley. Shy nose of yellow apples and minerality. Dry, med- bodied, med- acids, small bubbles. Delicate palate following the nose. Yellow apples turning into bruised ripe apples in a med long finish. Toasty oaky palate. Not that ""special"". But these surroundings makes it special. If you like your bubbly wines delicate and ripe, pick murganheira. If you can get one..."
11958,1261672,"Something unique and special about her. Clearly Portuguese, but not as usual. A light yellow sparkling wine. Apple and vanilla notes. Well balanced acidity and fruit. Did not pair well with the sardines at all. "
11959,1261672,"N: citrus, toast, apples P: dry, delicate small bubbles, medium- minerality T: follows nose F: short, consistent"

11961,1261672,A steal for this money
11962,1261672,Great value - yummy
11963,1261672,There is some serious sparkling coming out of Portugal!
11964,1261672,"One of the best sparkling wines at the moment. Bright, mineral, complex. Apples and shades of zest in nose. Complex, time dependent palate, bright lemon start, sweetish frozen apple in the middle, calm green apple and lemon zest finish."
11965,1261672,"Between 3 and 3,5. Lacks finesse, quite harsh, very acidic. The worry was on the freshness but created a wine that doesn't give full pleasure of drinking and becomes a bit boring. "
11966,1261672,"85/100  Wasn't aware that there was such thing as a Portuguese sparkling wine.  Tight, but lacks the amplitude and depth of a champagne. Fizzes out rather quickly and then loses substantially all interest."
11967,1261672,"Slightly dry, with a light feel. Combines perfectly with the traditional suckling pig “à bairrada”.  pear citrus"
11968,1261672,Very much like a Prosecco. 
11969,1261672,Nice mousse and tastes like a good champaign (contains same grapes )
11970,1261672,"Can be compared with cava and prosecco but without the typical rubber/pear notes. Surprisingly mineral in the nose, dry and sweet at the same time. But too floral and yeasty for my taste. A good ”cava” but not in the same league with Champagne and Franciacorta. "
11971,1480583,"Fruity, dry, medium low tannins vanilla and anise flavors accent the pomegranate currant flavors and show off the medium high acidity.  Really nice wine for the price.  Bought it in a boutiquey wine shop in Lisbon our first night here."
11972,1480583,"Dry, full body, rich flavor, red berries, raspberry, vanilla, oak"
11973,1480583,"Smooth, full bodied with soft tannins. Berries and chocolate with a hint of oak. Really delightful."

11975,1480583,"Very intense wine, good on beef."
11976,1480583,"Nice yellow tone. Deep fruit tone with scents of rhubarb, smoke and some oak character. Very dry and mature tone with fruity character and nice body."
11977,1480583,"👃 warm, spicy, oak, cherry, vanilla, chocolate and some earth notes, perhaps mushroom or truffles.  🍷 sweet, medium bodied, low acidity and a smooth aftertaste. "
11978,1480583,"An example of a wine that just keeps growing in its expressiveness and evolved from 3,5 to 4. Delicious"
11979,1480583,Chocolate notes... Balanced fruit and oak. Smooth and velvety tannins with long finish. Very good wine. 
11980,1480583,"red berry vibrant, tannins in the right place Very dry with some acidity "

11987,90059,"3.75 Decent Portuguese offering. Unoaked yet packed with fruit & some structure & complexity.  Backed by Chateau Lafite (who's Bordeaux wines sell for over £1k) & from one of Portuguals more expensive regions.

11992,90059,"Dark inky red verging on purple in the glass Nose of plum and cassis  Very full dark fruits initially plum, blackcurrant and cassis.  Very smooth low tannin and no wood finish which is a nice change for Alentejo.  Finish is sweet."

11994,90059,"It is now four years since I started reviewing wines on Vivino. This will probably be my last year though when I hit the 1000 mark. As for the wine, it is well known and continues to have great value for money. "
11995,90059,"Nice and lovely on the tongue, almost full bodied punch afterwards. Fights well with duck or even lamb. "
11996,90059,Very good Alentejo. Good balance and medium body. Blueberries and some vanilla aromas
11997,90059,"Chocolate, vanilla and nutmeg. Gorgeous "
11998,90059,"Bit dry & bold, delicious woodish oak flavored"
11999,90059,Still a very good Alentejo wine. Keeps its taste also after one day.
12000,90059,Straight forward wine. Good pairing with steaks. Red currant and strawberry are noted.
12001,75606,"Sour cherry, black and red currants on the nose. Mild black fruit and oak flavours with a long smooth finish with mild tannins. "
12002,75606,"I’m not usually drawn to wines at 15% alcohol, however this is a finely balanced, drop with beautifully integrated flavours. Sour cherry, a little tobacco, prunes, aged in oak, and yet the alcohol never overpowers. I reckon Malbec fans would rejoice.   Stands up really well with spicy food. Exceptional for the price. "
12003,75606,"Aged in French oak for 12 months this tantalising blend of Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez and Trincadeira is a little gem with many indulgent qualities. Deep ruby in colour it announces itself to your palate with a fanfare - spiced plums, cherries & blackberries - silky smooth and soft tannins but my word - they appear with a headlong rush! Decent tannins, the finish is rewarding if a little peppery. Summary: Maybe a tad overwhelming at first, if you can get past that point it’s a heartwarming treat."
12004,75606,"Good red wine with acidic and dry finish, oak and dark fruit for an amazing reserve from 2016 of the Carmin house! "
12005,75606,"Same review , same taste"
12006,75606,Good at that price range. But I’ve had five beers and a couple of g&t s so who am I to judge. 
12007,75606,Very good wine dark colours and good value 
12008,75606,Can’t go wrong with an Aragonez Trincadeira combo. Really rich and tanniny. Great with meats but also with cheese. Vinos from the Alentejo easily my favourites from Portugal 
12009,75606,"Smoke and leather balance mildly to develop a smooth no nonsense Wednesday night red. A little tobacco, typical of the region, pairs well with lamb or game. Cassis and vanilla notes at the end. "
12010,75606,"Oak flavor, nice balanced for meals, reasonable pricing "
12011,75606,"Better than expected with fresh cherries and raspberries on the nose, definitely bathe Reserva is bolder and easy to drink. It lacks complexity and doesn’t evolve along the tasting but still pleasant. Overall a decent blend within regional typicité. Cheers! "
12012,75606,A bit on the sweet side but otherwise an acceptable wine.  Not a heavy or strong wine despite 14.5% alcohol. 
12013,75606,"3.25 Nice every day bottle, bit better that the price sugested. Black currant, red currant, forest floor and hints of oak. "
12014,75606,"Smoke, deep, well balanced and a really good wine. "
12015,75606,"Smooth, touch of spices, medium to long finish. Great with chocolate deserts."
12016,1408345,"Good wine. 👁 dark ruby red color. 👃 red fruit and pepper. 👅 good tanines, with some weight. Good accidity."

12027,1408345,"Fruity, woody and alcoholic. Medium to light body. Nothing special. Okay for the price."

12029,1408345,"Thaís Reserva red Wine is a blend of the best Portuguese wines, Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca e Cabernet, aging in old barrels and new, combining depth structure and complexity,  great finesse and elegance on the nose spices, vanilla and cherries. Tastes full body dark chocolate with great potential. Wow"
12030,1408345,Excelente custo beneficio. Acidez boa e bom tanino. Final prolongado
12031,76101,"Back to Portugal!  To be very honest, I do not know what do I drink, because most of grape varieties are unknown to me, but I will switch to don't like/like/like very much mode. To compliment very good burgers I picked one wine from Dao and one from Alentejo. This one is from Dao and I quite liked it because it was very drinkable and enjoyable."
12032,76101,"Light taste. Cherry smells. Reminds me of a Campania Aglianico.  Not bad, not great. Nice to have a wine after 2 weeks with beer."
12033,76101,"Quite strong, tanines. Fine with red meat. "
12034,76101,Ok but really a bit dry and rough
12035,76101,A good balance between the the fruity and the dryness
12036,76101,"Not horrible. Tannins seemed to hit me hard and overmuch. Had it with steak, potato fingerlings, avocado. Maybe needed to be decanted."
12037,76101,"Rund, god, ikke for kraftig"
12038,76101,Beef and cheese. €14
12039,76101,Tasty and smooth finale. Not too fruity.
12040,76101,Very good.  Fruity flavors
12041,76101,We're drinking this in a restaurant.  The mark up is400% but it's really ok.  Good colour and nose . Quite Dry. Honey in the background 
12042,76101,Easy and plain to drink.
12043,76101,"High acidity, good wine for sea food"
12044,76101,An absolute steal. This wine opens with a little time. Big flavor with a medium body. Dark cherry and a little tobacco on the finish. Great value.
12045,76101,"Black cherry, plum, black currant, licorice, pepper, forest floor, and toast aromas on the nose. Dry, medium bodied, with spicy black fruit on the palate. Soft with a refreshing acidity and a lasting finish. Very good value."
12046,1286435,"Little but Sharp touch of bitterness, short, volatile"
12047,1286435,Tenprelino grapes. A bit Rioja style wine. From Douro
12048,1286435,"Superbe smooth and fruity, great discovery.."
12049,1286435,"Intense aromas of red fruits, red cherries and strawberries, and white pepper, slightly floral. Medium body with high acidity and well balanced tannins."
12050,1286435,Very well balanced tannins. Bold Douro red that was very enjoyable over dinner buy would also stand on its own
12051,1286435,The first sip seemed a bit sharp yet after half an hour it became easier to drink and very aromatic with spices touch at the end. The next day even taste better.
12052,1286435,"Berry, dry, vanilla and oak. Very balanced"
12053,1286435,"WAITERS CHOICE!  We wanted a red that is soft, gentle and pleasing. My colleague did want a wine that's like a fur in your mouth with soft tannins. We got this one...nice pick!!  (👁) deep  blue-red-purplish color.  (👃🏻)  lots of berry aromas in the nose. Especially forrest berries added by cherries and spices.  (👄) berries on the palate, liquorice (that I love a lot), medium acidity with a light sweetness towards the finish.   Portuguese wines have a really good qpr!!"

12058,1286435,"Great wine, no acidity, not too fruity, light and soft. Very pleasing - perfect with fish."
12059,1286435,"Caramel and forest berries bouquet with a nice dry finish typical of the Douro region of Portugal. Pairs with red meats, game, cheese and blue fish. "
12060,1286435,"It’s wine, it was good, there are better"
12061,76372,"Tasted with Spiegelau Expert tasting glass. Nice sharp rim and slightly bigger than the INAO standard glass. This Colheita 2002 is very fruity with deep raisin and fig aromas. Alcohol is there but more controlled than ruby ports. Elegant, sweet spice, coffee, smoke tones. Long finish. Good on its on or eg with a banoffee dessert. 87 Wine Spectator points. "
12062,76372,"Raisins, fig and a bit of brandy! The alcohol is still with this! But I'm loving on it! Needs 10 more years at least!"
12063,76372,This is an empty bottle. A piccolo. My wife drank most of it. Can't really recall what the specs are.  Solid brand off course. Probably good stuff. Thanks. 
12064,76372,"Clear, ruby red. Nose of rasins, prunes and sweet, red fruit. Palette of concentrated, rich fruit. Sweet, but balanced with acidity. Nutty character of almonds. Rich, juicy fruit. Lightly spiced, elegant barrel. Long finish.  Delichious port."
12065,76372,No TN. Our first live Port & Music night with friends after a long period of lockdown. We’re so happy and enjoying it!
12066,76372,"Better than the 2000 vintage. Honey, wood, earth and raisins. Spicy finish."
12067,76372,Prefer aged port but this is nice with apples and walnuts and Gorgonzola!
12068,76372,"PX light ;-). Nice, you just have to eat 🧀 if you taste this port. "
12069,76372,Oaky delicious port prune caramel tobacco
12070,76372,4.2 🇵🇹 Lovely Colheita. Raisin caramel nutty prune and almond

12073,76372,"Very nice, affordable, colheita tawny!"
12074,76372,"Bold start but short body, high alcohol, jammy cherry, sweet with heavy fruit"
12075,76372,Decent colheita but not a great one    Will try a different vintage next time
12076,1272225,"Both earthy and fleshy, this wine rocks. I found it to be velvety and full of dark fruit. Some caramels come through after about 40 minutes. Pair with beef steak, medium, lemon sprinkle."
12077,1272225,"🇵🇹 Revisitado.  Vinho de cor rubi escuro, tem aromas de frutos negros sobressaindo as cerejas e amoras, no paladar notas de chocolate e carvalho, é estruturado, aveludado, taninos e acidez muito equilibrados com um final longo e persistente.  🇬🇧 Revisited.  Dark ruby ​​colored wine, with aromas of black fruits, with cherries and blackberries standing out, on the palate notes of chocolate and oak, it is structured, velvety, very balanced tannins and acidity with a long and persistent finish."
12078,1272225,"Amazing wine. Staged in the bottle for 9 years and it is both complex and fresh. Dark red, strong and powerful in the nose and mouth. Ripe dark fruits with lots of spices (pepper, ginger). High alcohol not noticed but with some liquorice and wood. Smooth tannins and long long finish."
12079,1272225,"I really like this wine. Not used to Portuguese wines although travelled there 20 years ago several times. But according to the press this country have developed quality. I would drink this wine everyday over many other well known wine. Deep colour, great combination of fruit and oak. Bit of caramel in the taste. Close to Ribera or Priorat. Quality wine. Definitely worth the € 13 (got it on sale for 8:-)"
12080,1272225,"Portuguese red blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet from Alentejo region aged for 12 month in French oak. Deep, dark red colour. Forest berries, smokey, hints of tobacco and leather on the nose. Full body, smooth tannins, medium acidity. Thick, fleshy, fruity, various red berries, not overly concentrated or complex but delivers easy drinking experience."
12081,1272225,"(90/100) Fantastic Alentejo, complex, dark fruit. But the temperature should be controlled at 16C"
12082,1272225,Slightly more acidity than the 2009 vintage. Very good alentejano
12083,1272225,"Dark garnet color, dry, dark fruit very nice for a 10 year old Alentejo wine"
12084,1272225,Nice bouquet and nice flavour!
12085,1272225,Full body. Great finish
12086,1272225,"Very dark, almost black in color. Bouquet of blackberries and blackcurrant. The taste has dark berries, blackberries, oak, tobacco and a vanishing hint of caramel.  A little short finish and I have no doubts about the alcohol -it is high! I like it, but it lacks the elegance and is not as good today as yesterday. That is the reason for 3,5 ⭐️ "
12087,1272225,"Very dark fleshy with powerful bouquet of blackberries, blackcurrants, oak and tobacco. Similar rich taste with dark berries, oak, tobacco and lots of tannins in spite of its age. More powerful than refined, but very good for the price of 10.5 €."
12088,1272225,"Color deep purple red. Nose of black fruits, chocolate, smoke. Mouth powerful, full bodied"
12089,1272225,Full bodied. Fruty. Pleasing
12090,1272225,Spirit of Portugal. Very good. 
12091,1136061,It's still young but has ... everything you would desire from a port. My guess is ... get this one with another +10 years and you would be good
12092,1136061,"Silky fruit, dried fruit as well, but if spice and some slight nuttiness. Still has that vibrancy of the 1995. Delicious stuff."
12093,1136061,"Pale tawny colour. Medium (+) nose with caramel, toffee, roasted hazelnut, caramelized orange peel, honey and coffee. Medium taste of caramel, honey, toffee, coffee, roasted hazelnuts,orange peel and mint. Medium (+) long and sweet finish. Medium acidity. Medium (+) body. A very good Colheita that has developed over the few days since the bottle was opened and lost much alcohol taint. Drink now or over the next five years. Goes well with caramel or nut based desserts."
12094,1136061,"4.0 89p. Rather complex with brown sugar, wood and fading fruit in the background. Good acidity.  10"

12103,1136061,More complexity with citrus notes and balanced bitterness

12106,1240414,"A really enjoyable oak-aged VR Alentejano Touriga Nacional, this is very good indeed, a great example of what Alentejo is capable of.  Med ruby. Plump, ripe & soft w. black & red cherry, blueberry, crème de mure, elderberry & creamy vanillin. Well-integrated oak spice, violet floral notes, garrigue & anise. Developing.  Dry. M+ alc, high acid & m+ ripe tannins. Robust w. black cherry, blackcurrant, blackberry & damson. The m+ finish is well done, ripe & well fruited w. a complex note of leafy cured meat."
12107,1240414,Had cold at lunch. Quite a revelation but very hot at the winery so understandable  Still powerful bouquet of herbs even at the lower temperature 
12108,1240414,Lovely balanced and structured wine using Portugal’s native grape! Spice and chocolate benefits so well from its oak ageing.  
12109,1240414,"Very nice Alentejo Touriga Nacional. Dark red color. On the nose cassis, dark red fruits like cherry and prune with hints of chocolate. On the palate well balanced, elegant with again red fruits, chocolate and herbal notes."

12119,1240414,"Bold, smooth and fruity. Recommend you try this variety. "
12120,1240414,"Quite good with very polished savory fruit, very drinkable and balanced. Not so seductive on the palate, specifically the finish, otherwise this would be a great wine. But it is very good..."
12121,1393914,"Last two from Ramos Pinto. This is a single Quinta vintage port from Ervamoira, the same site that Ramos Pinto use to produce their 10 year old tawny. Really young and violaceous, even more obviously so than Ramos Pinto's 2014 LBV. Very much in the producer's elegant and balanced style. Ripe red fruit, plum and cherry, with spice, tar, chocolate, liquorice. A lot of concentration and finesse, this is priced at almost the same level as Ramos Pinto's declared vintage years, and I now understand why. Keep. "
12122,1393914,"4.3 for this amazing dark ruby port, with plenty of coffee, chocolate, mature fruits with a good balance and structure and a great long lenght."
12123,1393914,"Well balanced, perfectly sweet. Blackberries and blueberries are killing "
12124,1393914,"90p. Ramos Pinto #2. The '05 Vintage Port was bottled in '07. A premature opening of the bottle! 👁 Tight dark red, almost purple. 👃 Deep fruit, somehow closed at this stage. Canned dark cherries & plums, mixed with dried fruit. Synthetic note of wood varnish. Sweet tobacco.  Rather sharp alcohol sensation. 👅 Intense & complex; rich fruit. Convincing mouthful. Long-lasting, slightly bitter, finish. 🎯 Fine Vintage Port, but not yet fully developed. Potential for more, save it 5-10y or more!"
12125,1393914,"This is exactly what I expect from a port wine. Extremely balanced and smooth. Acidity and sweetness perfectly in tune, delivering beautiful hints of raisins, confited berries and pomegranate molasses, a timid note of coffee closing. Outstanding!"
12126,1393914," red fruit plum black fruit Fruktig,"
12127,1393914,No notes taken.
12128,1393914,"Blackberry, raisin, blackcurrant, chocolate, red cherry on the nose. M+ body. Medium tannins. Blackberry, blackcurrant, raisin and vanilla on the palate."
12129,1393914,"Decanted for over an hour... wow. The flavours in here are ridiculous. Hidden away since '94, it's something special. Plum, blackberry, jam, and some spice - very warming. One of the classical years, apparently!"
12130,1393914,"Probably my best experience with a Port. Shared with friends (with the distancing measures), we succeeded with the rule for Vintage Ports of ""the bottle shall not touch the table once opened"". Incredibly smooth. Full in flavours and with different tastes and nuances but not intense nor liqurous.  Aromas of fresh red forest fruits. Orange peel. All sorts of nuts: raw, toasted and caramelised. Cocoa, chocolate, toffee, coffee. Vanilla. Honeys. In mouth, pure delicacy. Thin velvet, almost silk. Equilibrium."
12131,1393914,"Good vintage Port, fruity, high tannins but well integrated, aromas of dried grapes, dried prunes, red fruit, oak . Long finish. 3.4"
12132,1393914,Call it a 4.3 night dark colour with a violet rim. Herbal notes on the nose with brine and a farmyard tang developing. Smoother and lighter than the lbv with a very long finish. Fig and raisin notes up front with a cranberry hit on the finish.
12133,1393914,"Deep burgundy color, smells of blackberry, blueberry, India ink and graphite, full body with round mouthfeel, tastes of dried fig, dried persimmon, current, Thompson raisin, cigar box and dark chocolate, complex and long finish, quite sweet but oh so yummy, hitting its sweet spot now!"
12134,1393914,Yes. Very good. 
12135,1393914,Almost perfect. More elegance than most even though still young. Pricey though.
12136,76372,"Yesterday occasionally remove that wine from list. Now post that ideal port again.  Balance, tannins, test, aroma everything perfect and my year!"
12137,76372,A piece of heaven for #winelover
12138,76372,I had promised to drink it when getting a promotion and I got it but for 4 years I forgot opening this bottle. I am glad I did it wit the person I made the promise with. She passed away one year later but I am glad she enjoyed it with me. It an incredible Port wine. For meditation. No matter where you are always remember the good moments in life! Cheers
12139,76372,"Okay now, no more comments. This port just beats... Everything! I wish i could show you the richness of the nectar's havane color, the lavishness of its pale sunset brown...  the scent and taste are so complex, both built with so many antagonist sensations, that it is almost impossible to descibe... An explosion of toffee, caramelized almonds, smoked nuts, burnt chocolate and coffee, tarte tatin... Gosh i wish there was some aged stlilton on board! Or a dark chocolate tart :(:(:( Qatar airways, you rock!"
12140,76372,"Dried fig, nuts and currant, with a toffee ending. Terrific. Bit tough to find and a bit pricey at $150."
12141,76372,This is one of the best! 
12142,76372,"Not a big port fan, but this one could convert me!  Same year from when I was born!  Makes me want to invest in aging some port!"
12143,76372,"Golden amber color, thick, oil-like fluid in the glass. Sultanas, dried tropical fruits, honey infused almond and walnut with spicy dark chocolate. Extremely complex, smooth, endless finish. "
12144,76372,"Super Bock, super star, gets you more pissed than Stella Artois"
12145,76372,Good really good but at 3x the price of 1998 port not sure it is worth it Fruity finish yummy but I would put my money on the 1998
12146,76372,Yeah this is awesome!
12147,76372,"Toffee, butterscotch, dried fruits. Super smooth, pale reddish brown, long finish. Good stuff!"
12148,76372,"1/2 bottle of this. Sweet with toffee, caramel, honey note. A hint of saltiness too. Fabulous!"
12149,76372,"40 year old gem: Sweet creamy port with cocoa and coffee notes, thick luxuriating body that wraps licorice-like plums around your palate and tongue; accompanying my cheese platter supremely well! @ Qatar business"
12150,76372,"Early birthday present with a Colheita from the year of my birth. Deep aromas of blackberry, figs, caramel and alcohol. Smooth tastes of the same, with a sharper acidity than a 40-year tawny normally sees, which is implied by the bottling age of 2014. A little more nuanced flavors and less acidic and this would have been a five star. "
12151,1198393,"Lovely colheita. Sweet concentrated palate with dried fruit, wood and nuts. Clean and pristine. Seems so much younger than it is."
12152,1198393,Another time machine - lovely port 😊 always a pleasure to taste it 
12153,1198393,95 pts. Brilliant copper. Intens complex dried fig and dates roasted almonds and walnuts. Full body very well balanced and very long finish

12157,1198393,"Very nice and tasty - had a glass with cheese and salami. Taste of caramel, oak and a little smoked. A little thin in the end. Good structure and complex, even it is short is it lovely"

12159,1198393,"Tasted in the Calem ""Experience Room"" - an Amazing Single Harvest Colheita - more fruit forward than the Taylor's 40 year.  Notes of honey, dried fruit, dried cherry, and vanilla.  One of the best Ports I've ever had, even better with the Experience. "
12160,1198393,55 years old- respect! Raisins and mature vanilla tones mixed with the sense of secondary tannins from the barrel. 
12161,1198393,"Splendid Calem Colheita port from 1961. An uplifting experience of dark fruit, nuts and layers of wonderful golden honey. "

12167,1197704,"Tart, fruity and crisp. Peach notes, balanced acidity, has flavour to it and for an extremely low price. Top tip is that it’s cheaper in Lidl (3.50) than the airport (6.50). Not overly memorable and the flavours don’t last long on the palate but nice to drink at the time and incredible value."
12168,1197704,Fruity with smooth finish
12169,1197704,Excellent smooth white. Similar to a Chardonnay. Straw colour. Medium body and taste. I got dried lemon & a touch of vanilla

12182,1459651,A voluptuous rich wine style. Reminds me of a cross between Beaujolais generosity of fruits with a powerful structure of napa cs wines. Dark forest fruits nose with some dried spices and herbs. Fun to explore more wine grapes that I don't normally drink. Drinking this reminds me of how big the wine world is l!!
12183,1459651,Wow the oak aging and the full bold base have made a great marriage. If you like bold Rioja and Malbec you have to try this 4.1 
12184,1459651,Very ripe red fruit with fresh plum and oak. The mouth has very nice and juicy red and black fruit. Excellent value for money.
12185,1459651,"Nice full bodied red with black fruit, red fruit and oak. Definitely let it breathe for at least 30 minutes to let it smooth out. Lovely!"
12186,1459651,"This was an impulse buy.  Smooth, cherry & red fruit, hint of vanilla and oak.  Very nice on it's own or with food. Great with pork or bbq grilled chicken. "
12187,1459651,"Medium bodied medium acid medium to strong tannins. Mix of red and dark fruits: raspberry, plum, red currant, blackberry. Finish with generous oak and vanilla. Great match for grilled meats, pizza, cheese. "

12200,20538,A Dão With not much predicates  but honest and drinkable.
12201,20538,"A very traditional Portuguese producer. This is a blend of 3 varietals, all them popular in Portugal. Quite bodied, with low/medium tannins, medium/high acidity, very dark color. The aroma is of dark fruits like plums. Unripe plums are present in mouth, too. Good wine."
12202,20538,"Great for the price!  Pleasant,  dry,  autumnal and fruity. This wine benefits from breathing a bit before drinking.  We will purchase again next time we shop at Portugalia Marketplace."
12203,20538,Full body and nice structure.  Comp at Sheraton Lisbon.  The white also nice.

12213,91097,"A solid 4. Much more engaging than its flabbier, fruitier brother, their Touriga Franca. A mix of red and black fruit with strong ageing notes of oak, tobacco, cigar, and walnut. Definitely could use some more time on its side to integrate more"
12214,91097,"Vino no. 5 in the Algarve  Another vino verde to accompany a delicious dinner - this one a little heavier than the last, but still full of the ripe tang that you would expect from a juicy green grape "
12215,91097,"What can I say?  This is a good wine for the price.  When opening the cork was immaculate by the way.  Very herbal on the nose with a touch of red fruits.  Tremendously full-flavoured with big soft tannins, dry red fruits....maybe a few black ones too.  Very dry finish!  Portugal frequently surprises me with quality to price and age ability.  $28.99/bottle and 11 years old, yet although softened, still tastes young."
12216,91097,Solid! Needs time though.

12234,2362046,"Fab-u-lous. Tasted in Alentejo with local meats and cheeses. Salty, off dry, superb. Can complement any cheese including strong blue.  Slight acidity but well managed. Cost about €13. Will seek out at home. "
12235,2362046,"Here is the ""easy"" white of Susan Esteban, who leads his winery in Alentejo with old vineyards located at 700 m above sea level. Fresh nose with delicate citrus and green apple hints. As said, not a complex wine, but very fresh, easy and enjoyable one. Palate is fresh with a salty moderate finish. 14/20."
12236,2362046,"Crispy, light, drinkable, but not perfect"
12237,2362046,"Soft & tropical fruit, was great with shellfish "

12241,1143310,"Surprisingly complex, muscat like wine. Lots of florality and fresh grape on nose. Mouthfilling apricot and fresh grape with a hint of citruses. Medium acids on finish. Correct ""lady style"" wine."
12242,1143310,"A Passendale beer glass containing a dry white wine that has a darker shade of yellow colour. In the nose it displays lime, minerals, and white flowers. In the mouth, this wine shows a fresh acidity and flavours of stonefruit and minerals.  Pair with shrimp bobó."

12246,1143310,Very well balanced.
12247,1143310,Fresh and smooth. Gentle acidity and notes of apple and gooseberries.
12248,1143310,"Drank this with a spicy, self-caught cod. Yes, self-caught. Solid bouquet with plenty of promise. Heavy, citric taste with a heavy ,spicy and long lasting aftertaste. Can compete with many reds in character and depth."
12249,1143310,"Surprisingly floral.  Blindly tasted it and was convinced it was a chenin blanc or a particularly floral sauvignon blanc. Nove balance, without being overly sweet ."
12250,1143310,Full to medium body. Surprisingly good consentration for it's price. Ripe lemon and lime with a floral note.
12251,1143310,"Generic and nothing really to write home about. Quite herbal and floral with little bitterness in the finish, good acidity. Compromise achieved though: great fish 🐟 unspoiled."
12252,1143310,"Nice one, and a little different. Mellow tongue, good balance with clear taste of pineapple juice and a little mango (?). I will try it again in the summer, together with grilled seafood."
12253,1143310,Excelente custo beneficio 
12254,1143310,"One of the most inexpensive I have bought in a while. Let's see if this is one of those Portugese bargain bottom shelf wines! On the nose immediately what I would call ""white wine""! Typical ""generic"" aromas that I get in inexpensive Italian whites. Flowers, freshly cut grass, some more green notes, almost bitter like dandelions and fresh herbs. Then more tropical fruit like pineapple and cantaloupe. On the palate more of the same, with an medium acidity. Uncomplicated and refreshing! But rather dull."
12255,1143310,"Lovely sweet but watered down notes. Offers a nice easy drinking wine but with a fair bit of complexity. Ripe fruit, maritime, white raisin and a dusting of spear mint on the nose, but the palate is bold with mellowed sweetness, soft fruits, apple and a crisp finish"
12256,1229391,"Has a good nose, reminds champagne wines. Very refreshing body. He a bitter note that stays for a while on the lower mouth. Not so easy to drink, rather strong for a white wine."
12257,1229391,"(EN) Citrus fruits with some acidity.  Good value for money. (PT) Vinho de entrada do Perdigão, com um paladar interessante, mas tem que ser bebido muito fresco."
12258,1229391,So they make bad wine in Alentejo after all.  Nose of sulphur and gasoline. Palate confirmed the nose. 
12259,1229391,Very good... would have again...
12260,1229391,"Citrus, coconut, butter aroma and taste. Medium acidity, lean body and mild flavours. Great with fish from Madeira. 3.5⭐️"

12265,76102,Used very successfully to wash down delicious prawn linguine/tuna steaks at bar do Fundo at Praia grande . Light yet wonderfully aromatic and balanced . Great value . 
12266,76102,Medium body with pear and citrus aromas. Balance acidity and dry.
12267,76102,"87/100 Made from Encruzado, Bical, Malvasia Fina. This is a fresh Dão white made in stainless steel. This has a pure Malvasia flavor. Notes of white flower, acacia, white pear, and lemon. Crisp and clean, this has some weight from the Malvasia but finishes clean and bone dry. Simple and easy."
12268,76102,So smooth. Fruity. Pairs well with bbq ribs. 
12269,76102,"fruity and fresh, perfect on a summer day melon pineapple honey green apple minerals tropical"

Big notes of oxidized strawberry, pomegranate, and cola spice on the palate. Somme bitter cocoa notes on a med finish. Light and fun sipping wine. "
12282,1911299,Pretty much the same as before the Touriga Nacional leads the blend on the value driven Portuguese Red.  Deep ruby/garnet in color with notes of fruit jam and thyme.   Medium bodied with concentrated fruit that bombs the palate  The mouthfeel has low to medium tannin structure and low acidity making for a chewy fruit forward wine   On the palate it’s plum and pepper spice with hints of dried herbs  85pts

12310,3427903,"Very easy drinking white, wine , fruity, with a nice bouquet and delicate."
12311,3427903,Not all its cracked up to be.
12312,2306781,"👍 ES90 RP88 AD91. Rare 100% Moscatel Galego Roxo, Muscat clone grown at Península de Setúbal, Portugal. Unoaked. Riedel Riesling glass release better notes at nose than Zalto white wine glass. 13% alcohol. Buena 10/2020 "
12313,2306781,"Muscat is muscat, that's it.There are infinite varieties around the world and all very recognizable from the first sip: muscat 😉. According to the producer, this one - M. Roxo from the Setúbal peninsula - is rare, even threatened with extinction. Noted, thanx 👌  For me this is just a good, elegant dry muscat. The aromatic characteristics of the grape are present but discreet. The bouquet is delicate, with notes of rose, dried apricot and rosemary. The mouth is fresh and enveloping, with a rich finish"
12314,2306781,"This wine is a limited edition, created with Moscatel Galego. Great wine. I highly recommend it. "
12315,2306781,Loved. Visited winery outside lisbon. Nice non sweet white.
12316,2306781,"A 'white from purple' you might say, billed as a limited edition from one of the world's rarest grapes and one that was even at risk of extinction: Moscatel Galego Roxo, in this case - unusually - non-fortified and youthful (a 2017 tasting December 2017; 13% abv). Ridiculously aromatic, heady, sweet-scented summer grass, meadow, elderflower, perfume, peach, melon, orange citrus, tropical fruit juice. Arguably could become cloying, but hey, lovely as a €1.25 5cl sampler (ok, I purchased two samples)..."
12317,2306781,"Provado no evento 'Vinhos no Pátio'. Vinho branco feito de Moscatel Galego Roxo. Notas florais intensas, algum mel... Em boca é fresco, mineral, com acidez viva e muito saboroso. Um vinho diferente, muito bom. Recomendo.  Tasted in a wine event last Sunday. White wine done with Moscatel Galego Roxo. Intense floral aroma with hints of honey... In the palate it is fresh, mineral, with vibrant acidity and very tasty. A different and very good wine. Recommendable!  "
12318,2306781,"Very aromatic moscatel roxo, bouquet of honeysuckle, lychee, very dry, crisp high acidity, medium body, grapefruit, lime, almost reminiscent of a torrontes style, some minerality and salinity "
12319,2306781,Delicious. Floral notes with a beautiful fruity finish. 
12320,2306781,Dry and elegant. The Moscatel Roxo on the nose is impressive 
12321,2306781,"Distinctive hints of peach, strong 3.5"
12322,2306781,"Dry Muscat, quite powerful and a decent QPR. Nose of roses and geranium, palate very dry, tense and mineral. Good aromatic length. Nice wine !"

12324,2306781,A white like nothing I've ever tasted.
12325,2306781,"Smell: lily, lychee honey.Taste: More pear & aloe than lychee, pineapple & mango. It's dry, light, leaving a bitter aftertaste. Friendly price, easy drinking."
12326,2306781,Expected exuberance found discreet elegance...
12327,2375770,Wow. Chilled naturally sparking red wine from Portugal. Stunning with our locally smoked spiced pork and ham sandwich made on the premises. Come here if your ever in Porto. The  wife decided to have a few extra glass's. 
12328,2375770,"nose: yeast, berries, red currant, cherry, raspberry, just ripe. flavor: red berries, red fruit, medium acidity, medium alcohol. quality: good. pairs well with salty focaccia, chicken pancetta."
12329,2375770,"Mineral taste, but not too sweet. Smell before tasting "
12330,2375770,Very interesting earthy flavors with a glimpse of berries to start with 
12331,2375770,Super refreshing! A good medium for bubbly lovers and red wine lovers. Dry
12332,2375770,Must be served super cold! One of the best sparkling reds around (like me)....I swear I reviewed this!
12333,2375770,"Young and fresh. Playful bubbles! Pear, peaches and orange blossom. Yeast touches. Nicely balanced. "
12334,2375770,"Deep purple colour. Raisin, yeast and sweet popcorn on the nose. Dry, low acidity, quite big bubbles. Finish with strawberry jam note. "
12335,2375770,"Red sparkling from Bairrada, Portugal!  The mighty Baga grape. Dark red colour, seductive perfume of violets, strawberry, raspberry, black pepper. You would expect a gentle and fruity taste, but it is bold with heavy chewy tannins (stalks still in there?), some forest fruit but also tar and bacon. Let's not forget the high acidity level. And did I already mention it is a sparkling wine? Can't say I like it but this wine leaves me with so many questions. 🤔👍🏼"
12336,2375770,Portugese and champagne-like drink is in this case not a good mix.  Celebrating new year on Madeira gave real fireworks that this bottle could not match.
12337,2375770,Light nose of berries. Dry. Light despite being a dark red sparking wine
12338,2375770,Great w leitao. (suckling pig) perfect match
12339,2375770,"Dark purple color, similar to Lambrusco, thick mousse; ripe grape aroma,some cherry, not much a nose - served cold; slight tannic on the pallet, soft mousse, nice acid, tannic finish.... having it at oldest restaurant in Porto, Flor congRegados, roasted pork and smoked ham. Great experience. "
12340,2375770,Pairing with roasted piglet. But could be better...
12341,2375770,It was a gift. I’m not crazy about any red sparkling wines. It has a nice amount of bubbles but still a bit dry for my taste.
12342,1380962,"Light golden yellow color. Aroma and tastes of fresh peaches, pears, honey, apricot. Soft sweetness combined with soft refreshing acidity. Enjoyable desert wine. GVFM. "
12343,1380962,"Concentrated ruby color with aromas of ripe black raspberries, baked prune, sweet spice, tobacco and some floral tones in perfect harmony with some toasted wood scents from the oak. Expressive on the palate , with fine acidity and a pleasant fruity aftertaste. The finale is long , complex and has a chocolatey touch!"
12344,1380962,"Medium to full bodied. Optimal drinking window 2014-2015, but will manage now; 2017. Rich but juicy. Taste of Cranberries. "
12345,1380962,Up front and personal. Has excellent structure and depth with earth and some oak. Is a little thick on the end. Needs to open. Pair with meat that has some sweet and fat properties. 
12346,1380962,"Sour cherries, high alcohol content, and water. Kind of weak for a Cali red blend but not terrible for the price.  "
12347,1380962,Dry but ends well.
12348,1380962,"Smooth easy drinker for a Portuguese Douro. Tinta Roriz led blend, blackcurrant, hint of black pepper and herbs. Silky smooth tannins. Excellent value"
12349,1380962,Good value red Douro. Licorice. Red fruit. Cherry. Blackberry. Green pepper. Black pepper. Slightly toasted wood. Wood spice. Bit of cream. Med acidity. Full body. Med+ to long finish.
12350,1380962,"Ruby with purple hues and notes of ripe cherry, plum, cassis & damson. A medium plus body, medium acidity, medium plus tannins and a long finish make this a pleasant drop. "
12351,1380962,"A very complex red, far too young at this stage. Neither the alcohol, nor the barrique destroy the experience,  a very elegant wine."
12352,1380962,"3.8. This was good for, now $8, was previously $10. But a bit sour.  Fruit forward and full without jammy. Cherry like. Low tannin but not sugary. Good for burgers and strong beef like broccoli beef. Good for home and close friends. "
12353,1380962,"Finally had the opportunity to open the Magnum bottle I received from my sister and her husband (Bianca & Pedro Henrique) as part of the invitation for their wedding in April. They had a nice inscription done as can be seen in the picture. Very nice wine, and the fact that I decanted it for 30 min before made it even better. "
12354,1380962,"Classic 3 way Douro blend made from Tinta Roriz (60%), Touriga Nacional (25%) & Touriga Franca (15%). Has been aged for 9 months in a mix of new & 1 year old barrels and has developed beautifully. Naunces of mixed dark fruit, tobacco leaves & wet earth after rain. Tannins are medium plus on a full bodied palate with a long finish. Amazing paired with fillet steak cooked in garlic butter."
12355,1380962,"Deep clear purple in color. Very intense flavors, such a mix that it's hard to tell the grapes from one another. Short legs though."
12356,1380962,"Full bodied. High acidity. Dark cherry, raspberry, tobacco and toast on the palate. Jammy. Lively acids. Medium length finish."
12357,1177824,"slighty artificial taste of berries, still good for the price!"
12358,1177824,"Light and fruity. Red berries, a bit pepper and hint of oak. Nice price, ugly bottle, would never have bought it my self, because of the bottle. But now i'm positive:)"
12359,1177824,"The Alan Partridge of wines. This one demonstrates the classic characteristics of red fermented grape juice. Funny enough the presence of such a sexy wine is cause to celebrate as if one was going to the Longstanton Spice Museum, or having an important discussion about the pedestrianisation of Norwich city centre which is a topic we should all consider while tasting this wine. Oh dear there’s Dan. "
12360,1177824,"On the  bouquet with dark woodland berries, soft roasted almonds and exotic spice tones. Offers good velvety- juicy and ripe fruit extraction as well as coffee bean scents, fresh mixed Mediterranean herbs and a whiff of vanilla. Great length and concentration on the aftertaste. That’s a good  and attractive value wine!"
12361,1177824,"Powerful dark purple-red color in the glass! On the nose with a bouquet of dark berry fruits, delicate toasted aromas and exotic spices! On the palate velvety-dense and juicy-ripe fruit, fine coffee notes, fresh herbs with a hint of vanilla in the concentrated finish! Cheers!"
12362,1177824,"Nase: blackberry, dates Palates: dark chocolate, tobacco, Oak, smoke"
12363,1177824,"Sweet like blackcurrant, joyful aftertaste of ripening dark fruits. Cheerful and made to be enjoyed young, with the irresistible longing for a chilly evening when you can cuddle in someone's loving arms."
12364,1177824,"a lovely blend 50% Touriga National, 25% Aroganez, 15% Cabernet, & 10% Syrah. Smooth & fruity overall. Great with food & excellent on its own. A crazy 15% alc. however unnoticeable throughout. & most definetily an odd name for this Portuguese Alentegano red. I've enjoyed from the 1st time trying it a wine over twelve years ago. Disliked the name & I knew wine snobs would dislike it (perfect)."
12365,1177824," Compota de frutos do bosque, amoras negras, chocolate, cacau, cor rubi opaco, final longo, seco e agradável."
12366,1177824,"Dark red color almost black. Dark berries, vanilla, blackberry, blueberries and black currant on the nose.  Blueberries, herbs, vanilla, pine, blackberry and plum on the palate. Very good tasty wine 🍷 "
12367,1177824,Weird label but surprisingly decent. 
12368,1177824,"Deepest purple with a potent nose, this one is almost crawling out of the glass. It packs a serious punch of fruits - finishing a bit like a spirit. Interesting."
12369,1177824,Round and easy drinkable. Hints of licorice and dark chocolate on the palate. Enjoyed during the Norwegian Labor Day. Cheers 🍷
12370,1177824,"Yes, you buy the brand, but it's not that bad anyway. Nice taste of ripe berries. "
12371,1177824,Was @devinewinesEDM looking for something to go with BBQ ribs. He suggested Sexy. Said it was horrible label but good wine. So often people buy nice labels and poor wines. Fruit forward wine. Better with simple meats rather than spicy.
12372,1187604,"4.4. Great mature vintage port. Color is brown/red. Nose shows raisins, plum, dark bread, molasses, walnuts, hazelnuts caramel, curry powder, pepper and other spices. On palate there is a certain alcoholic warmth and spiciness with an incredible length.   "
12373,1187604,"32 years old, very subtle and not so sweet. A lot of red wine feeling, but with the Port touch. "
12374,1187604,"Great Porto! Delicate nose with notes of coffee and nuts, on the palate stood out, fat and greedy, and in half a bottle!  Grande Porto! Nariz delicado com notas de café e frutos secos, no palato destacou-se, gordo e guloso, e em meia garrafa!"
12375,1187604,"30yrs old, needed to breathe, bold, not too sweet, fig"
12376,1187604,20 years old and still with pungency oaky round tannins mature plums great deep spiciness long lasting end.
12377,1187604,"Good port. Nice to open a 15 year old bottle. I am not a port specialist and dont have a huge basis for comparison. I felt this was drier that my prior experiences, but with all the sweet tangyness of port. It was chic."
12378,1187604,Rescued this  from my parents basement. It's a Tawny so no vintage but it's at least 30 years old and has matured nicely.
12379,1187604,"Dark black color, chocolate and figs and caramel nose, medium and fresh berry taste with a powerful loooooong taste , very nice "
12380,1187604,"Note:94  Color:Tawny color,like the 20 year old.Orange highlights  Nose:Elegant and light,hibts of yellow fruit and orange marmelade.  Palate:Soft and sweet.Significant warmth,but not hot.Port jelly.Faint acidity and some good tannins.Slightly caramelized simple syrup.  Finish:Very soft and sweet orange rind, could also be called orange marmelade.Surprisingly long 3-4 minutes at least."
12381,1187604,"Aging beautifully! Rich coffee notes, dried raspberries and strawberries. "
12382,1187604,Only one of 36k bottles. Thanks Don Sebastio Lagos. 
12383,1187604,Profund  yellow. Note of Caramel and berries. Balanced
12384,76101,"Excellent. Blueberry jam and oak low tannins, very refreshing wine. Low acidity, long aftertaste. Definitely worth coming back to explore more"
12385,76101,"Clear, medium ruby Clean, pronounced blackberry, black currant, raspberry, herbs, licorice, pepper, floral High acid, medium tannins, medium alcohol, medium intensity blackberry, black currant, pepper, herbs, licorice, medium finish"
12386,76101,Earthy with high red points of red currant.  I detected kalamata olive along with a hint of balsamic. Well done!
12387,76101,"It has a lovely ruby colour, with a bouquet of violet and black fruits, as well as notes of spices and oak. Its palate is a fine balance of all the components with an elegant finish. Went perfect with the lasagna."
12388,76101,"Light but high aromatic wine, soft tannins, good acidity, very drinkable "
12389,76101,So well balanced. This is what wine should taste in one's mouth. Or is it because I've grown up in the Dão region? Love it and don't need to think about it. Try it yourselves. Give it a chance. 
12390,76101,"Notes of oak, black fruit and earthy on the nose. On the palate, notes of blackberry, cherry and a hint of chocolate. It was much smoother than I expected and the flavors blended well. A deep burgundy color in the glass, and on the dry side. Very acidic but overall I enjoyed it "
12391,76101,"Supermarket series, Dao region. I tasted the 2014 version and decided to buy it again, let’s see if they made improvements.  👃 rich and hot, lots of pepper, oak, leather, dark chocolate and full of cherry and cranberry, a really pleasant aroma, it invites you to take a big sip 🤣🤣.  🍷 simple, light bodied, elegant, a bit sweet but at the right spot, good tannins and a modest aftertaste. "
12392,76101,Cherry and black fruits. Some baking spices. Decent
12393,76101,"Good, but apparently you can get this for $4 vs $12"
12394,76101,"Animal, réglisse, cuirette."
12395,76101,"Bloody lovely, warm sexy mare, worth adoring x"
12396,76101,Bold and fruity with oaky last touch on palate 
12397,76101,"Well balanced, no hard tannins. Good value!"
12398,76101,Once aerated the flavors come to life.  A little on the acidic side for me but the deep dark berries with peppery undertones really come through.  A full bodied red that I will definitely buy again.  
12399,1172735,"Good Portugese wine. Blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Some oak and nice tannins. Drinked with a good beef. Good aftertaste "
12400,1172735,"Crude, tannic, dusty in the nose. Opens up beautifully after an hour. Deep red, nice acids and good structure. Ripe cherries."
12401,1172735,"Gorgeous nose on this wine! Dark ruby colour. Nose is reminiscent of a good sangiovese or bordeaux. Red and dark stone fruit, lush red fruit, leather, oak, cedar, liquorice, warm acidic soil. Sadly not all this carries over to the palate. Medium body. The overwhelming nuanced fruit on the nose is toned down. Dry, firm finish. Still a bargain, considering the price!"
12402,1172735,"Nice medium minus purple color. Good Dao blend with fresh fruit. Raspberry, cherry, vanilla and oak, medium (+) body and integrated tannins. Fresh acidity. Medium long and dry finish. Good balance. Very good QPR. 3,8 87/100"
12403,1172735,"Very interesting new discovery. I can smell the Dao landscape of vineyards crammed in between the forests and hills. The wine is soft and sunny, but it also has a spicy edge, som eucalyptus and tar. Very nice indeed. "
12404,1172735,"Beautifull deep red. Needs some air to open up. Dark forrest berries, plum, some oak and vanilla.  Bold, dry, present tannins. Wonder how they will integrate over the next 5 years.  Well balanced. Best with a good meal. "
12405,1172735,"Velvety tannins and smooth. Would fit with cheese, chicken, pork. Typical concrete tank feeling. Will buy later"
12406,1172735,Very tasty light red wine. 
12407,1172735,"Organic and unoaked blend from Dão, black fruits, wax hints, impressive power in a robust body, rough tannins and medium end."
12408,1172735,Light but rich. Fruity.
12409,1172735,Dark red color.  black fruit in the nose.  Dry  blackberry vanilla on the tounge.

12413,1172735,Not so much there... but good enough for enjoying on a Tuesday night! 
12414,1151644,"Delicious Douro. Decent price and a smooth easy taste most would find very pleasant. Add this to the cellar, especially 2018. Just damned good!"
12415,1151644,"Excellent Douro red wine that went great with the salmon, was a hit with my hot 29 year old GF, loaded with blackberries and oak. A definite 2nd buy. "
12416,1151644,"Blackberry, huckleberry, hoisin, five spice, tobacco, hazelnut, marjoram.... wonderfully complex and savory without loosing the essence of the fruit. Balanced but edgy. This wine is a masterpiece but interestingly best right after corking"

12422,1151644,"(4.0) Fresh and complex Douro. Intense opening with ripe fruit with flavours of plum, boysenberry and light oak. Medium to full body.  Some minerals appears accompanied with soft tannins during persintent ending.  "
12423,1151644,"Beautiful deep raspberry colour, following with more raspberries on nose. Well balanced barrel with tones of cozy vanilla. Fresh even with the oak, almost a frizzante feeling on the tongue. Highly enjoyable. "
12424,1151644,"Superb with steak and peppercorn sauce. Enjoyed in Portugal. Plum, vanilla, cherry flavours."

12429,1785564,"Ripe fruits in the nose :banana, quince melon, orange and wax with minerality. Mouth slightly salty with citrus. Light, clear, refreshing with medium body and long, slightly salty finish. "
12430,1785564,"Portugal 3/30 Vineyards were first introduced in the 16th century and Anselmo Mendes Magma is all about retrieving that historical legacy. This wine is 100% produced from Verdelho-grapes. 5 months bâtonage. Fruity style with character, 3.2⭐️"
12431,1785564,"Interesting, light and delicate, quite short and crisp. Will certainly be a better wine in future releases. "
12432,1785564,"Decent baking hot day wine, sappy and zesty but to me, a bit lacking in body and depth. "
12433,1785564,"Soft golden glimpse, in cristal clear wine. Notes of citric and melon aromas, a slight bit of walnut. Medium long grapefruit taste with a nice mineral undertone touch of green rope figs and a salty breeze... Just great! "
12434,1785564,"Balanced acid , pineapple, butterscotch, brioche, experienced with Helaghocker cheese . 6/10/21 - recommend by Richard at FC "
12435,1785564,"Complex smell with apple melon  mineral dandelion little lemon freshness, taste good body medium acidity with salty lemony taste. "

12437,1785564,"I rated over 100 Portuguese wines, but this is the first one from Açores. 🇵🇹 And it’s an interesting one, also a difficult one to describe! It’s mineral, and that’s the word that characterises it best.  The aroma is subtle and mineral-driven, giving additional hints of citrus fruits. Lots of minerality on the palate too, backed up by refreshing lemony acidity and pinch of salt. Great balance and overall a pleasure to sip on its own, although it was equally enjoyable with seafood paella."
12438,1785564,"Different! Deep orangey colour but lighter mouthful than expected. Salt, acidity, orange zest, dried herbs, minerality. Hints of a Fino sherry. From a Verdelho! And it's from the Azores (not the Duoro). "
12439,1785564,"Great wine made in the Azores by Anselmo Mendes. Very fresh, with green apple, melons and unripe pineapple on the nose, with a light sea breeze. Great acidity, with citrus and apples, along with minerals and a rocky, earthy touch. Top."

12444,22317,"Very good Baga with perfumed and damson nose, well balanced elegant"
12445,22317,"17/20, 93/100. Black cherry, plums, blackberry, resin, oak, chocolate, black pepper. Dry, with medium alcohol, high tannins, high acidity and medium body. Very impressive. "
12446,22317,"93/100 Current release of this wine made from ungrafted vines of Baga. The yields are very low, only one bunch per vine. Tasted this side by side with the 2015 vintage. This is eerily similar to the younger vintage and doesn't show a lot of development. Mostly mountain berry and white pepper. The tannins are a tad rounder and more fine grained than the 2015. The condition of this bottle suggests that there may be lots of life left in the cellar. "
12447,22317,"Once again a beautiful example of the great potential of Bairrada wines, this red made again by Luis Pato ""king of Baga"" focusing on old vines, it is mature, rich and round a blend 50/50 of Baga and Touriga Nacional, a beautiful structure and complexity "
12448,22317,"The producer's dream, 20 years ago, was to create a wine that demonstrated how pre-phylloxeric wines were.  He planted vines of the Baga variety, directly, as was used in pre-phylloxera Europe, in sandy soil.  You need six vines to get one single bottle of this wine. Powerful aroma of ripe red fruits. In the mouth is fairly full, with polished tannins and excellent acidity. Very long finish. A fantastic wine. "
12449,22317,"The alluring nose feels fresh with a bouquet of tobacco- enriched plum fruit and some autumn leaves. The palate entry has an earthy / tannic concentration , vintage leather scents,mocha,saline dried cherries, smoked beef , orange rind and eucalyptus touches joining too with further aeration. Good silky mouthfeel with lovely tertiary notes and a superb balance and excellent , impressive length!   "
12450,22317,"Very interesting, a. If wine that needs hours to open up. Tasted the next day and it became a whole different wine, finesse, softened tannins and great balance."
12451,22317,A wine with too much personality. Full bodied and very much concentrated and complex. A very special Portuguese red wine!
12452,22317,For the money I wonder when it will stop to get better and better? Baga from Luis Pato... A master....
12453,22317,"Someone in the know told me to try Luis Pato wines when I go to Portugal. That was very good advice indeed. This wine is smoothly tannic with hints of black and dried  fruit, leather, tobacco, and dry chocolate. Very elegant and well-balanced, reminiscent of high quality Crianzas but more approachable (no need to decant for hours). At less than EUR 18, it offers very good QPR."
12454,22317,Great wine by Mr. Baga (Eng. Luis Pato) Amazing
12455,22317,Exquisite. Delicate and elegant yet full of life
12456,22317,Amazing. Very complex. Fruit. Flower. Structed. Large. Final elegant acidity.
12457,22317,"Four up tonight, a great northern red, full body great taste"
12458,22317,"4,0 ⭐. Blind tasted, I wish this Baga red by iconic Luis Pato would've had time to properly decant, as it improved a lot in the glass.   Fresh crisp cassis on the nose, with hints of menthol & a ghost of medicinal herbs.  Mid body feel, super crispy rusty acidity & mature yet spiced tannins.  Crisp juicy mouthwatering palate with crisp juicy yogurt flavored cherry, strawberry, tar, medicinal herbs & stems.  Possible uprate if enjoyed in a calmer setting with more time."
12459,1151651,"Portugal 18/30 Last out from CARM was this Grande Reserva. DOC Douro, 85% Touriga Nacional, 10% Touriga Franca, 5% Tinta Roriz and 12 months on new French oak. Blackberries, licorice, vanilla, cedar wood. Firm tannins. 4.1⭐️ Drink 2021-2031"
12460,1151651,90 points - dark purple; good body; little fresher than typical Douro red.
12461,1151651,"Smoke, caramel and milk. Well balanced tannins on a long and lasting after taste. Mouthwatering wine. Will improve with age, although this 2014 is fully ready for immense pleasure. "
12462,1151651,"For Touriga Nacional this is very nice. Not so much on the nose but strong yet silky tannins on the palate, which is slightly acidic and dry. The finish though is long, full of delicious dried plum, vanilla, and other assorted goodness."
12463,1151651,"Deep purple red colour. Dry. Medium-strong levels of acidity. Mouth watering juiciness. Full-bodied big red bottle of wine. Tannins are present but not overpowering. On the nose, oak (French new barrel), smoke, red berries like blackberry, Moreno cherry. Taste is similar that of black fruit, red fruit, plum, berries and mineral. Overall a very nice bottle of wine to enjoy with red meets or on its own."
12464,1151651,4.5. Great lovin it. Yet another beaute alfre🍷🇵🇹!!!  Bought from duty free.    oak vanilla dark fruit chocolate  Bold and brave. Simply elegant and dry. Good mixture of porto grapes. From Douro.   Drinking again.   🍷🍷🍷🍷
12465,1151651,"Brought this back from The Douro having enjoyed the Reserva over there & the Grande Reserva doesn't disappoint. Deep purple. Wonderful pronounced aroma intensity. Sweet vanilla oak with toasty cinnamon & bitter chocolate. Plump blackberry, black cherry & cassis. Very ripe yet not hot or baked. Dry, rich & with lifted juicy med.+ acidity. Excellent balance. Primary black fruit (black cherry, blackberry, blueberry). Floral (violet) & damson jam. Med.+ fine tannins. Med.+ alcohol. Generous med.+ finish. Great!"
12466,1151651,"Quite dense colour, still youthful with a purple hue. Fine nose here. Gentle hint of new oak. Lot of ripe, dark berry fruit, with cassis, plum and cherry. Mild spiciness as well. Good grip on the palate. I really like this combination of ripe and juicy dark fruit. There is a good brightness on the palate here, fresh acidity and a good presence of minerality as well. Grainy tannin, just a hint of roasted oak. Fine spicy notes and a very long and vibrant finish. A fine wine indeed, but young. 90"
12467,1151651,A rookie with Touriga nacional. Very nice and elegant. Smooth and nicely balanced. Ready to open even though is 2014
12468,1151651,4.5-. Delicious! Plum. Dark fruit. Allspice. Vanilla. Tobacco. Touch raisins. Med acidity. Med+ body. Long finish. This is in a nice place. Tannins are smooth. A couple more years will probably be even better but drinking extremely well right now! Happy Iberuly!
12469,1151651,Full bodied. Too tannic for my taste but still a good wine! I used to have it in the past and i had a better opinion about it. Its still a good wine.  Encorpado. Muito taninico para o meu gosto mas mesmo assim e um bom vinho. Tinha una opiniao melhor mas penso que este 2013 nao e dos melhores anos.
12470,1151651,"Bought 2 bottles 2 years ago. Drank the 1st one during the 2019 Holidays. At the time I enjoyed it, but felt it was a bit closed and too compact. Now about 2 years later my 2nd bottle was much better. Super deep and bright purple, complex nose of both fresh and baked dark fruits. Very balanced and fresh on the palate, with a great density of polished tannins. Lingering flavors of dark cherry, chocolate and a hint of leather. 2015  was a great vintage for Douro reds, could easily have age a few more years."
12471,1151651,"Outstanding  Douro 2010. Combination of Tourigas, Roriz and Francisca resulted on a delicate fresh red after 18 months on American Oak."
12472,1151651,"Has definitely aged very well. Drink it now as it should be pretty much at its peak. Fresh, still somehow youthful on the first impact but then rather short and dry. Good wine for a Douro 2010..."
12473,1151651,Great blend dark fruits berries vanilka notes on nose big finish chocolate hints very smooth
12474,9001,"Beautiful dry, fresh, full bodied, yet light in the mouth. Peaches, white berries and hints of abricots and melon. A pleasant surprise in a bottle. "
12475,9001,"Chais d'oeuvres  Very nice wine with a nice nose and perfect on the palate on minerality ! Only thing, is that it doesnot last."
12476,9001,"4.5⭐️ for this Portuguese Douro 🇵🇹 white wine. 👁 Clear visual with a straw pale color.👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry with citrine and white fruits and a second sniff focused on grapefruit, apple, lemon and mineral. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of mineral and citrine fruits. Good persistence in the mouth with medium finish. Elegance white with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🥂"
12477,9001,"- Visually- medium yellow - Nose- initial stone fruits and tinge of smoke, moves into caramelised apple with honey, vanilla and smoky oak.  - Palate- exquisitely fresh, clean and refreshing. Initially light, then fruity minerality then lingering fruit cocktail with slight fizz.  - Simple wine but excellently done. Enjoyed as aperitif prior to slow roast lamb shoulder."
12478,9001,"We chose to have as dinner, iphoned codfish, portuguese style & drink this great portuguese Douro wine from Nieeport winery to pair it with. Limpid subtile greenish yellow color. Ellegant nose of green apple, pear jam, subtile lemon wrapped in chalk, wet stones & lemongrass notes. In mouth, ellegant & well integrated, fresh, dry & crisp, average plus body, perfectly integrated high acidity delivering gorgeous white pulp fruit flavors with mineral & herbal notes till its lingering finish. Wonderfull. Cheers!"
12479,9001,"Pale yellow color, aromatic on the nose, stonefruits, some apricot, melon gives softness, citrus acidity and very nice minerality. "
12480,9001,Excellent dry white which makes seafood zing off the plate!!
12481,9001,On nose stylish green and fresh floral. Taste nice round full tasting. Not easy drinking. If too cold and not open before lacks lot of nyancess
12482,9001,"Attractive, evolving Douro branco.  Oxidative notes on opening, strident citrus notes. Steadily softened to show a little stone fruit and creaminess on the finish. Nice. "
12483,9001,"Excellent nose: fruity and fresh. A bit disappointing on the palato due being so short. The beginning is very good, but disappear too fast. "
12484,9001,"Ripe fruit on the nose: quince, quince jam, melon, vanilla, mushroom. Medium acidity, medium alcohol (11.5%), medium body, medium (+) finish"
12485,9001,"Complex flavors with hints of toast from the barrels complement the wine‘s distinct floral and delicate character. Notes of spice, tropical fruit, fresh sliced green apple , white blossoms , slate, preserved lemon , sweet herbs and baked quince emerge to form a complex and seductive ensemble. Tight and vibrant on the palate , with some nods and marked acidity, the wine offers elegance and depth. Long lasting finish with a final touch of smokiness and salinity."
12486,9001,"Another vintage of white Redoma, this 2018 has, like the previous vintages, a high standard quality. Freshness & minerality with notes of pear and white peach. Delicious. Excellent with food. A very consistent brand in Douro valley! 4.2pts."
12487,9001,"Another excellent wine from 🇵🇹. Very fine notes of pear lime citrus oak jasmine with a mildly sweet twist. Body was soft, balanced, with moderate acidity and good volume despite the low but refreshing abv. At times funkier twists reminded me of the Greek vidiano but maybe with less barique and mineral characteristics. Pleasant finish probably the weakest part. Really easy going wine for all circumstances. A 4.1"
12488,9001,"Very nice nose, quite dry, notes of melon and citrus. Robust body, can go well with most foods. Since it has good acidity and freshness, it feels light on the palate. Paired it with fresh codfish carpaccio and fish soup."
12489,1394472,"Second bottle. 3,8 and a great Douro QPR and better much better than many other more expensive ones. "
12490,1394472,"A full-bodied red with jam and cherry notes. With so many excellent wines from Portugal it’s good, but not necessarily great. "
12491,1394472,"still good drinkable. red beries, tabac, currant, nuts."
12492,1394472,dark fruit vanilla 
12493,1394472,Tinsy bit sharp to de tongue but... what lovely legs and body.
12494,1394472,Great fruit content
12495,1394472,"85 Aroma had ripe dark fruits, oak and vanilla. Over the palate came boiled berries, vanilla and oak. Medium acidity, medium tannins and dry."
12496,1394472,"Dark berry, liquorice, deep, lightly smokey.  Somewhere between a Lodi Zinf and a Barossa Shiraz (which funkily enough preceded this one by a few glasses)"
12497,1394472,It is just simpl wine. 
12498,1394472,"Dark ruby in colour. Cherry, black currants, blackberries, and jammy notes with hints of vanilla and oak in the aroma. Flavour of warm dark berries, leather, coffee, and vanilla. 85."
12499,1394472,"Dependable Douro.  This wine is not going to disappoint nor is it a standout.  A pleasant aroma of dark fruit, black pepper and vanilla. The dark red colour is very inviting. Bold wine with higher tannins. Dry and spicy in a good way. Fruit is ripe and there is a slight wet oak taste. "
12500,1394472,"In the glass a deep ruby ​​red color.  On the nose intense aromas dominated by blackberries and ripe plums balanced with notes of flowers snd vanilla.  On the palate medium- full bodied with good structure and balance, round and soft in the mouth with nice long aftertaste."
12501,1394472,Dangerously drinkable for a airport lounge 😂 particularly when delayed 😥😫
12502,1394472,Good Douro red. More delicate than the other Douros we tasted. 
12503,1394472,"I sampled the 2012 and it was reasonable - same here. Bright red fruits rather than dark, some under-ripe spiced plum in the mouth and a touch of pepper on and after the finish. Decent tannins suggest you will be able to hold on to it for a while but not convinced it will improve further in the bottle."
12504,3683647,"Very good Portuguese red wine  from Douro  100% Touriga Nacional, a deep dark ruby color  with dark purple background. Nose: intense, black forest berries, balsamic herbs, menthol and eucalyptus, with a lot of smoked and baked meat aromas. In the mouth: wine strong, juicy, with great structure and powerful character, nice fresh tannins and fresh fruity acidity. Finish long and memorable."
12505,3683647,"Typical Portuguese cork with logo of the winery and a red-violet top.  Has a nose for wild fruits and still some alcohol breath - not expected for a 6 years old wine. Strong and expressive palate, 14,5% volume, 100% Turiga nacional - Portuguese most popular grape, ripe fruits, very open tannins, rough but good and persistent aftertaste. Good character but a bit too strong."
12506,3683647,Purple colour with a smooth texture and long finish. I enjoyed this wine. 
12507,3683647,"Very deep rich fruity flavours, hints of port in the background. Would pair well with red meat or a stew"
12508,3683647,Very nice light wine! Slightly fruity great in summertime with some fish dishes. 
12509,3327638,"Red blend made of Jaen, Touriga National, Tinta Roriz and Alfrocheiro from vineyards from altitudes of 600m. Subtle cherries and violets. Fresh with good acidity and some tannins."
12510,3327638,"Very good taste, at first try very dry, later smooth"
12511,3327638,"Épais,  fruité long en bouche, on ressent le soleil super Anne "
12512,3327638,Velvet in taste but overall disappointingly flat
12513,3327638,"Deep purple hue. Raspberry on the nose and tongue. Dry, smooth, super drinkable."
12514,3327638,"Ripe red and black fruit. Plummy, Jemmy, minerally  on the nose.  Full bodied, rich buttery tongue blanket. M- acidity. W vanilla and brown sugar retro. Highly drinkable. Plum, red cherry, chocolate on the pallet. Long woody finish with black peppery aftertaste."
12515,3327638,Dão typical wine. Elegant with fresh fruit.
12516,3327638,Young and fruity. Slight tannic / acidic finish that won't please the untrained drinker. Went well with pizza though!
12517,3327638,Very good taste. Worth the money  
12518,3327638,"great value, solid wine"
12519,3327638,Beautiful wine with soft tannins and lovely fruit. A winner. Saúde!
12520,3327638,"Grape varieties: Jaen, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Alfocheiro."
12521,1189822,97/100. Top rating and five stars from me. Light brown to orange color. Complex nose. Silky texture. So balanced. Long and delicate. My best port ever.  Merry Christmas all Vivino friends out there😃🍷🎄🎁
12522,1189822,"4.6 raw honey, with fig and drier fruits with almonds.  nice caramel amber color with a full mouth feel. cinnamon and cream on taste with oak. "
12523,1189822,"4.1 This may be rather new bottling, but I miss the thertiarry notes. Colour of strawberry compote, nose of dried plum, palate of an oak twig, some sweet chili pepper sauce"
12524,1189822,"I was honestly sort of disappointed. I was expecting a revelatory experience, this wine does have a 4.7 rating. Upon opening the wine the hazy mocha color was revealed. I've never really seen a wine that looked the same as this one. The nose had all of the typical port indicators, Caramel, chocolate, with notes of roasted nuts, butterscotch and coffee. The palate was brimming with flavors like vanilla, chocolate, a box of raisins and dried prunes. The acidity was cutting giving the wine an edge. "
12525,1189822,Tasted like Sultanas and freedom
12526,1189822,Best port I ever had.
12527,1189822,"Fruity, very nice"
12528,1189822,This is silky and elegant and almost feminine. Layers of flavour with dominant orange and bakery characteristics.
12529,1189822,"Since Para was gone, we replaced it with this beautiful Barros and paired with Vaniglia del Madagascar ice cream😍😍 Big cheers my friends🍷🍷"
12530,1189822,Tawny port. Light and smooth
12531,1189822,"Walnut, caramel and dried fruit to mention few. Really deep and complex. Layer and layer after another. Port wine tasting at Barros Porto. Had to get a bottle."
12532,1189822,"My other half’s birth year wine to celebrate her birthday, a pretty awesome nightcap!  Pale brown. A touch heady, needing a few hours to blow off. Raisin, sultana, dried fig, fruitcake & walnut purée. Hazelnut, cream, vanilla & cinnamon buns. Complex w. apricot jam, dried plum, glacé cherry & Demerara sugar. Fully developed.  Sweet. Very rich & creamy w. soft plum jam, Bakewell tart, fruitcake & hazelnut. Wood spice of pepper & nutmeg w. golden syrup & black tea. High alc, m+ acid & a very long waxy finish."

12534,1189822,"Surprising color, light brown with some spark in it. Nose is probably biggest surprise with pleasuring tones of dry fruits, figs, raisins, prunes, apples and honeyed walnuts. It could remind you some great aguardente with an oriental spices. Then the palate is turning you back to wine world with silky and smooth taste, with finish just opening your fantasies."
12535,1189822,"From our stop at Porto city, this unique Twany has a very pale colour. A perfect sweetness and acidity balance, makes it delightful as a dessert. On the nose, oak, black fruit and  raisin notes. On palate,  honey, caramel and raisin notes. Low to medium acidity and a long finish."
12536,1456221,"Degustado em Prova as cegas ""Que Verde é este? Por Coimbra Wine Friends e Portugal Senses."

12538,1456221,(3.6*) Vinho Verde Wine Experience.  Only pictures and rating! 
12539,1456221,"Bright pale straw colour. Youthful and pure nose, some stony notes, young stone fruit, peach, ripe lemon zest and some herbal notes. Very bright palate, mouthwatering and crisp with youthful fruit, crushed peach and pear with citrus, medium weight but flavour intense with a long and lingering finish. "
12540,1456221,White fruit and oak aromas as well as dry fruits. Voluptious mouth and high acidity.
12541,1456221,"Exquisite dry and mineral wine with a pinch of peach in mouth. It pairs very well with any dish that contains ginger, lemon...enjoy!"

12543,1456221,Casa do Lado Lombada
12544,1456221,"Light lemon yellow in the glass.  Asparagus, green pepper and lemon zest in the nose.  Med+ acidity, dry, with notes of hazelnut, brioche, pear and lemon zest in a med- finish with vanilla notes. "
12545,1456221,"A nice complex white. Much bigger than the normal ""vinho verde"". (Green wine)  Note of oak, cedar and green apples. Nice acidity and medium body. Plenty of minerality and personality. Had it with fish stew: wonderful. Paired it with dry aged ham: fantastic. This is the type of white wine that can stand up to a strong meat dish. A small production of 4500 bottles so get some if you run across it."
12546,1456221,I have to give it a 4 star just for the price quality.
12547,1456221,"Interesting aging notes of Alvarinho, some querosen, evolution but keeping a good balance. Lacks some more structure on the palate."
12548,1456221,Vanilla and lemon in the nose. Taste is citrus and oaky.  Great with quail and cod fish soup 
12549,1456221,Light and summery
12550,1456221,This was a little heavier than others 
12551,6278768,"Very enjoyable and subtle Malvasia. A different wine, you feel there may be some sweetness to come that doesn’t really “materialise”. Fruity (citrus and green apple) and good acidity "
12552,6278768,"[Quinta do Portal Winery Visit] This Malvasia Fina monocepage is for me the poster child of the ‘Unlocked’ range. Definitely not for everyone but if you’re open for it, a wonderful discovery. In the mineralic nose beautiful oxidation, lemon and almond while the palate continues the Sherry theme with a dirt dry edge but offers plenty complexity with pronounced acidity, smoke and a freshness very welcome in the Douro thanks to high (~500m) location of the vineyards. 4.1"
12553,2052801,"Fresh and crisp on the nose, nothing specific though. Has a look of chardonnay about it. Tasted apricot, melon. Dry, not acidic, pleasant to drink with and without food. Superb Lidl value. "
12554,2052801,Good clean and crisp in flavour. Superb value for money.
12555,2052801,A bargain €3.80 from Lidl with a pleasing vigornier hint of something a lot more pricey.
12556,2052801,Clean and fresh. Tropical and citrus fruits.
12557,2052801,"My first Antão Vaz, but not the last. It went down easily in one evening. Aromas of sweet tropical fruits, peaches. Medium body. On the palate, there are again tropical fruits but nothing specific that comes to mind. Also some mineral notes along with white peach and galia melon. Ripe and well balanced. Not really acidic but not sweet either. Great value for €5.62"
12558,2052801,"This is Antao Vaz or to us nin Portugese...and my apologies in advance, is the Chardonnay of Portugal, more crisp, super tropical  fruit, clean with no oak treatment. Excellent value at €3.99"
12559,2052801,Seriously smooth good white. Medium or the dry side. Slight hints of lemon & cream. Lovely. 
12560,2052801,Fresco leve optimo para marisco

12562,2052801,Meduim acidic. Peach. Apricot on the nose
12563,2052801,"Fruity dry white wine from Portugal, full of lemon, grass and light herbs flavours with a slightly pretentious crisp at the beginning and lacks full body in the end. Tried with seafood."
12564,2052801,Delicious! Apple flowers and honey nose. Melon and peaches. Lychee. Dry and buttery. 
12565,2052801,Light dry finishes well

12568,7150649,Really nice surprise!!  Alvarinho 🍇 🇵🇹 Lemon + color 👁 . Dry wine with intense flavors of stone fruit peach apricot nectarine 🍑 dried fruit pineapple 🍍 minerals stone citrus 🍊 cream . Nice complexity with a long finish!! A wine made with really smooth yeast!! Wow 🤩 
12569,7150649,crisp apple and minerality with sweetness on the finish. 
12570,7150649,"(3.8) On the heavier side, to be honest. Not the fresh, light, salty and fruity style I’m used to. Interesting to try the regional Lisboa Alvarinho though."
12571,7150649,"Pale straw color with a greenish underlayer. Creamy forward on the nose, graham cracker, but fruity and herbaceous, black currant bud and rose. Very tense on the palate with lots of structure. Sharp acidity and a lingering minerality."
12572,7150649,"Tried at a visit to the Quinta in Jan 2020. Very different from both the Vinho Verde Alvarinho and the Spanish Rias Baixas expressions. Fascinating aroma of white peach and a mouth filling flavour that was lean and dry at the same time. I'm not even sure I liked it, but I know it was fascinating. "
12573,7150649,"Well, once I got over the hernia by lifting the bottle, I poured the wine. Very slightly darker than I expected but not in a way to concern. Beautifully clean and a terrific example of this grape. I really liked this wine but they could lighten the weight of the bottle a tad. "
12574,7150649,"Appears pale gold. Intense citrus, vegetal and stone fruit, tropical aromas. Medium plus acidity. Dry. Moderate body. Alcohol at 13%. Intense flavours of white peach, nectarine, lemon zest, pineapple and minerality. Moderate finish. Very good quality of a unique Southern Portugal Albarinho expression ."
12575,7150649,"Yellow-green color delighting the eyes as the autumnal sun still shines. Juice and zest of lime and lemon, pineapple, white pear and peach. Very enjoyable, quite acidic and mineral. Crispy. Bittery.  I miss Portugal..."
12576,7150649,Best wine for fish and other things of the sea.. 
12577,7150649,"Very nice, more intense aroma’s. A very nice coloured, white wine. Perfect to compare with a nice whitefish."
12578,7150649,"3,8 for this intense Lisboa alvarinho."
12579,7150649,Yellow color that makes you think it might taste buttery but no it it is citrus and fresh. Enjoyed it thoroughly 
12580,7150649,Smoked black currant leafs and a hint of lichee.
12581,7150649,"Fresh a bit citrus, not super acidic but easy to drink. Good with greasy fish. "
12582,7150649,Aroma of peach and mouth full flavours..
12583,1970230,"First impression thin, but develops better. "
12584,1970230,"A nice fairly light red wine ,very soft and almost no tannins. Goes very well with a light  lunch chicken or fish or drink on its own . For this price I recommend it . "
12585,1970230,"Thin, but strong and long aftertaste."
12586,1970230,As for Alentejano wine it is too intensive and has a strong alcohol smell. Nevertheless pretty good with heavy food.
12587,1970230,Smooth with chicken
12588,1970230,Remembering Of Portugal 
12589,1970230,"A 5 € le magnum, une excellente surprise!"
12590,1970230,Taste vs. price is very good. Easy to drink and well balanced wine. 
12591,1970230,"Cheap as chips, nice enoughwine...."

12593,1970230,Fruité Vincent apero
12594,6345955,Aromas of forest fruits and black chocolate. In the mouth it has present and round tannins. Balanced and elegant end of mouth.
12595,6345955,"Oh the Dao reds. So tasty, so nicely balanced, so not particularly well known. So, yeah, that's a decent bottle of red, mild tannins, some dark fruit and just a hint of spice. Appropriately, I had it with grilled chicken kebabs because they're on the stronger side and it's supple enough not to be overpowering."
12596,6345955,"really pleasant, smooth, medium bodied, blackberry on the nose.... lovely with cheese... "
12597,6345955,"Good Dao, so easy to drink and a good price. "
12598,6345955,"Dark, warm and sweet. Very easy to drink. Definite hint of strawberry "
12599,6345955,"Red fruit, long legs, rich bouquet with vegetable notes but a flat aftertaste :: jantar dona marta com os sollero"
12600,6345955,Cabeça de Velho is a reasonable Dão with a regular structure.   Blackberry on the nose.  Tannins not so strong.  
12601,6345955,Unbalanced tannins and acidity. Citric fruits and leather smell.
12602,6345955,Good value wine. Very fruity
12603,6345955,Nice red wine with hints of red fruit.
12604,6345955,Good value for money in Portugal
12605,6345955,Good midweeker. Would buy again. 
12606,6345955,"Blackberries on the nose, quite smooth with a hint of spice, dry with a nice long finish. Bargain!!!! "
12607,6345955,sharp and fruity..quite nice
12608,6345955,"It's a bit acidy, still ok though "
12609,4975104,"Wine with a very pale colour! Very fruity nose what was a bit surprising for a Douro Wine! Then, there it was, on the first taste a lot of acidity that disappeared after the wine caught i bit of breath :-) ! The minerality was there, the freshness, but still the fruity notes. Really enjoy it!"
12610,4975104,Very good value. Mildly and beautifullly flavoured 
12611,4975104,"Fruity, light and accessible "
12612,4975104,Great white wine! Complex with its personality!
12613,4975104,"Great wine! Very pleasant on the nose (peache, melon, some citrus notes), quite sophisticated taste palette: it balances sort of creamy minerality with pleasant acidity and fruity tones, at the end it leaves beautiful long aftertaste.  Needs to be served chilled (about +8C) not colder, to help open the flavour and aroma. The wine is produced by a small producer on a quantity of only 2000 bottles a year. So to find this wine on market isn't easy. "
12614,4975104,"Great quality, mineral white from Douro. "
12615,4975104,"(87/100) Great acidity, citric and very gastronomic. Made from 100% Gouveio, a grape variety very typical from Douro. "
12616,4975104,"First time tasting, individual nose, zesty, fresh and quite unique. Pairing with fish at Tuga in Singapore. "
12617,4975104,A strong Gouveio by Joana from the BaixoCorgo(Vila de Poiares) full of white bone fruits and citrus fruits with a nice mineral finish
12618,4975104,"Very special on the nose with guava, grass and peach/melon. Wine needs some temperature and time (15-20min) to open up. Drinking it too cold and/or early emphasises acidity. Dominant flavour is guava, grass and citrus - maybe a hint of peach. Offers also some minerals."
12619,4975104,"Zesty and fresh with green apple, lemon and some minor peach. Certainly far from dry like some reviews are saying but it’s delicate and it has a medium finish. Surprisingly another reviewer is right - this can not be too cold as i found out. I was first a little disappointed when delivered cold - it’s needs to be chilled only. It’s a lovely wine and goes well with light tapas."
12620,4975104,"Very aromatic White made from the Gouveio grape from the Douro region. Clean nose with aromas of grass (quite SauvBlanc like), peach, green melon. Dry and medium bodied palate with a rather high acidity and flavours of white peach, nectarine, lemon zest, iron. Medium length finish. 12,5% - €35 @ Kais restaurante, Lisbon"
12621,4975104,Very nice wine with depth and strong notes of green apple as well as dried fruits and citrus.

12625,6021428,"Found it on offer an wanted to try Dao.   Nice to smell, first sip enters hard but with  red fruit palate.  Better to drink with meat than alone "
12626,6021428,very good wine 
12627,6021428,An honest Dão for quarentena. Goes down well . 
12628,6021428,"Flat, tart, cherry, full-bodied, spicy finish, weak flavor "

12630,6021428,"Somewhat different than the average, blend if roriz, touriga and jean verietals. Spicy finish. 9/30/19"
12631,6021428,"It must be the atmosphere in Lisbon... every wine you try is fantastic! Full bodied Dāo with plenty of spices and ripe berries. Needs to breathe, though. Long and silky aftertaste, with lots and f smoked spices. Extremely easy to drink and pair. "
12632,6021428,"Clear, deep ruby colour. Medium pluss intensity nose, aroma of dark red berries, plastelina, and strawberry. Dry, high acid, medium pluss tannins. Fruitdriven, lightly bitter, redfruit. Refreshing!"
12633,6021428,"Intense, deep flavour, better nose , Nice blend of tradicional varietals"
12634,6021428,"[Restaurant Sommelier, Lisbon 2/4] We selected a variety of starters so a red was also necessary. I left it to the sommelier and we got this nice Dão.  Subtle, earthy nose with black cherry and cinnamon followed by a fruity palate with nice, tart, integrated, dry tannins, black fruit and licorice. 3.6"
12635,6021428,"A decent red table wine from Dão.  👃 Plum mainly (pronounced)  👅 Plum, blackberry. High alcohol. Medium+ acidity, and body. Medium flavor intensity, tannins and finish."

12640,2100836,Love wine where the touriga nacional really comes into its own right. 
12641,2100836,"Dark ruby red, plum and cherries, quite big body."
12642,2100836,"Fantastic red. Best of Portugal, in my modest opinion. I had this in Tallin. "
12643,2100836,"Plum and cherry, nice tannins "
12644,2100836,Very easy drinking and went down well with the lamb I ate.

Their vineyards are with the local varieties, such as Touriga Nacional, Alfrocheiro, Tinto Cão, and Encruzado. New French oak barrels shaped the nose with toasty and herbal notes. In the mouth, it is balanced with mineral texture which gives some deepness. Its full-body, medium acidity and fine-grained tannins lift the finish. It is a quite interesting wine"
12646,2100836,"Olive notes, wonderful wine"
12647,2100836,"Nice smooth oak with lavender, blackberries and  White peppers."
12648,2100836,Black currant bomb. At its peak now

12651,2100836,Espectacular! Grande Escolha (Great Choice)! Let it breathe one hour or more before drinking. It will reward your patience beautifully. 
12652,2100836,"My rating 3,9 . Cc"
12653,2100836,Still one of my Portuguese favourites. Fruity with berries and nice tannins.
12654,1262782,"Medium yellow color, white fruits, toast and vanilla on nose. Unctuous, balanced with long finish, very elegant.  Paired with appetizers, Saturday night.  Bad QPR!  Rate 4.2"
12655,1262782,"Zesty lime and tropical fruit. Robust, linear acidity. Might have guessed CA chardonnay if blind. Truly enjoyable on a sunny restaurant balcony (helps if it looks out over a marina) and bridges the gap from seafood to white meats."
12656,1262782,"Notes from a previous world. 100% Viosinho matured in Portuguese oak. Ripe and tangy feel with apricot, cinnamon spice and creamy mouthfeel. Whiff of pine needles. Refreshing and again some unusual flavours and textures in Portuguese grapes."

12658,1262782,"Great, full bodied white! 12,5o, but seems more."

Lightly toasty w. delicate vanillin leading to a long balanced finish."
12665,1262782,"Don't know much about Viosinho. But this is delicious: dry, characterful, 'mature' white which brought to mind a wine we tried some years ago -- 'La Nuit Blanche', a Roussanne varietal. "
12666,1262782,Delicious. Another great white from Douro valley. Burgundy style. Great RQP Highly recommended! 
12667,1262782,"I start to really like white wines from Douro. This is still super young, very floral and quite fatty. Great nose of vanilla oak, white peach, pear. Lighter on the palate than expected from the nose. Will but more from the region and keep. I start to think there are hidden gems in this terroir worth finding. "
12668,1262782,"This type of wine get's a lot of advantage, when is kept for some time in a barrique... Structure and long acidity... Nice but far from being special...."
12669,2328760,"Very good. Great value. Citric but lightly tropical, good weight but overall quite fresh and very enjoyable. To buy and drink in the next couple of years with great pleasure."
12670,2328760,"This is everything positive I rly surprised entails. At first it seems like abnormal whittle, but then it opens up. You get the almost maple taste, good aroma and solid aftertaste. You should go for it at this price range"

12684,2139376,"Absolutely stunning Port wine. Gentle and complex all at the same time, very rich flavors of dark fruit like blackberry and plum, and dried fruit like fig and raisin, chocolate and leather and some herbal flavors like rosemary. One of the best red Port wines we’ve ever had."
12685,2139376,Vallado is my favorite portmaker. Very good porto vintage.
12686,2139376,Not a great finish.  Could be more complex
12687,2139376,"Damsons, plum , mulberries,and spice. Yummy tannins at the end. A very good Vintage Port "
12688,2139376,"95/100 From the 2016 Port Vintage declaration tasting.  Very floral and expressive on the nose. Smells like red fruit, violets, and pepper. While the nose smells more like lighter red fruit, the palate is rich and chewy. Mouthfilling flavors with racing acidity and fine tannins. Good alcohol integration. "
12689,2139376,"Stellar.  Refined and lush on flavors; tangerine zest, nuts, dried fruits like figs and raisins. Very good pleasant acidity to keep the balance right. A balsamico vinegar texture. Not too sweet, very complex and a endless finish. Very good indeed.  Perswijn Select tasting"

We had laugh and fun, sipping this velvety burlat cherry syrup, supported by cocoa, spices and herbal. Fresh and massive. Ready for a long run. "
12692,2139376,"Black fruit, perfect balance, complex, drier than LBV. Dry figs and a hint of spice with a long aftertaste."
12693,2139376,"Another pearl from de 2011 vintage. We find dark plum, chocolate, vegetal notes, spices, and humus. Smooth, rich, with a   good acidity and a tannic structure, gives a powerful sensation in  the palate. We have a vintage for the future but also pleasure at the present. 18 v"
12694,2139376,"Excellent Vintage Port!  A rich and perfumed Port made from a field blend of old vines plus Touriga Nacional, aged 20m in stainless steel vats.

12721,1459055,"It starts with a slight fruit and ends with an unpleasantly astringent taste. It was a perplexing wine. None of my guests admitted to actually not liking it, but none protested when I took it from them and gave them a different wine. I did not like it. "

12743,1810737,very interestingly different
12744,3920595,"A Dao I like! I’m usually not a fan of toasty oak, but here it works. Cherry cough-syrupy fruit, with cinnamon, on both the nose & taste. Led by jaen (i.e. mencia, which makes sense & likely why I like it), along with alfochiero & others. Toasty oak on the nose & finish. Its best feature. The mid-palate is strong enough to stand up to the oak. A fruity finish on the edge of residual sugar (which helps explain all the body). Could go a few more years. I liked it & tried to rebuy. 4.0 woofs is correct."
12745,3920595,Leather and red fruit aroma. Taste-wise fresh and on the dryer side with notes of cherry and leather. 
12746,3920595,"Excellent wine from Dão. With red fruit, smoke and oak aromas, medium in tannins, dry but smooth in end. Well balanced! "

12753,3920595,Clipstone tasting notes - Very Sharp
12754,3920595,3.9 very unique on the nose compared to a unique taste profile. This would be a great steak pairing wine or something to quiz guests on what it is.
12755,3920595,"A  mild spicy and intense aroma. Light bodied, a strong presence, a bit bitter with a hint of oak at the end and a wonderful aftertaste."
12756,3920595,"After one sip of this one you’d want to take a second straight away. And then a third. It’s light, refreshing and beautifully balanced. Great value. Cherry, raspberry - and also chocolate and caramel on the palate. Just a bit of forest floor. "
12757,3920595,"Elegance that is rarely found so young in the DÃO. Very good and drinkable... Great wine, loved it!"
12758,3920595,Wine.com pick really smooth
12759,1221912,Bright mineral nose with a hint of underlying perfume. Slight cream on a body with light oak. Good acidity on the medium finish.
12760,1221912,"great wine, notes of tropical fruit on nose with pineapple showing in the front along with zest of lemon and great acidity - finishes with a nutty touch "
12761,1221912,"Citrus notes, inorganic minerals, and maybe pineapple? Also a tiny hidden hint of almond and toffee that balances the sharp acidity. Quenching, and certainly something for warmer days."
12762,1221912,"Biodynamic farming, low intervention winemaking blend of two autochthonous varieties partly aged in oak to add structure. White fruits and flowers, mineral notes, delicate vanilla and dry honey, med acidity, abv 11.5 Fresh yet with enough structure to accompany fat fish. "
12763,1221912,"80% Bical, 20% Arinto. 10% in oak 500 – 600l pipas. 2 months in bottle. 11.5%. tartaric acid: 4.72 g/l. Total sugar <2 g/l. No fining agent. Soil: сhalky clay midslopes, 15 km from the ocean. Bical is harvested in the beg. of Sep, the Arinto matures later for 2 – 3 weeks. Vinification happens seperately. wine matures on the lees without batonnage. wines stabileses naturally during the cold winter. Pearish nose (typical for the Bical grape) with some hints of iode and a certain spiciness (thyme and rosemary)"
12764,1221912,"Again excellent wine from Filipa Pato, great Portuguese winemaker. A blend of Bical and Arinto. The main aroma I feel is melon, also lime rasps, but others referred can be noticed like pears, minerals. Dry, mouthwatering, acid, a remarkable white wine. Very pleasant and refreshing."
12765,1221912,"Nice blend of Bical and Arinto from Bairrada.  Biodyn farming. Authentic winemaking with minimal intervention.  White flowers, green apple and citrus.  Clean and fresh.  Med bodied. Harmonious acidity.  Great white blend for small money 👍 "
12766,1221912,"Great white Portuguese blend  from Bairrada, Bical & Arinto, a medium yellow color  with greenish reflexes. Minerals, sea saltiness, smoke, texture from oak barrel fermentation and delicate creaminess. Wine with aromas white ripe fruits and the accents of citrus and grapefruit bitterness. Very elegant wine."
12767,1221912,"Amazing whine. Bical and Arinto make for a very acid vivid white, which shined accompanying a seafood risotto.  Loved the father's wines, love the daughters as well. Citric notes are dominant as expected for this grapes."
12768,1221912,"Bright nose of lemon honey green apple lime tropical fruit notes, pear . Full bodied, lowish acidity, nice minerality on the palate and a long long finish. Probably a fatter wine than I was expecting, I usually associate Filipa Pato with bracing acidity. This is delicious to drink on its own. "
12769,1221912,"Citrus, minerals  and stone fruit. Very enjoyable."
12770,1221912,Excellent.   Salt and fresh.  Persistent.

12773,1221912,nice little mineral taste white wine
12774,1443731,"This wine was a great surprise, sweet and sour like Semillon usually is but with an amazing balance between both"
12775,1443731,"Rich on the nose with first hints of dry wooden driven aromas a reflection of maybe a little too much wood used for aging. Preserving citric freshness on the palate, medium body, a little bit to alcoholic 13,5% is too much, and with medium persistence. A promising wine with some room for improvement although not a bad one and well made"
12776,1443731,"Gold oil colour. Scent of wood,smoke. Taste  sour, wood. Medium body some acidity. "
12777,1443731,Nice Yellow Fruit Taste!
12778,1443731,Extra with fish
12779,1443731,Really great wine with fish...light with fruity accents went beautifully with the meal
12780,1443731,Not the crisp taste i would expect from a chardonnay.
12781,1443731,"Some Older Whites #4 (Semillon / a 2013 drinking 2018): I had been assuming that Semillon was an alien rarity in Portugal, so it was interesting to see it described on the label as ""a traditional grape variety in the Douro Valley, locally known as Boal"". Anyway, I don't find it very expressive, at least not on the (mainly buttery) nose, but on the palate there's a lovely poise between shades of candied fruit, sweet peach, fine resiny grass, and a lingering citrus peel. (Real Companhia Velha; 13% abv)."
12782,1443731,"Very good,  clean and crisp."
12783,1443731,Excellent and lasting taste. Fruity and wood mixture. 
12784,1443731,Tio’s favorite white wine. 
12785,1443731,"medium body, balanced citrus notes, wood , nice finish"
12786,1443731,"A nice white from douro, not the typical one, but this one is not mineral but fruity. With a lemon clear clolour, it has a lot of tropical fruits like mango papaya and pineapple, in taste in is a a tropical palate as well, its not the strongest of tastes but its a good one"
12787,1443731,Some flowers. Then honey. Not so long. Just white wine.
12788,1443731,Robust nose with bold floral and woody scents.  Lighter citrus and smoke of the palate but the only floral aspects are the scents mentioned before.  A nice blend of soft acidity and sweetness to owe to a full and firm balance.  Quick finish of smoke and floral scents.  Not bad ....
12789,2200728,"Light honey start with a white grapefruit finish. Goes well with fish salads, seafood pizza, and fried oysters. "
12790,2200728,"Dry, not too fruity! Could have more grape flavor. "
12791,2200728,Dry with a fiz but with a sweet after taste.
12792,2200728,Fruity and dry
12793,2200728,"Quite interesting wine, but without intense grape flavor "
12794,2200728,"Checking out the wines of Adegamãe, starting with this unoaked Fernão Pires-Arinto blend.  Pale lemon. Pretty w. white blossom, peach, apple & fresh ripe citrus. Simple, but fruit-forward w. lightly floral notes. Very clean, fresh & bright. Youthful.  Dry. Bright & fruity w. lemon, lime, grapefruit, apple, white peach & nectarine. Lots of flavour here fo the price. Good freshness w. med alc, m+ acid & a m+ finish w. peach kernel & white blossom floral notes. Good value."
12795,2200728,"Grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, nice body and accidity, reminds me I should drink more Portuguese whites, 12.5%, excellent value even in Brazil , 3.6."
12796,2200728,"Citrus like a lemon and a grapefruit, and syrup on the nose. At first feel gas slightly on the tip of the tongue. The taste is like ripe orange with pleasant acidity. The overall impression doesn’t change after the temperature goes up. I think this is great daily wine and goes well with fish meunière, sautéed clams with butter."
12797,2200728,"3.6🌟 Just makes rebuy for me based on quaffability factor and fun, new 🇵🇹 grapes👍🏻  🍇 Fernao Pires and Arinto.   Explosive aromatics with citrus 🍊 and tropical aromas. Also, very floral and reminds me of a Torrontes.  Piercing acidity. Very fresh and fruit forward on the palate. Unfortunately, finish is a tad short but has a nice saline twang👍🏻  My pregame warmup for 🅱️ Thursday!

12820,2294535,Green peppers from Cabernet are present and nicely harmonized.
12821,2294535,"Opens up well, however ultimately this lacks notes of particular interest justifying the high price tag, especially compared to its sister white wine"
12822,2294535,"Nice blend of 70% Touriga Nacional and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, and if the price of Vivino is correct, a good bang for the buck! Medium intense aromas of blackberry, plum, blackcurrant, vanilla. Full bodied palate with firm but supple tannins, medium acidity, and flavours of black fruit, graphite, caramel, salty touch, bit of green paprika. A tiny bit too greenish to be really excellent, but still great! Long finish. 14,5% - €? @ Megavino (B) "

Great BBQ supporter, pleasant sole. Excellent QPR! 3,7-3,8."
12828,4898958,"Near perfect Portuguese partner for a robalo grelhado, grilled seabass. Distinct gooseberries, grapefruit and pear present themselves. Make sure to tilt this bottle out of the fridge at least 15 minutes before drinking. The sooner the more fruits for you 👍"

12837,4898958,"Light colour and grassy to the nose, this Portuguese white is going to be drank with a lemony cod fish. The taste is dominated by Granny Smith apples, lemon and limes with a herbal and anis finish. Amazing price for value, interesting wine."
12838,4898958,"Portuguese whites strike again!  Lots of tropical fruits on the nose with this one. Banana, mango, pineapple and pear. Palate is way different with sour green apple, like those candies I used to eat as a child, hints of like as well with nice minerality. Medium finish. Very good."
12839,4898958,"Very reminiscent in style to a Southern French white - think Marsanne, Roussanne, Grenache Blanc. Earthy minerality meets pear with well balanced acidity and a good whack of alcohol. Equally at home with or without food"

12846,1306596,"From the almost best year ever in Portugal (2011) with tannins that makes the best Brunello in Montalcino being seriously challenged. (( fine soft and yet bone hard structure)) In some aspects almost drawing toward a port wine with chocolate notes, mature leather and dark fruit. Drink now or without any loss, probably only better in the next 10 years. "
12847,1306596,"Dark chocolate swirls give way to lush rich fruit. Working hard to get by the earthy round tannins to red pimento. On the table for a few hours before gulping down. Nice even sediment, no caking bits."

12856,1179680,"An excellent Vintage Port from one of the principal names in the Port trade, for sipping after dinner as the first snowstorm of the season swirls outside. Ruby red, raisins and chocolate with a fair amount of crust, and a huge bargain at just $20."

12862,1179680,"Great port and great value. Rich aroma of raisins, prunes,  dark berries and chocolate. Feels very youthful, and alcohol is still not very integrated. Still great to drink now and has huge potential."
12863,1179680,"Founded in 1790. Now run by George Sandeman, the 7th generation of the Port family. 🍇Tinta Roriz, Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca. From Sandeman's ""A"" rated Quinta do Vau. Bottled in 2002. Deep garnet colour. Aromas of raisins, dried fruits, cinnamon, plums, cherries 🍒 and oak. On the palate raisins, dried fruits, cherries, spices, cinnamon and blackberries. A sweet, hot'n spicy and balanced Port. A med+ body with soft med tannins. A med acidity and a long spicy 🏁. With saffron buns and ☕. 4.2 🌟. 😋"

12869,1179680,Very nice now. Smooth tannins and juicy fruit. 90p
12870,76409,WS top 100 2015.   Number 84  Great price quality index.   Darker fruits.  Spiced up with an aromatic floral nose.  Tannins smoothen after short aeration.  Nice warm mouthfeel but alcohol less than 14 percent.   Licorice moment at the finish. The more I drink touriga nacional.  The more I crave more.
12871,76409,"Good wine at a good price. A mouth full , blackberries and oak final..... Average acidity , very pleasant indeed. Invites a good meal or just sitting by the fireplace !!!!"

Dark cherries, raspberries, blueberries, dark chocolate, minerals, oak, and spices on the palate.  Finishes with lingering fruit and spice, and velvety tannins.  Enjoyed with Veal Margarita at a favorite Italian Restaurant."
12873,76409,"4.2🌟. Just a fantastic wine for the price! My second review and it's even better this time. Aromas of plum, dark cherries and a wonderful floral note.  Dark fruit and spice on the palate. Tannins are nicely integrated.  Chocolate and licorice show up on the finish. At under $20, this easily drinks like a wine twice that price. Worth the hype👏👏.  Try this, you won't be disappointed. Cheers everyone."
12874,76409,"On nose, blueberries and a hint of earth. On palate, aggressive start of spice and leather and a bit of berry. A little bitterness; dry; fairly tannic. Long finish of leather, spice, and a bit of blueberries. This is a big bodied wine.  Plums and spice come in as a second note. I prefer a little bit more elegance. Having it with Brie and crackers is great though. "
12875,76409,"A classic Douro blend rated  #84 at Top 100 WS in 2015. After 4y in cellar this entry wine remains powerful, with aromas of blackfruits, flowers, earth and spices. Full bodied, round tannins and medium finish. Good evolution in bottle. Definitively, a consistent brand in Douro valley and a good value."
12876,76409,"I love Joao Ramos Duorum reds, always workers. Wood right on the spot, with air this changed so much. Notes of a punch jam flavor though balanced in wood and elegant thin tannins. Better than some previous ones from this house. "
12877,76409,"Repeating this wine today while we are cooking our Thanksgiving diner, turkey is in the oven, everything else is moving along. Wonderful Douro, top #84 best wine of 2013 at the Wine Enthusiasts list. Aromas of ripe dark fruits and spices. Full bodied, ripe tannins, balanced acidity, with a very smooth long aftertaste.  You all have a very happy and blessed Thanksgiving!!🍷🍷🦃🦃"
12878,76409,"Deep deep purple color, remarkably beautiful. Hints of spice and jam on the nose. Overall pretty harsh smell. On first taste, thin, stick/woody, and spicy. Tastes a little sour. We let it open for awhile too and it's surprising that it didn't body up more.  I'm so confused on we're this stands for me... Very unique and something we talked about over dinner but not what I was expecting. 3 stars for an average tasting wine for my palate but gains an extra star for uniqueness. Cheers!"
12879,76409,"Great bold wine, tannic and dry. Lots of dark fruit, chocolate, oak, leather and  earth on the nose. These characteristics continue to the taste, adding vanilla and slight tart cherry. It didn’t pair very well with our meal which ended up being quite spicy, but I really enjoyed before we ate, sipping with olives. "
12880,76409,"Wonderful Douro. Soft, smooth, rich fruit flavor but not syrupy. A touch of earthiness. Just great. "

12887,1928290,"Very interesting white port. It had golden hue. Fig and floral nose. It reads like a young tawny, with caramel, raisin, and hazelnut, but still preserving some red fruit."
12888,1928290,"Sherry nose with notes of flowers, nuts and spices.  Biter-sweet on the palate with notes of dried fruit, wood, spices, apricot and raisins. Not bad! 90"
12889,1928290,I was ripped off.  I was fool
12890,5443364,Extremelly Light coloured. A bit Closed on the nose but with evident notes of red fruits. Very elegant and pleasant to drink. Fruity but without overpowering sweetness. One of the best Portuguese roses. 
12891,5443364,"This would have been the summer rose 2020 for us - wasn’t it for the 13,5 %😬 With the two very robust grapes as a base and the Duros unmistakable backbone, the white peaches & raspberries tinted with a floral hint makes it yummy!  Did I mention that it comes in a funky bottle and that the ash rose color is just perfect! Looking forward to try the Reserva!"
12892,5443364,"Floral and Red Fruit. Great nose, long in the mouth. A very serious Rose... Not your usual pool wine. "
12893,5443364,Super pale like the wines from Provence

12899,5443364,A very nice Rosé. Had this at Graham’s port cave in Vila Nova de Gaia
12900,5443364,"I am surprised! Not a fan of rosés but since it’s summer I have been tasting some, this one stands out! The aroma is intense but not in a way which burns your nostrils, although it is full. The flavor is a bit mysterious or maybe I lack in the right adjectives. It is smooth, well bodied it almost feels like a sheet of silk with a touch of brandy. Absolutely fantastic 👏🏾👏🏾"
12901,5443364,"Nose: med intensity  Strawberry, cranberry, toast, white pepper Palate: dry, high acidity, med- body, med alcohol, med+ intensity, med finish  Good quality  Drink now. Not suitable for further ageing "
12902,5443364,"Pale salmon in color. Nose of citrus, orange peel, and slight red fruit. Medium acidity, refreshing body with a touch more weight on it.

12906,1522830,"4,2 - amazing QPR and example of the Baga grape. Extreme softness of fruit however with lots of depth and complexity. Amazing wine"
12907,1522830,"A perfect match with lamb racks! Very balanced by the ripe blackberry fruits, weight and richness. Good density and mature fruit. oak plum."
12908,1522830,"Plums, dark cherries, tobacco and vanilla. Round velvety body. Strawberries and wood in a fresh finish. Needs some time to open up. Initially may look a bit obscured by the oaky notes. "
12909,1522830,"Ruby red colour with many fast legs.  Bold bouquet fruity with black fruit, plum and vanilla.  Bold, elegant, complex and dry on the palate. Red fruit, plum, oak   Grape Bairrada 13% alcohol Portuguese bold wine good with red meat, lamb and matured cheese.  From Adega de Cantanhede, 2 thirds up to Porto from Lissabon."
12910,1522830,"3,8⭐Nice Bairrada red showing off the 🍇Baga. 👀Ruby with garnet rims. Quick tears. 👃Pleasant and different (for those not familiar with Baga) with cedar, pine, oak and cherry. 👅Balanced and bold with punchy tannins. Dry and nice acidity. 🗒️Pretty good to pair with strong cheeses. Think it will age well. One to retry in a few years for sure."

12929,2183165,"What a great find! Dark purple with deep blackcurrant, tar and a hint of smoked meat on the nose. But then you try it and it’s lighter than it expected, full of flavour and silky. Paired with beef wellington at Kinship HK. "
12930,2183165,"Well today it's the 46th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, so a Portuguese wine was in order. This took a while for any smell to become apparent. Black cherry, blackcurrant, big hefty body. Tar licorice. Now to finish it off with some cheese. "

Palate is quite tannic and acidic ( a tad off balance), medium + alcohol, medium acidity. Long finish, not as pleasant as 6033 or reserva, but interesting. Pepper,  plum and some dark chocolate.  Persistent and food demanding wine. "

12947,5388219,"dark, rich and complex, nice overall "
12948,5388219,"Medium to full bodied, moderately dry. Black currants, cherries. Earthy, full on the nose and mouth. Easy drinking. Had in Portugal with seasoned pork. Delicious!"
12949,1508901,"Blackberry, chocolate, leather and pepper. Good balance and tanines but lacks a stronger ending "
12950,1508901,"Rather complex wine with a hint of leather and smoke, bargain for its price."
12951,1508901,"A world-class Portuguese red we clearly have here. Deep, well balanced between rich body and dense smooth texture and solid acidity, with well-integrated oak, yet packed-full of it. The richness and ripeness of the fruit shines through with abundance and, paradoxically, opulent finesse. Score it a 93/100 points on Social Vignerons. Beyond the concentration and elegance, the layered complexity is an outstanding feature of this 2014 Heredade de São Miguel Reserva. Enjoy :-)"
12952,1508901,"This wine is a deep red color with an elegant, round profile. It shows blackberry and cherry with notes of vanilla, spices and mineral accents. Details of floral, tea and licorice are framed by well structured tannins, which should allow it to age well. "
12953,1508901,"Portuguese wine is hard to find but boy is it worth it! Fruit forward but dry with blackberries, black cherries and cassis. Strikes a perfect balance with oak, some tobacco and soft tannins. What an amazing wine, too bad it’s sold out now. 94 "
12954,1508901,The best wine the producer had at this year's Alentejo wine show in Beja. Black and blue fruit. Well-balanced and persistent.
12955,1508901,"3.9 Very fresh red fruit, cherry and nice and still-present tennins (that may last a few years too). 2006 vintage tried early 2021"
12956,1508901,"Deep purple in the glass with long and thick legs. Open and appealing nose of chocolate, oak, and dark fruit. Nicely balanced. "
12957,1508901,"90+/100 Blend of Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez, Touriga Nacional, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Notes of black fruit, black prune, pepper, and herbs along with a lot of oak. This is big and structured, there’s a lot of stuffing here. It needs time for the oak to settle and the baby fat to fall off but it should be fine in the cellar. Not to drink now, but to lay down for another five years."
12958,1508901,Purple in color. Medium to strong dry. Very well structured and med to strong tannins. Super balanced. Fully of wholesome berries. Nice finish and a great price!
12959,1508901,"WHAT a discovery. The best chocolate, plums, black fruits, but also mushrooms, granite, a hint of cedar. Tannins bold yet smooth: like 10 years and not just the 4 years of our vintage. Phenomenal. Not an overpowering nose, but subtle… of mint and licorice. Excellent finish. A steal for the price. HIGHLY recommended."

12962,1508901,"Big fan of Portuguese wines. And this one did not disappoint us. Structure of new world with beauty and elegance of old world. Cherry, strawberries, cinnamon and pepper together in this blend with aragonez, alicante bouschet and cabernet sauvignon. 18 months in french oak barrels, this Reserve is an awesome with good price. Alentejo is great!"
12963,1508901,"Deep ruby. Intensive nose of raisins, black cherry and plum overlayed with oak aromas like cloves, toast and coffee. Very good structure on the palate with powerfull tannins, high alcohol and full body. Nice and long finish."

12966,1269166,"Lovely dry subtle white, with still a hint of sweetness like honey? "
12967,1269166,Of a dark granate color with medium tannins and a smooth finish. Hints of oak wood as well as certain sweetness in mouth.  Highly recommended.
12968,1269166,"Beautifully smooth Douro red that opens with a fruity nose with a touch of oak. Balanced mouth with medium tannins, plum and a lovely vanilla that gets more prominent as it opens. Slightly mineral finish. Overall, really enjoyed this one!"

12970,1269166,Well valued. Tasted at Cantinho Do Avillez. Dry and oaky. A bit high in tannins. Tasted like blackcurrant.

12974,1269166,"Great combination of minerality and fruitiness, with walnut dearth and thickness in taste."
12975,1269166,A bit of oak and a pleasant touch of bitterness.   Overall lovely food wine
12976,1269166,Very good table white wine (13.5%). Crisps & elegant with floral bouquet. Super reasonable restaurant price of €31
12977,1269166,Crisp and refreshing 
12978,1269166,Good high acidity. Slight hint of plum! Very enjoyable 
12979,2341323,"Earthy tannins blending in well,  balsamic black raisin dark fruit earthy 5-spice powder brown bread"
12980,2341323,"Nice, smooth with complex and subtle aromas. "
12981,2341323,"91/100 Blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional aged in French oak. There is beautiful development here with notes of leather, tobacco, dried raspberry, dried cherry, and pepper. The palate still has substantial tannins and an earthy finish. There’s plenty of plush, developed fruit with high acidity. It acts almost Pinot Noir-esque. If you want the taste of aged wine that doesn’t break the bank, this is worth checking out."
12982,2341323,"Nice oak, not so strong, light tannins.  Ripe cherry, Let wine breath... Still a bit of chemical smell, it seems 2007 was a bit too old, if not for that it would be 5 stars"
12983,2341323,"Blackberry, vanilla, leather, juniper, smooth tannins, nice wine with lots of character. "
12984,2341323,"Cheira bem cheira a Lisboa! Que rico vinho regional de Lx. Generoso, rico e longo no paladar. Great value for money 😊"

12987,2341323,"Intense ruby color with a pleasant aromatic complexity that boasts ripe blackberries, cherries and some bergamot notes mixed with some toast of barrel wood in which it has aged. On the palate it reveals deepness with well polished tannins and a harmonious and persistent aftertaste!"
12988,2341323,"89 points 4⭐️s Portuguese wines are not exactly my fortes, but this was recommended so I gave it a go and I'm glad I did. A rustic nose, with notes of balsamic, blackberries, cherries, prunes and earth.  Steely/rusty tannins wrap the core of dark fruit and the med length and body make an overall enjoyable experience.  More Portuguese research required "
12989,2341323,"Good and well structured wine. Dry , intense , medium tannins . Very smooth and tasty ."
12990,2341323,Dark red color. Prunes on the nose and palate. Hints of oak and caramel on the mouth. Slightly citric/acid ending but still pleasant.

12994,2327107,Porto 3 A very decent 2018 DOURO reserva  with light body but muscled tanins and hidden acidity. Medium long aftertaste. Evolving aroma and taste. First attack of red berries with evolution in bitter cherry and leather in the taste. Some stringency as if fermented with the peduncles. Overall strong aromas of grape and muscled body of tanins and natural grape flavours. Some vanilla from the barrel. Should wait for +1 h to see the evolution. 
12995,2327107,"Portugal degustation #17. Solid wine. Very reminiscent of the northern Italian reds I usually have, perhaps a slightly lighter body. Rich in cherry and plum up front with some liquorice, vanilla, and oak underneath. Smooth tannins. "
12996,2327107,Well balanced fruitiness and a smooth easily drinkable red.

13040,1245984,"Dry, very fragrant "
13041,1245984,"I have mixed feelings on Dão wines, but this Dãl Touriga Nacional came in well. Eyes is rubi, dark, fluid but high bodied though. Scents of intense ripe black fruit, not so cherry light Dão. Mouth is a fruit very dry force (needs some 30 mins of air), leather and some oak finish. Light for a Touriga, balanced for a Dão. Changed my conception..."

13060,8609518,"A sublime example of excellent wine-making. Dry, with deep dark cherry, earthiness, some tobacco, some leather, a trace of spice, and a smooth yet quiet layer of oak. A dead-bang winner. With a few years of aging who knows where this would end up. Bravo!"

 Fantastic wine for the price."
13063,8609518,"Textbook Touriga Nacional giving fresh black and some blue fruit. Just a hint of prunes, black chocolate and lifted violet and grilled spices. Very attractive and classy perfumes. Medium to full body with high tannin and acidity. Sinewy but not unpolished with a warming, medium finish. Needs food. Better from 2023. Rating: 91/100 or 17/20 2023-2030"
13064,8609518,A very good monocaste. Wood and strawberry. Some of Dão flavours - the right amount of acidity.

13074,2867649,Reminiscent of a typical Ribera del Duero tempranillo. Fruit forward with a creamy smoothness on the finish. Not super complex but definitely super drinkable 
13075,2867649,"Blend of touriga Nacional, tinta roriz and alfrocheiro. Garnet ruby colour, blackcurrant and cherry. Pepper, vanilla and farmyard. Made using a field blend. 14% alcohol, the 2017 vintage had good acidity, integrated tannins, rich fruits with a full body, blackberry persistent finish "
13076,2867649,"Had this little red for our lunch, fish and rise. The wine has notes of oak vanilla black fruit "
13077,2867649,"Smooth, warm, medium heavy mouth feel."
13078,2867649,"Rich, fruity, well balanced and full bodied. Clesrly one to return too. Try it if you find it!"
13079,2867649,"I’m going to have to look for more Dão wines because I’m falling in love!  Sweet plum, vanilla, blackberry and stone on the nose. More black fruits, black cherry, sweet vanilla coating the sides of your mouth, very expressive and aromatic wine, and a touch of oak on the palate. Light+ tannins, medium+ acidity and medium body. Medium+ finish. Very good."
13080,2867649,Had this Dao red at one of good seafood joint at Matosinhos.  Too oaky and need some decanting before. Not ideal pairing for me because it has too much torque with some delicious seafood. 
13081,2867649,"Quite subtle fruit, with high tannic quite acidic and full bodied - nice but a bit muted overall if the flavours coming through compared to tannin and acidity "
13082,2867649,"High on acid and low on fruit. Needs a bit of decanting and becomes a sooth character. Pistachio, almonds, mandarin."
13083,2867649,"Spicy plums, black currant, pepper and oak. Spicy bold palate."

13088,2533375,Great to try this one again as it was my father's favorite after the last wine fair in Stockholm. Ferocious tannins with a great flow of fruits and herbs beneath whispers of golden days to come. Should be opened in about 4-5 years.

13090,2533375,Soft. Intensive aroma. Dark red fruits. Excellent balance.

13092,1293594,Impeccable and focused. 100 💯 years old vines. Decant. Needs air and time. Unfiltered. Bottled in 2015. One of the top five Portuguese wines
13093,1293594,"Bottled in August 2015 is still too young to open. Even if it is open now reveals all the potential. Yet a great wine , but should stay in the bottle to rest some more years.  "
13094,1293594,"Outstanding red from Douro and one of my Portuguese favorites! A lush single vineyard field blend with century old vines and 30 varieties, aged 20m in new French (85%) and American (15%) oak barrels.

Deep purple color, floral, ripe dark berries aromas/flavors, with notes of spices, mint, chocolate and beautifully integrated oak. Full body, with silky tannins and a delicious endless finish. Exquisite, still growing!"

13096,1293594,During my chef table the guests brought this wine and we had it together.....I was a bit worried as he said this is one of the best in Portugal..yea right....  And it was a superb wine. Deep purple with violet hints...beautiful nose of caramel and berries and vanilla  Fruityness on the palate...still a bit young with strong tannins but powerful and great. Long lasting finish...truly a stunning wine

13108,16965,"90/100 Aged for 18 months in oak, this is a dark, inky wine. Notes of black raspberry, black plum, and dried purple flowers. You notice the wood but it blends in with the fruit. This is a wine with super high acidity, it feels like a Refosco. Firm tannins but they are washed away by the acidity. Cool wine."
13109,16965,"Mint notes, rich, velvety texture, and plenty of fresh fruit notes - nice balsamic notes and dark fruits - nice wine 😊🍷"
13110,16965,An absolute dream.very good memori3s from duero valley and Madera

13114,16965,"Uncommon single varietal wine.  Deep purple color,  Nose of dark berries, currant, pepper, very ripe berries, and even banana (which was weird/interesting and not unpleasant).  Dry, fine but present tannins, high acid.  I would love to try this wine again in 5-6 years to see what its like when the acidity is balanced out in the wine "
13115,16965,"Deep dark ink ruby red color, interesting nose with hints of black forest fruits, blackcurrant, riped plums and some spice. Medium to full body, nice structured tannins, well balanced acidity and good alcohol integration. Pleasent on the palate with notes of blackcurrant, oak, vanilla, riped plums and spice. The finish is medium to long preserving the palate notes adding a hint of dark chocolate at the end. Excellent ageing potential and QPR. Really nice wine to be shared with friends."
13116,16965,"Wine tasting course. Module 2: Tasting of unknown grapes.  👁 Purple with ruby tones. Medium-high robe. 👃Red Fruits, spices, vanilla. 👅 Frutal. Cherry, strawberry, blackcurrant. Very dry, balanced acidity, firm tannins. Medium finish."
13117,16965,Deep dark red colour.  Spicy and bold on the nose. High in tannins with smooth finish. Sweet cherry undertones
13118,16965,"oak, dark fruit, cherry, very nice balanced mainly touriga nacional (with four other grapes) "
13119,16965,"Interesting experience with this single varietal. Deep dark inky color. General notes of dark fruit and spice, but this is not a fruit forward Wine . The Sousao variety is used as one of the typical blends in the Douro Valley. You can see the potential to add color and perhaps an acidic note to bring balance. Tannins are mild. "
13120,16965,"Really enjoyed this. At a steak restaurant and would have normally chosen an Argentinian Malbec. This was a Portuguese Douro. Had a lovely mouthfeel, not too acidic. Powerful but good balance with enough fruit. "
13121,16965,Awesome dry red from Portugal. 
13122,1216244,"PORT WINE ORIGINS (JAESON WINE 6/6)  2011 continues to sing! Another Symington label, and the first Duoro vineyard to produce & sell wines under its own name. Produced in traditional stone Lagares, this has depth I can fall into and not climb out. What a pleasure to share w/ Jaeson & Bruce.  A bottomless buffet of fig, boisenberry, black tea, tar, clove, cigar smoke & cinnamon. This will age beautifully! (Well, not THIS bottle! Lol) The structure & quality of this one was astounding!"
13123,1216244,"Very nice, soft, flower aroma. Impressive, fruity, very ""Porto"" taste with beautiful attack in few moments. Excellent"
13124,1216244,"Dark ruby red color, black currant "
13125,1216244,"Somewhat disappointed with this one - all a bit smooth - not much edge - a nice drink, yes, no argument, but not the wow factor of other 2011s I've had. Sipped from D+0, polished off at D+24."
13126,1216244,"Dark purple, fruitier for a port, probably a good port but also just not for me. Don’t think I like ports much. 3/5, had at Columbia wine class. "
13127,1216244,"Tasted at Waterfront Wines in Kelowna. Excellent vintage port showing very well at 10 years old. Strong notes of caramel, toffee, prune, and chocolate. One of my favourite ports I’ve tried."
13128,1216244,Joel LOVES this one. My after dinner drink connoisseur!!!!
13129,1216244,"Very brilliant, full body with heavy sweet forest berries "
13130,1216244,Abrupt finish. Josh got it as a nice gift and we opened it with Michelle’s cheese. 
13131,1216244,Full bodied. Creamy but a little on the boring side 
13132,1216244,Needs a few more years. Great for after dinner or sipping while in the jacuzzi.
13133,1216244,A very nice gift from my sister-in-law which we enjoyed with our Christmas cake on Christmas Day.  Not a brand I know.  Still young but drinking well.  Worth holding for a few more years yet.  Perhaps a shade off the Dow’s 1985 which we were also drinking over Christmas.
13134,1216244,"2014 Quinta de Roriz vintage port. Loved this. Not over bearing, not overly complex but great elegance, line, length and breed. Held its 20% all well and was just extremely enjoyable "
13135,1216244,"Still quite youthful. Licorice and molasses with raspberry.  Little edgy on the aftertaste. Good but needs another 5-10 years. After a few days, licorice, blackberries and floral aromas.  Raspberry and plums on the palate. 93 pts"
13136,1216244,"From one of the non declared vintages that should probably had been generally declared this is one of my favorites. Full of deliciously black currant fruit, plums, raspberries, and a fantastic minty presence on the nose which expresses a great balance "
13137,1105367,"Great Portugese white. Full fruity taste with oak! Real joyfull white wine. Oranges, yellow apples and a little lemon. Long lasting after taste"
13138,1105367,"Esporao Private Seletion is born in 2001 in the caves of historic Herdade do Esporao... since 12 hundreds.  From 20 year old Semillon vines emerges this spectacular white unic in grapes as well as in fermentation in 550 lts  french new oak barrels.  Terrificly fresh, full bodied this citric sweet and complex white faces any other white of Portugal head up!  Considering price, this is the best white value in lands of Cabral!! Monster white !!!!"
13139,1105367,"Dried pineapple, matured citrus aroma, medium to high acidity, relatively dry, lemon, mild pear taste, medium bodied, medium finish"
13140,1105367,"Golden colour, mineral nose. Tropical fruits, strawberry and thyme, even though acidity is just right. Pretty potent finish, with an accentuated oakyness to it."
13141,1105367,"Tasting wines from Alentejo, September 10. My favorite white was this. Straw color, tropical aroma, oily, buttery and complex - 6 months in French oak barrels."
13142,1105367,"Esporão in Pure essence! Semillon softened in oak barrels. Fruits: Peach, apple and pineapple. Great balance with perfect acidity. A remarkable and prolonged flavor. The year 2013 is Fantastic !!!!!!"
13143,1105367,"(4.1*) Wine and Japanese Food with Procopio, Antonio, Luis Fabiano Marin, Haroldo Rodrigues, Jorge Rosa, Jose Eduardo and Tavinho.  Grapes 100% Semillón, well balanced with aromas and flavors of vanilla and white fruits. Great finish. "

13145,1105367,Honey minerals and some oak
13146,1105367,"Golden colour  Nose: Very ripe and oaky hints on the nose. A lot of secondary notes, oak, butter, cream, yeast, wet basement, wet stone and honey. Small hints of primary notes of peach, apple and some apricot.   Palate: Medium-plus acidity. Some fruit of citrus and apricot. Hints of spice with cinnamon and pepper. Some caramel and the buttery feeling.  This is peaking now - I’m not sure it’s good in 2-5 years?"
13147,1105367,Esse private selection é super gostoso!
13148,1105367,Light oak tropical fruit mango balanced lightly acidic
13149,1105367,Very interesting white. Mainly Tropical fruits
13150,1105367,"Has been on a barrel before bottling. More tannins. Main Grape: Semillon. Would be good with Cod, chicken and more tasteful dishes.  Some similarities with Mersault.
 Needs and gets better with storage."
13151,1105367,Best white wine from Alentejo. Still a bit too young; needs a couple of years in cellar.
13152,2026462,Nice. Very deep aroma. Complex mainly round body.
13153,2026462,"Robust red-wine, soft fruity flavor very creamy, textured and tasteful acidity. I was in a great mood when I tasted it, so it could be some how overrated, but I really loved it!!!"
13154,2026462,"Very deep, with a gamey, rich nose. Cassis fruit and an earthy forest floor finish..!"
13155,3780467,"Repeating my last rating for this very nice Portuguese white. Super peachy nose and a creamy palate this time with an open bottle (instead of Coravin), beautiful evolution on the glass. "
13156,3780467,"Blackberry, forest fruit. A bit of gravel minerality. Serve chilled and with food. Consume while young. 84/3.4"
13157,3780467,Berries and a slight woody   flavour
13158,3780467,Great. Dry and balanced.
13159,3780467,Notes of cherry and blackberry. Young wine. Ok for the price
13160,3780467,"A good and fruity wine blends from different fields in Douro. Taste of ripe cherries, plums and some licorice. Fresh tasty palate."
13161,3780467,With Max on my first night in Lisbon 
13162,3780467,Lovely and fresh! Perfect for a summer day with fish! 
13163,3780467,Amazing taste that most of douro wines have
13164,3780467,"A nice Douro red that we enjoyed with a vegetarian smorgasbord in Porto.  Rich dark berry flavors and a hint of a tobacco; earthy & somewhat bituminous.  The strong character of this wine was a tasty & satisfying counterpoint to the spicy, light fare."
13165,3780467,Great value for money!!!
13166,3780467,"Bottle cap. Portuguese compressed cork, wine branded, short in size, violet minced top. Very dark color, medium bodied, very slow legs - even though only 13.5% volume, wide trim, red-brown rim. Decent nose, dominant metallic notes - hard to read out of it, some ripe fruit, warm, earthy, some alcohol breath. Decent palate, also some metallic notes, some dried fruit - especially for raisins and dried figs, some red fruit, soft but very dry tannins, wet grass and stone, some salinity on the finishing."
13167,3780467,"This is not a 4 but rather a 3.8, because if I rate 3.5 I probably won't buy or again and I'd much like to try this again. It's full bodied, nice aftertaste, a little spicy but not too much, it's nice  - it's just lacking something. And with my hint of a cold I can't put my finger on what. "

13170,76371,"This is sublime for such a young port. Sweet blackcurrant, lovely spices, sweet liquorice.. fresh apricot somehow. Exceptional potential."
13171,76371,96/100 Like a baby. So rich and concentrated with a ton of baby fat. The red fruit and tobacco notes are here with an orange peel finish. This is a little austere now but should age beautifully like most Vintage Ports. 
13172,76371,"Scent: Raisins, mint and sticky toffee pudding. A bit fiery or alcoholic on the nose. Medium intensity. However I would like a bit more character, it feels somewhat anonymous.  Looks: Dense/dark red/purple, almost black.  Mouthfeel: Sweet. ABV is 20%. Full bodied. Alcohol could be better integrated. Some licorice on the palate. Pairs well with stinky cheese.  Grape varieties: 50% Touriga National and 50% Touriga Franca. Hand harvested grapes. Maturation for 2 years in oak barrels."

13184,76371,Bought a few vintages ports @Winefields auctioneers. This 1999 has soft texture and a nice concentration - will be intresting how the profile develops over the next few days. 
13185,81371,A great ruby Port. This 2008 LBV is one of a kind. High concentration and an explosion of caramel and chocolate..A must drink to all Port lovers
13186,81371,"Dark dense ruby color, red forest berries, chocolate, dried leaves, forest aromas. Perfect ballanced whith long dry aftertaste, very structure and harmonious. Like it!"
13187,81371,Deep blackberry and blueberry fruit. Concentrated some mint and liquorice. Very special year. I met my fiancé in 2008;) great complexity and opulence. Fresh palate.
13188,81371,"Has a beautiful ruby color and an intense aroma of ripe red fruits. Rich, well-balanced flavors on the palate with excellent spicy tannins and a long peppery finish."
13189,81371,"Rehab works! I started liking ports! I am a sailor afterall!!  One of my V friends advised me to smoke the next Montecristo No:2 with LBV port!  Deep purple with purple rims and fast long legs at 19,5% ABV  Candied maraschino cherry and tobacco smoke on the nose!

13193,81371,Lovely jammy porto.
13194,81371,"Nice LBV port from 2008. Sweet raisins and plum, but counterbalanced by eucalyptus"
13195,81371,"It might be the 'poor man's vintage port', but LBVs can be judged on their own merit. Unlike Vintage Port (aged for 2yrs), aged 4-6yrs in larged wooden vats, giving it immediate accessibility. This was aged 6yrs in toneis, and bottled in Dec 2013. 91g/l residual Sugar.  Nose: cherry jam. Fresh red berries+oxidative chocolaten.  Palate: quite tannic. Strawberry jam with some raspberry. Aftertaste dominated by he intensity of fig. Quite heavy+hot. Alcohol gives a hot impression, but the good acidity focused."
13196,81371,"2008 was not a particular good harvest in Douro region..but this LBV says otherwise. Dark ruby color, ripe red fruits, mint, chocolate. Sweetness and acidity well balanced."
13197,81371,"Deep red-purple, lovely nose of wet raisins - thick, rich, round - nice warmth - blackberries, blueberries, a few cranberries, a single damson - not the massive power of a young vintage port, but complex flavours and a long finish - this can only get better."
13198,81371,Love this!  Blackberries and cherries and spice.  A little vanilla.  Smooth tannins and amazing finish.
13199,81371,"Black fruit  and red fruit, mixed together with not overpowering sweetness. Ripeness on flavour but not bold in your mouth. Not a port expert so difficult to say, I really enjoyed with sacher torte. "

13205,6250172,"[Quinta do Portal Winery Visit] While waiting for the winemaker this fresh rosé prepared our palate. Floral and subtle nose with red berry and citrus followed by a palate starting watery but then evolving to expressive, bright acidity with loads of fresh red fruit. 3.6"

Good balance between acidity and body. Creamy, light toast, oaky but very good all together.  💰 Great Price/Quality ✅"
13246,1167128,"Pale yellow color. Ripe tropical fruit aroma, with mineral nuances. In the taste it is unctuous, fresh, elegant and with toasted notes resulting from the fermentation in French oak barrels. In my opinion they slightly overlap the fruit. Persistent finish. excellent value for money."

Pale lemon. Nose of grapefruits, tropical fruits like mango, papaya & pineapple, vanilla, white flowers & honey. Dry, oak flavor dominant and masks other fruits flavor. Med acidity expands from middle palate to finish. Med body & length. On day 1, too oaky & little unbalanced but on day 2, the flavor gets more integrated."
13248,1167128,Very buttery and heavy white but a decent level of acidity and easily drinkable. At 9.99 euros very decent value.

13265,1705731,"A lot of fruit on the nose and palate, almost reaching ""bomb"" status. A full body red showing the flavours and the colours of the same grapes of the Douro DOC that you will also find on your Port wine. Solid and powerful but not standing out that much."
13266,1705731,Decent red. Very light
13267,1705731,"3.7 grand. Got better after the first bottle, as most do. Had at Eddie's dinner in July '18"
13268,1705731,"A blend of 4 Portuguese varietals, not exactly my type or, maybe, a bad bottle. Dark fruits in nose, but with some ketonic hints. Mild tannins, medium acidity, long end but a little too bitter. So, the “buts” takes it to 3 ⭐️"
13269,1705731,"Elegant nose, nice structure, well balanced acidity. The character of Douro."
13270,1705731,"Body, cherry, good with food"
13271,1705731,jan20 Um blend regular. 🇵🇹 POR 
13272,1705731,Simple but pleasant and correct. Good year. Cheers! 
13273,1705731,"Beautifull full body, red fruits with a nice dry finish. "
13274,1705731,"Très belle surprise ! Force et rondeur , super bon moment 3.8"
13275,4739785,"My compliments to Douro red...with spicy chocolate and blackberries wih bluebnerries, delicate and balanced. Long finish, fine aromas...cheers! 🍷"
13276,4739785,"Quite extracted and tanning but showing great personality with a nice balanced minerality. I believe it benefit from a few months in bottle. Very floral, expressing a very fresh fruit driven profile"
13277,4739785,"Frutado, amadurecido e encorpado."
13278,4739785,"Dark colour, fresh nose, mouthful with spice and chocolate with living tannins and long finish. "
13279,4739785,Need some aeration before drinking. Very good after it.
13280,4739785,"Dark purple color, need some time open but than well balanced, full bodied with nice tannins "
13281,4739785,A tough Douro. Marked tannins but harmonious. Lack some  elegance and developed nose. Maybe in 2-4 years? 16.5p. 15 E
13282,4739785,"Requires breathing, berries, spice flavor. Dark red, strong finish."
13283,4739785,"Fresco, intenso, superior"
13284,4739785,"Profound purple colour. Pronounced aromas, black fruits, blackberries, blueberries, plums, some jam, floral, violets, some smoke. Young wine. Dry, high acidity, high alcool and tannins, full body, pronounced flavour intensity, black fruits, smoke, some toast, flowers, ash. Like a pinotage. Long finish. Can drink now but has ageing potential."
13285,4739785,"Really packs a punch: spicy, dark fruit, smokey, reminiscent of an Australian Shiraz or southern French Grenache. Pepper"
13286,4739785,"This will be our first organic wine, and ok douro, nice color, ok finish"
13287,4739785,"Bought directly from the spot, very good round balance!"
13288,4739785,A sneak preview of @[1|4638690|Connie & Ross]'s Alphabet Q wine for this week. We snuck into the bottle the night before. Beautiful full bodied red. Huge bouquet. Lovely deep dark color in the glass. Mostly dark fruit with a little pepper. A beauty.
13289,4739785,"Dark red colour with some tropical fruit aroma and some floral notes. Great tannis, intense aroma and medium body. Fresh and pleasant after tasting."
13290,1216997,3.7 - cherry blackberry some chocolate 
13291,1216997,"Classic ""old-world"" taste at a fabulous price. Let it breathe (or decant). Deep burgundy red, with a hint of tawny color. Full bodied and better with food. "
13292,1216997,"I live near Portalegre, so I thought it was about time I dug this out to try - quite a soft and gentle drop - purple/red - nice balance - dark fruits - fair finish - nice wine at this price, but nothing worth surrendering your first born for. 4 hour decant."
13293,1216997,"Very good Portuguese wine! It became excellent after breathing for 2h. Round, smooth on the palate and intense on the nose. "
13294,1216997,A good Alentejo wine. It would be better weren't the presence of Trincadeira's grape so noticed in this wine.
13295,1216997,Very good wine for the price. 
13296,1216997,"Great structure, fruity notes, médium bodied, sweet taste."
13297,1216997,"Full heavy wine, good balance, great aftertaste"
13298,1216997,Complex but too smooth
13299,1216997,Full bodied and full flavoured 
13300,1216997,"Sweetness in the nose like dried figues, also notes of coffee. Very rich in general. It needs to breathe to get the whole taste, but compared to the nose, it's rather disappointing. Light cherry and doesn't last long. Anyway a good price/quality relation as for most portuguese wines. A 3.4 quote."
13301,1216997,🇵🇹 encontro com @[1|41641250|Jorge Damas] e @[1|25778268|Tiago Faustino].  🇬🇧 meeting with @[1|41641250|Jorge Damas]  and @[1|25778268|Tiago Faustino].
13302,1216997,"Peppery to the palate, with very fine oaky finish. Try this with spicy food, specially bbq’ed hot Italian sausages. You’re welcome."
13303,1216997,"Dry, not overpowering. Good to pair with food. "
13304,1216997,"Not bad for its' price, not bad at all. Quite soft, tender, not very dry, alcohol taste is very mild. Not an outstanding wine but indeed good."
13305,2249914,"All of you wise people know this for sure, but just to state the obvious: go to Portugal for good value! Filipa Pato tje daughter of renowned pioneer Luis Pato and doing well with the Baga grape her father is famous for. This is like quality Beaujolais in a warm vintage! Pretty, floral funky earthy fresh nose. On the palate really crisp and fresh dark berry fruit, floral, and leafy, herbal notes, great acidity and concentration and just very drinkable. Went very well with a nice Guinness and beef stew 😎"
13306,2249914,Pomegranate blueberry cherry subdued into a hearty mushroom. Bright fruit but spices and mysterious. 
13307,2249914,The nose is rather subtle. On the palate the wine is slim and fine with a lot of sour cherry and a good grip.
13308,2249914,"Very fruit forward. Medium dry +. Very mild oak.  Cherry, blackcurrant, black cherry, the inside of plum, and buttery toast on the nose. Earthy, mushroom- y, sour cherry- ish, a little floral (?) like lilac on the tongue. As it gets more air, theres an essence of apricot. A fantastic and versatile wine. It was surprising given it wasn’t very complex. A soft and surprising delight. (3.9) "
13309,2249914,Medium body with some brightness and spice. Great buy
13310,2249914,Had this in Lisbon. Light bodied. 
13311,2249914,Medium to Full bodied. Top of revolving restaurant in Tampere 
13312,2249914,Pateo Jose Avillez Portugal Lisbon. A little smoky. Light to medium bodied 
13313,2249914,"Fantastic for the price point. Sour cherries, soft tannins."
13314,2249914,"Light, Cherry, acidic with good length. Slight fizz? Served lightly chilled. "
13315,2249914,"What a contrast between nose and palate: loads of vanilla and ripe cherry, at a time pinchy acidic, throwing fizz when touching the tongue (I was warned!). Later on: reveals pyrazines (green veggies), calms down its effervescence. Later on: it's all mint, substantial tannins emerge. Later on: returns to vanilla and cherry, still retaining mint and juiciness. Not your usual red."
13316,2249914,"This is a not a complex wine. Another organic excitement that lacks subtly or depth. It has that non sulphate fizz,      Fruity for sure but lacks definition. Too expensive and another example of organic being a long way off from the final product  .  3.6 84pts "
13317,2249914,"Really pretty nose - varied bouquet of dark fruit and red fruit - blueberries, sour cherry, pomegranate, wild strawberry. But also herbaceous. Vine leaf (like dolmades). Light in body but with a crisp acidity and tannic bite. Quite like it drinking how it is right now. Just drinking it on its own which is fine, but would also offset a nice rich Mediterranean stew pretty nicely I imagine. "
13318,2249914,"Schote, Essen  Light oak aroma, medium body cherry earthy oak,light tannin, easy to drink, weak finish"
13319,2249914,"Nose has black cherry, earthy and floral notes. On the palate i tasted bright red fruits with medium acidity and low tannins, very structured and refined. Not at all what I was expecting g from a Baga. Serve chilled and air out for optimal experience! Paired with focaccia, veggie burger and salad — delish pairing. "
13320,1171568,"Dry, leather, full bodied, not earthy, did I say dry? Really works well with food (oily, meaty). Dare I say good with oily fish?"
13321,1171568,"This easy to gulp, fruity, no frills red was a crowd pleaser and paired well with chips and a lukewarm game but I bet it would have tasted even better if paired with CR7."
13322,1171568,"Aging helped creating a powerful, well-balanced red wine with red fruits & soft tannines. Excellent to pair with strong dish (deer, lamb)."
13323,1171568,"Great example of how pleasing the reds of Alentejo, Portugal are. Very fruity on the nose, black currant taking the prime spot. More subtle on the palate, with sour cherry and good amount of both approachable tannins and acidity."
13324,1171568,"Very good red from Alentejo, Portugal. Intense and limpid red color. Fruity nose with blackberries and black cherries with leather and bittersweet notes. In mouth, average body, tamed tannins lacking more personality. Black fruit flavors honoring nose with a good lasting finish gifting an interesting bittersweet black fruit aftertaste. Paired well with our friday night’s pizza at my daughter’s house in father’s day weekend! Cheers!"
13325,1171568,One of my go to Alentejo wines
13326,1171568,"Simple flavor, floral, dry , like it "
13327,1171568,"Ruby red, deep but not too fruity . Was paired with pork belly which worked. "
13328,1171568,"Pleasant Alentejo full of juicy flavours of red berries and forrest fruits.  In the mouth medium bodied with med tannins, little bit spicy at the end, smooth and mild. "
13329,1171568,"Decent portugese red, with good structure, tannins, and a lot of fruit (blackcurrant). It feels like a wine from a hot place, is low on acidity. Paired greatly with grilled lamb. Recommended."
13330,1171568,"A good above average wine. Aroma of ripe cherries and tobacco. In mouth, mild tannins,  must be aerated for 1 or 2 hours, it does get better.A blend of 4 traditional Portuguese varietals (Alicante, Aragonez, Trincadeira and Touriga Nacional), milder than the other vintages I tried. My second of this vintage, same opinion."
13331,1171568,"Very nice Alentejo Tinto blend of 4 native Portugal grapes at the price of around 6.5 euros. Big body and extractivity, beautiful ripe red fruit aromas, also round tannin and medium acidity. Medium/long aftertaste. 3.6 pts !!"
13332,1171568,"Actually too young to drink it but I couldn't resist to taste it so young. Quite intense aromas of berries and currants of both colours black and red with slightly overweighing black colour with good vanilla and spicy nuances. On the palate medium bodied with firm and slightly still rough tannins. Flavours of blackcurrants, cheeries, blackberries that merge to jammy touch with well integrated spicy and woody nuances with touch of tobacco. Very promising in next years. Medium finish with fruity aftertaste."
13333,1171568,"3.7⭐️. The producer shows its quality with this very good basic wine . Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez, Trincadeira and Touriga Nacional are the grapes used. Complex aromas of cedar, flowers (violets), mint, spices (clove) and plums. Full body, good tannins (and a young wine), well balanced. The atomas notes remainson the palate, and the finish is medium. Great for a daily basis."
13334,1171568,"Pretty similar to the 2013 proposal, this is proper dark red (to almost purple) wine for oily meats. The nose is again with a predominant blackcurrant touch, but this time the vanilla is replaced by a more distinctive leather feeling. The body is on the bold side, with mild acidity to it. A slight touch of sour red fruit and cherry is to be felt. The finish is dry, but fulfilling. Perfect for oily meat or medium-rare steaks!"
13335,2241262,"Soft to start, opened up to be earthy and moderate spicy, excellent wine and worth the wait."
13336,2241262,Nothing special for the price
13337,2241262,Fruity fresh and smooth. Liked
13338,2241262,"Cherry, cassis, blackberry, touch of smokiness, spicy."
13339,2241262,Fruity and powerfull
13340,18474,"A pure stunner. A firmer more black fruit style of Portuguese wines with good quality oak showing it's TRUE colours. What a wine, winemaking at its best! super long finish. "
13341,18474,Lovely! My style. Cherry notes. 
13342,18474,Beautiful big wine
13343,18474,"Still very youthful, this concentrated wine has structure and black fruit flavors and intense acidity. Its wood aging offers an extra spice note and a polished surface.  Underneath, the wine is dense."
13344,18474,"I’ve been curious for a while to try this wine from Quinta do Portal: Auru, a blend of 55% Touriga Nacional, 40% Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo) and 5% Touriga Franca is only made in special years, like 2011 was in basically the whole of Portugal, even more in Douro region.👃🏻 Ripe dark fruit, like blackberries, followed by chocolate, fruit jelly, eucalyptus, anise and spices.👅 Powerful, opulent, mouth filling, with high tannins, but rounded and velvety. Blueberries, blackcurrants, jam, oregano and licorice. 4.5⭐️"
13345,18474,"Top 5! Excellent wine!  Aurus 2009, from Quinta do portal. Nose and palate is changing every time we taste it. Red fruit and chocolate are the most prominent."
13346,18474,"I can understand the high score for this wine. It is huge and big. And so alive for 8 years after vintage!!! Amazing. But not my style, therefore cannot give 5 stars...hehe"
13347,18474,The doors to a good wine
13348,18474,"One of Quinta do Portal’s best wines! Stayed there last March, it’s beautiful! This wine is so concentrated and full of flavors!  Chocolate, black cherry, vanilla, cassis and blackberry on the nose. Toast, more black cherry and vanilla on the palate with cocoa on the finish. Long finish. Very good."
13349,18474,Superb balanced and intense. Can't describe the beauty. No wonder why it was 2004 award best wine. Only with red meat
13350,18474,"Superior wine, extremely robust and velvety after decanting."
13351,80417,"Luscious caramel, coffee, dried fruit and whisky aromas. Beautiful on the palate, creamy and coffee, raisin driven sweetness with beautiful acidity that keeps it balanced and elegant. Lovely Port"
13352,80417,Caramel Raisins Toffee
13353,80417,"Very nice Port, a perfect balance between acidity and sweetness. Caramel. Metal."
13354,80417,Beautiful tawny vintage. Lots of fruit and freshness. 
13355,80417,"One of the best ports I’ve had outside the UK. Smooth, mildly sweet. Perhaps a tiny bit thin."
13356,80417,"This is clean and mild for a port! Beautiful clear toffee flavours. Mandarin up front, hazelnut comes through underneath. All the bite is reserved for the finish. A little smoky, quite a bit acidic. Surprise booziness. Pleasant and distinctive."
13357,80417,"Caramel, toffee and deep butterscotch, screams to be paired with stinky cheese. Good all round port"
13358,80417,Personally I don’t like port so it’s a testament to how good this is that I had the whole glass. 
13359,80417,No notes taken.
13360,80417, caramel toffee honey cherry
13361,80417,"The joy of discovery. My first Colheita which is a single vintage tawny port aged in cask for 8 years, often longer. Pale ruby, almost brownish hues. Alluring oxidized aromas of cocoa powder, walnuts, coffee, chocolate consistent with the flavours on the palate. Good weight and balance and oh-so-drinkable.   I could get used to this."
13362,80417,"Figs, Madeira-plums, sweet tobacco, oxidative notes, walnuts, toasted almonds, and some spices. A little tannin and some acidity to keep it fresh. Great QPR. "
13363,80417,Dried figs notes all over. Very nice. 
13364,80417,"Raisins, dried plums, fruit bread and a hint of lemon peel. Lovely port wine, excellent match to chocolaty desserts or fruits."
13365,80417,chocolate. Nutty. Vanilla. Oak. Cola. Toffee. Caramel. I thought the single harvest was better than the 20 year tbh.
13366,1950627,Nice crisp white - a bit high in acidity for my taste 
13367,1950627, vanilla plum chocolate cherry oak
13368,1950627,"Full- bodied, aromas of plum and dark fruit, firm tannins. Pairs well with lamb. "
13369,1950627,"Very good value. I’ve always loved Spanish wine, and now I’m learning how much I also really like Portuguese wine. Full bodied, lots of black plum but also cherry and vanilla. Big fan. "
13370,1950627,"Yummy! Dark, black cherries in dark chocolate... full bodied taste. Vanilla & plums , bit of a woody aftertaste as well. More! "
13371,1950627,"Great Dāo wine. Intense flavours black currants, cherry, licquorice, chocolate flakes, lactic note and medium tannins  Wonderful wine from granite soil Grape Touriga Nacional "
13372,1950627,A clear 4.25 in my book!
13373,1950627,"Smooth, light oak and hints of chocolate "
13374,1950627,"Intense and rich, with a deep well of dark plum, dried blackberry and dried beef flavors, featuring plenty of leafy and underbrush notes. Focused midpalate, with Asian spice and slate details.  "
13375,1950627,"Spice and darker fruits on nose. Get your vanilla notes. Mouth is good balance of fruit, acidity and tannins. Wine is reminiscent  of a Beaujolais. Bit more bossy and structure. Slightly chilled and will open up. "
13376,1950627,"The Dão region shows here clearly it's soul!  'Sous-bois' of pine trees and rather red fruit and tobacco as aromas, in a dark ruby wine! Flavours of tobacco and dark chocolate along with wild cherries and o touch of spices. Very nice and nearly at the spot of drinking, nice smooth but long acidity."
13377,1950627,Frutado encorpado e sem final 
13378,1950627,"smooth and flawless medium body  nectar intense dry but not agressivo flavour, easy to drink and to enjoy excellent top notch price to quality ratio "
13379,1950627,"Dão Masterclass shortnotes: 3.9. Ripe banana, spice bix, cassis, good length with graphite."
13380,1950627,"Fabulous Portuguese red … dry, full bodied with oak, raspberry and red fruits. Need to eat with a red meat or cheese to match. Drunk in Lisbon. "
13381,1984940,"Clear gold colour. Complex fruit aromas. Off dry, fresh acidity with a medium body. Integrated stone fruit flavours. Well balanced with a long finish. A very nice wine. 16/20."
13382,1984940,Regular. Redondo e fresco.
13383,1984940,Light fruit. Very nice lunch wine
13384,1984940,"Good balanced wine. Bodyfull taste, though not very long lasting. "

13386,1984940,"Reminds me of a smooth pino grigio, lights fruits fun"
13387,1984940,"Intensive gold colour, pronounced aroma of ripen tropical fruits. Full bodied, but still fresh in mouth. Long finish."
13388,1984940,"3,7. Brightly- chocolate, cherry in the chocolate, figs - matured, dried and jammed. A bit lacks acidity but with strong tannins"
13389,1984940,"Herdade do Peso, garantido."
13390,1984940,Fresh apple and pear taste. Well balanced acidity. Perfect to drink either on it's own or with light dishes.
13391,1984940,Great One for the price if you like Spanish and Portuguese wine. 
13392,1984940,"Stone fruit nose with green apple, lemon, pear, and slight mineral notes. Pale in color with obvious green hues. Medium acidity, green apple, pear and melon body. Clean short finish. 3.7 stars."

13394,1984940,Medium Intense nose of flowers and citrus and tropical. Discrete (partial ageing in oak). In the mouth has a volume and medium acidity. Good balance!
13395,1984940,Fair support for seafood.
13396,95919,Full well balanced wine. Notes of Apple which gives it a sweet after taste. Soft & complex. It was very good value. Great with grilled chicken. 
13397,95919,"Really fresh, interesting aftertaste, but I can’t really name the exact tastes, except pointing out melon. It doesn’t really smell in any particular way."
13398,95919,Lively acidity and pleasant citrus notes. Great value for 💰 
13399,95919,"Melon 🍈, Apple 🍏, a bit of citrus 🍊 🍋 notes. Crispy, medium bodied. Nothing special, but it's a good value (in Poland at least)."
13400,95919,"little acidic, really good quality/ price ratio. "
13401,95919,Quite good. I bought it very cheep. 
13402,95919,"Very nice, fresh wine with smooth end but strong."
13403,95919,"Very young, but very good wine, with perfect QPR. Slightly green colour. The palate heavy or rather oily. Hints of melon on the nose. Slightly sweet finish with pepper at the very end. I paired it with pancakes, medium sweet dish. Maybe it was not perfect, but did well enough. "
13404,95919,Fresh citrus ( lime mango) nose; mouth follows the nose + some bitter sweet notes unripe pineapple; drinkable 
13405,95919,Not bad Loios

13410,95919,Great price point! Light and fruity!
13411,1584422,"Good assertive, unfaltering aromas of damsen and vanilla.   Great fruit concentration on the nose and palate.  Raging acidity.  Well integrated tannins and oak.  Good length (albeit a little shy)  A well made wine."
13412,1584422,"5th wine in a row that I try from this winery and this is the first that really impressed me: its alentejo but on a smoother way, with the ripe plums, black cherry but also great acidity, soft tannins, elegant. Well done!"
13413,1584422,"Another fantastic antelejo wine that shows great intensity and complexity;  Fantastic bouquet of red cherries, cassis, black cherries and violets  Full bodied with rich dense tannins, notes of ripe plums, cherries, casssis, and sweet spices Medium acidity  Medium long finish"
13414,1584422,"Well done Alenteano wine...full bodied and dry with black cherries aromas, oaky notes, rich & deep. Good price for value! 🍷"

13419,1584422,Nice and easy going with good steak
13420,1584422,"Rich and full bodied. Deep scarlet colour. Attracts your nose when you smell it. Bright acidity but lovely. Good value for money, around HK$110. Yet another great Portugal red wine. "
13421,1584422,Good mouthfeel. Fruity and slightly dry
13422,1584422,Best slurped in the company of drunkards :-) 
13423,1584422,"Excellent full bodied wine at 6 years. Not suitable for fish, even bacalhau, despite what the label says."
13424,1584422,"Deep, rich colour, full bodied. Nice complexity and long finish. Great with a hearty meal."
13425,1584422,"Fullt loaded with black frukt, Cherry in a nice Magnum bottle. Rather strong acid with shy but distinct tannins. 3,8"
13426,1105372,Really like Esporão wines - at this proce range a lush blend of indigenous grapes - looking forward to blend this with the nadi goreng tonight to create east meets west.
13427,1105372,Worldwide available; not expensive and....really good; elegant nose- dark fruits; dark chocolate; cedar box; mouth- blueberry; blackberries; dark cherry; dark chocolate; hint of species; extremely drinkable; fantastic QPR 
13428,1105372,"Great value and not what I would have expected from my first wine from Portugal. It is something between a fruity Italian wine and a peppery Australian Shiraz. Red berry nose with strong fruit blast on palette, hint of chocolate and pepper on finish with smooth tannins."
13429,1105372,"Deep ruby hue, nose of wet slate and dried blueberry, opens with pop of cherry and plum, but dries out with cedar, tobacco, graphite and hints of mint.  Such a unique red blend from southern Portugal. What a nice surprise. "
13430,1105372,Very fruity as you’d expect from the grape varieties. No real complexity just an easy drinking quaffable Wine. 
13431,1105372,The Shiraz balances the more tart varietals to give a wine that punches well above it’s weight considering the price range. 
13432,1105372,"Lighter, with a very slight acidic tannin that will definitely tamp down with a little time.  Cherry note, but not too strong and a mild finish.  "
13433,1105372,"Fruity and light, lacks complexity but very good anyway"
13434,1105372,Final de baunilha . Bastante intenso 
13435,1105372,It was just great
13436,1105372,Great with paella 🥘 & seafood 🦞 
13437,1105372,"Needs some time, lighter than other alentejano bros"
13438,1105372,Bold red Alenrejano Portuguese wine. Nice fruity nose with tannin. Yummy wine. 
13439,1105372,Repeating . Nothing to add from previous evaluation.
13440,1105372,"Dark purple in color. Notes of blackberry and dark chocolate on nose and palate. Dry, med body, nice acidity, smooth tannins. Nice Portuguese wine."
13441,5006500,"Great wine! Too young!    It can wait 30+ years more, the wine not me! 😉  It is a rich blend of touriga national and franca, and tinta roriz and barroca!   It's a great example of Blackett quality winemaking!    Cheers !"
13442,5006500,"4.1 90p. Rather rich and spicy Vintage Port with ripe sour cherries, black currant and some oak in the background.   High acidity and strong tannins.   Still very young, but really nice. Probably good ageing potential.   Labelled as Blackett, but Vivino only knows it as Alchemy Wines (?).  10(+)"
13443,5006500,Awesome nice port
13444,5006500,We can wait more 40 years to taste but we can't afford to wait for a uncertain future. So let's enjoy the present and the moment.  Great wine! 
13445,5006500, blackcurrant sour cherry oak
13446,22302,"Bold, dry and smooth with blackberries, raspberries and other black and red fruits. Enjoyable and worth buying again. Goes well with steak and surely most foods. "
13447,22302,"Well this one is peculiar!! But good to say the least.  👃 where comes the peculiar part, smells heavily like rubber or wet leather with strong grass notes and a touch of plum. The aroma is definitely the strong point of this wine.  🍷 smooth like a sheet of silk but not creamy, with almost no sweetness, a harsh and dry sensation, good and profound tannins and a strong aftertaste. "
13448,22302,"Very good red! Dark red, vanilla and cherry on the nose. Nice tannins, well balanced. So good overall!"
13449,22302,"Good balance, needs breathing to lower some acidity. Medium finish with red fruit and strawberry aromas"
13450,22302,Intenso e encorpado 
13451,22302,"🇵🇹 almoço de Natal. Escolha do meu pai. Feito com Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Sousão, Tinto Cão e Tinta Roriz. Agradável.  🇬🇧 Christmas lunch. My father's choice. Made with Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Sousão, Tinto Cão and Tinta Roriz. Nice wine."

13454,22302,Super encorpado. Ótima surpresa 
13455,22302,"Fruity, bold, a bit dry. Good."

13461,1224078,good though not quite as dry as I'd like it to be
13462,1224078,Good wine for the price.
13463,1224078,Spicy good value 4 money
13464,1224078,Very mellow. Great with game (venison) as recommended. Not a port wine. Blend of Portuguese grapes that I need to learn more about.
13465,1224078,"tinta, touriga .. red fruit, smooth tannins"
13466,1224078,"Final longo, estruturado"
13467,1224078,To be clear ( difficult for a Tinto): no port wine but pretty decent red. Recent aging has no influence. Dry bodied wine with some dark fruits. Tanines present but not too much. Roriz with some touriga nacional and franca ( think latter it s Portugese cabernet). White meat & cheese lovers will appreciate
13468,1224078,"a v good fortified wine. still super fresh. great style, still vibrant berry flavours. "
13469,1224078,Fruity with plum and caramel 
13470,1224078,Smooth and full bodied.
13471,1224078,An excellent value for the price. Maintains some fruity brightness and drinks more like an LBV than many other Colheitas
13472,1224078,Excellent avec filet de bison grille
13473,1224078,"Plums, almonds.. Full bodied"
13474,1224078,Very smooth for a douro wine
13475,1224078,Dried red berry nose. Finish is quite dry too with some interesting tannins
13476,76378,"Outstanding, I am not experienced enough to really say. However this is by far one of the best experiences I have had with ANY wine. Mind-blowing"
13477,76378,"Not really a port specialist, but this is really good, is it worth 1500 DKK, nope! My rule of thumb regarding port is to go for 40 years or more, then you're safe"
13478,76378,"I don’t drink a lot of port but maybe I should pick up the pace cause this is mind blowing excellent, walnut caramel creme brûlée dry apricot raisin, but the palate/texture is even better cause it’s not fat lazy and killing you softly sweet, nope it’s beautifully balanced with more crisp caramel apricot coffee toffee with kick ass acidity that keeps it alive and kicking. Wow 😮 "
13479,76378,"100 rating!!!!! OMG soooo complex. No where near dead. Vibrant sweetness and acidity with lovely light fruit and amazing maturity. Beautiful dark golden, caramel color. Notes of roasted nuts, caramel, dried fruit, fig, prunes, yellow plum, dates, raisins, oak, chocolate and vanilla. Holy shit this was a mind blowing experience. "
13480,76378,"4.9 96p. Brown with a slightly green edge. Strong, complex and deep. Dried apricots, vanilla, violets, dark chocolate, walnuts and well integrated oak. Well balanced acidity and sweetness and a constantly evolving, lingering finish. Choose 1966 or 1985, if you want to optimize QPR.  13-"
13481,76378,"Amazing. Out of this World. Spectacular. Walnuts, leather, dried plums and sexyness."
13482,76378,I am into port from now
13483,76378,This is fantastic :-)
13484,76378,A Masterpiece.  97/100.     Jamie Goode.

13488,76378,Klasse! By far the best port wine!!!
13489,76378,"First aha-experience with portwine. Deep intense, yet so subtle. Multi layered. Anyone who wants to go the extra mile for eg Christmas holidays this is the way to go"
13490,76378,This is completely madness! From 1937 and so damn well tasting! Amazing.
13491,5971322,For you who Port this one doesn’t need further introduction - just good stuff. Drink it now ....  I am sure it will be better in a couple of years if ....🙄🤫 
13492,5971322," Very fresh and super-fruity nose of blackberries, blueberries, red cherries and white pepper. Then greener notes of fresh herbs, mint and even... pine tree? Bit strange. Very sweet but well balanced by fine tannins and acidity. Maybe just a bit simple and a slightly flat finish. 89-91p"
13493,5971322,Too young in December 2018. Bland and sweet 
13494,5971322,"A fine VP. Mulberries, dried cherries and spice. A good wack of tannins and acid. Pleasant savory notes at the end."
13495,5971322,"96/100 From the Vintage Port 2016 tasting. More of a medium bodied Port. It's herbal, floral, with plum, pencil lead, raspberry, and cherry. Juicy and bright acidity with firm tannins. This has it all, the complexity, acidity, and structure. What a masterful wine. "
13496,5971322,All the things I like in a young vintage 
13497,5971322,Lovely young Port. A little sweet. 🍷🍷🍷🍷
13498,5971322,"2.5, disappointed. Flat, no sweetness to it. "
13499,5971322,"A powerful wine characterized by a rich, almost black color and long-lasting flavors of ripe plum, cherry and nuts."
13500,76031,"Center Parcs holiday:  N: blackcurrant, jam, blackberry and bramble. Hint of smoke   T: blackcurrant, plum, cherry and strawberry. Subtle oak "
13501,76031,"Great value for money. A solid and always reliable choice. A good Dão blend, with red fruit, some vanilla and spices. Average after mouth"
13502,76031,"Amazing table wine! Earthy aromas of Black cherry syrup, cedar and rosemary. Amazing value for the price and velvety mouth feel."
13503,76031,"The second time I drink it, after 3 months, it seems better. Deep red color, full body, red and black fruits, a bit sweet on the palate, strong aftertaste. It gave good fit with the fish dinner. "
13504,76031,"Iberuly🇪🇸🇵🇹#5 and this fruity Dao red was the bottle that took me thru Sunday’s second half, ET and penalty shoot out. Like England by that stage it was OK but not great. A blend of traditional local Portuguese grapes Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Alfrocheiro, it’s a mid week quaffing kinda wine. Medium bodied, medium tannin, fresh and quite acidic with fruit flavours of cherry & blackberry. Finished it off, consoling ourselves with post match late night bacon sandwiches. 3.5⭐️ Congrats to the Azzurri 🇮🇹 👏👏"
13505,76031,This was a real surprise!  I picked it up because it was cheap and I needed to make up enough to get the discount from the wine store. Smooth with lots of mellow fruit. Good body and woody notes. I’ve tasted much worse for twice the price. 
13506,76031,"3,6⭐A classic Red from Dão. 30 to 60 min of aeration did it good. 🍇T. Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro. 👀Dark garnet. Scarse and blurry tears. 👃Intense on the red fruit, mainly cherry. But also some plum, licorice and pepper. 👅Balanced, medium body, dry. Smooth given the low tannins and medium acidity. Medium finish with the spices in the aftertaste. 🗒️Well made with an ok complexity and definitely gastronomic. Good PQR, gets the job done well considering the price (~3€)."
13507,76031,"Surprised, having in mind the price of the bottle.  👃 very fresh, expected of a young wine, floral, with pepper, cherry and vanilla notes.  🍷 smooth like silk, well balanced, medium acidity and good tannins. Perfect for the Christmas and New Year’s Eve. "
13508,76031,The scent of walking through a warm and dark forest which matches in a funny way with the black forest cake smooth cherry flavour. Rounded tannins and a sweet aftertaste. A pleasant surprise for as low of a price as wines get where I live.
13509,76031,"This Red wine opens with a nose of Strawberry licorice and Floral. It is dry with soft tannins and vanilla spice. Flavors of Strawberry, Dark Cherry, Raspberry, Oak and Vanilla. Nice value wine. Have a Great Sunday and Cheers to all my wine friends. 🍷🍷🍷"
13510,76031,"The Portuguese evening went well and I enjoyed the pickled octopus followed by peri peri prawns. Vasco red was introduced, as the rest of the group had spicy offal on couscous with beans. I was pleasantly surprised in this dark smooth peppery and cherry taste in a  blend of Portuguese reds. Easy tannins and a distant musty and leathery hint. Value for money, and I will try again."
13511,76031,"Limited tasting notes. From what I remember, this was dry and fruit forward, with green pepper notes. Well worth the price! "
13512,76031,"Slightly young naturally, quite fruity, short, dry finish. "
13513,76031,Good money for the value. Solid wine.
13514,76031,Young Portugal with raspberry and cherry with some cedar on the finish.

13517,1197144,"Nose of red and black berries, pepper and mint. Not too sweet with good bitterness and firm tannins. Tightly knit. This should evolve well for 10+ years or more. 92-94p"
13518,1197144,Nose of brandied cherries and clove. Lusciously sweet concentrated dark fruit and vanilla on the palate. Straightforward and lovely on a cold evening.

13522,1197144,"[Portugal Trip 2018/03] The last glass of the trip was a good one, easily overcoming quite strong cheese. Rich nose with wood, red fruit and prunes, balanced taste with tannines nicely framing the sweetness."
13523,1197144,"Drinking Quinta do Bomfim vintage port on Quinta do Bomfim, priceless! A tad more elegant nose compared to Warre's Cavadinha vintage 2001. Eucalyptus. Well balanced palate. Burst of blackberries. More drier than Graham's Malvedos vintage 2004. Great stuff!"
13524,1197144,Lovely balance of sweetness and acidity together with a lovely bite of brandy and chewy tannins. Strawberry in a jam like way that also feels a little eucalyptus. There is also a little mushrooms and nuts...
13525,1197144,"Still very dark. Plum nose with wood and something herbal. Peppery in the mouth at first. Then a plum preserve with flowers, blackberries and even a hint of strawberries.  Long and very powerful. Great for drinking now."
13526,1197144,"This is a Portugal wine. Vintage Port. Mix of few Portugal domestic variety Tinta Roriz · Tinta Barroca · Touriga Nacional · Touriga Franca. On eye: deep cloudy ruby. On nose: characteristic Port nose sensation with touch of old wood. On nose: nicely balanced acidity and sweetness. Nicely aging Port. Noble and stable in expression. My rating is stable 4⭐️ (4,1)"
13527,1197144,"Quality vintage port with a lot of years left in it. Almost black and ink coloured this port shows up nicely in the glass with good viscosity. Intense licorice nose with al deeper floral scent. Palate also has intense licorice, but also lavender and vanilla. Aftertaste is lasting as the port coates your mouth. Very nice vintage port that does not require that you spend your life savings."
13528,1197144,"Very clean port, dark notes, fruity, smooth."
13529,1197144,Clear quality and still plenty of years in it. A little more sweet-dominated than it could.
13530,1179680,Have to go four on this one!  Dense with intensity of a young ruby port together with the character and spice of an older tawny ...drank at Quinta do sexio
13531,1179680,"Prune, chocolate and figs on the nose. A cracker"
13532,1179680,Raisins dominate the taste in this one! Brillant! Powerfull and smooth on the palate
13533,1179680,"chocolate dark chocolate dried apricots  Silky smooth, but not very complex yet."
13534,1179680,"A blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca & Tinta Roriz, Vau is a vintage port designed to be drinkable in its youth. Deep garnet. Rich blackberry, blackcurrant, red cherry, raspberry jam. Medium aroma intensity. Youthful. Sweet with cassis and damson black fruits. Liquorice, jammy and rich. High alcohol. This wine has verve and energy. It's freshness belies it's 12 years. Med.+ body, med.(-) velvety tannins, med. acidity. Med.+ finish. Very pleasant but lacking any real complexity."
13535,1179680,"Probably my least favorite vintage port.   Nose of malberries jam, dark blackberries, bright lively evaporative character   Lightly sweet spice of vanilla and cinnamon.   Port wine sweet but lacks some acidity.  Medium body with soft developing ripe sweet tannin.  This will age for 5-7 years more but ready to drink.   The problem is how thin this vintage port is and the finish being medium.   90 pts. Me"
13536,1179680,"Intensely sweet and ripe with raspberry and blackberry fruit. Nice intensity here to the exotic, liqueur-like fruit."
13537,1179680,"Big producer's own decision vintage,  but perfect,  Big fruitiness, acidity, tanins. Elegant,  not so explosive. Long, Good to drink now."
13538,1179680,"Incredibly sweet and flabby at Pop time, this improved after 12 hours - at the raspberry end - simple, always sweet and without much complexity or character - if this is where my stash of 2011s are headed, I'm going to drink them up."
13539,1179680,"Plum, blackberries, spice. Plums and red fruit on the palate together with sweet cherries. Medium body. Very good."

13545,1160653,"3.8   Strong red wine from Portugal.  Very smooth and a sweet flavor.  Unique taste.  Nose is red fruit.  Black fruit, caramel and candied fruit are on the pallette.    Interesting wine, worth trying.  "

13547,1160653,Wow! Dark fruit and very arromatic! Great full body with an excelent depth!

13549,1160653,Always a winner
13550,1160653,"Excellent, bold 16% wine with a great artisanal feel. Nicely acidic, not too strong on tannins. Fruity & aromatic."
13551,1160653,"After another bottle I can say there was a problem on first one. This is a strong wine with really nice flavors, embodied and great ending. I recommend this wine with red meat and a lower drinking temperature."
13552,1160653,"Violet colour, starts strong with notes of blueberry, raspberry, ends fruity and slightly acidic "
13553,1160653,"Lost for words. Develops in you a craving fpr more. Bottle serms to dry quickly, might it be the heat? Full bodied. 2018 harvest almost identical,perhaps better ... constant flavour."
13554,1160653,Pleasant nose with hints of red fruit and wood. Full bodied intense wine. Very long finish in mouth. Not overly fruity with a nice tannic finish (probably the Alfrocheiro). Despite high degree of alcohol (16%!) not overly strong. Excelent price / quality.
13555,1160653,Fruity full bodied flavors well worth the price 
13556,1160653,Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place.....
13557,1160653,"Lovely wine that we drank in Portugal. Full bodied, rich in its flavors of black current and vanilla without being too heavy"
13558,1160653,"Yes I agree with many of the comments, paid a little more it seems than the average for a 2019. "
13559,1160653,Fruity really good price!
13560,2812225,"Yes, the bottle is EMPTY! Enjoyed this dry fruit forward red slightly chilled while floating in the pool! Got this lovely at a little wine shop in Ojai, CA. Perfecto!"
13561,2812225,"Excellent full bodied Touriga Nacional. Bold at first. But as time goes, it became smooth  Very well made wine. Highly recommended !!!!!"
13562,2812225,🇵🇹 Bom Touriga Nacional alentejano. É daqueles vinhos que tinha vontade de experimentar. Não desiludiu.  🇬🇧 Good Touriga Nacional from Alentejo. I wanted to try it for a long time. Very good.
13563,2812225,"Honey berries. Good one TN. 70ha,  Wild yeasts.  Poor land, predominantly of granite. 14%. pH › 3,66. Manual harvest into 12 kg boxes. triaged on a vibrating sorting table, destemmed and lightly crushed. After a 48 hour period of pre-fermentative cold maceration, the fermentation has occurred in french oak barrels. Aging  in french oak barrels 11m. Bottle aging for 3m. Deep ruby and violet colour. Floral notes typical from the grape variety and spicy notes from the barrel aging. Soft and silky tannins.  "
13564,2812225,Ripe berries and plums upfront with an initial jammyness that wanes as the wine opens up. Very smooth mouthfeel and a long finish that has you wanting to take another sip. Not a harsh note in the bottle makes it very easy to drink. A really nice alternative red at a good price.
13565,2812225,"Dark, full bodied red with plum and black currant on the nose. Leather and tobacco are readily identifiable on the palate."
13566,2812225,"Blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, violet. Really nice value. Probably even better in a couple of years. "
13567,2812225,"Leather, tobacco, fruit - nice!"
13568,2812225,Reminded me of cab. Very tannic dry but delicious with the right pairing and if you like that type of wine style.
13569,2812225,"Another great one! Strong blueberry, honey nose. Gentle black fruits, cocoa, expresso, leather, tobacco with medium tannin finish. Beautiful!!"
13570,2812225,"Dark purple, jammy fresh berries and hints of tobacco and cocoa. Balanced but a bit young still.  Keep it for another 3 years. "
13571,2812225,Smells of black fruit and plum with some pleasant flowery scents of violet and mint.  Taste profile is similar with some mild gravely tannins and some chocolate at the finish.  Some oak in there too.  It is well balanced.  Really good wine.
13572,2812225,"Medium-bodied, savory and earthy, rose hip, pomegranate, red currant, sour cherry, pepper, sage, earl grey, lavender, oak, mushroom, tobacco, leather "
13573,2812225,"An intense Portuguese red with deep dark plum and blackberry flavors. Heavier than most tempranillos this wine will taste well even after three days of being open. Will pair with lamb and flank steak or gamey dark meats. Not a lot of bright fruit, so not a wine to have just as a cocktail. "
13574,2812225,"Earthy with notes of milk chocolate and coffee and some plum in the back, this wine is creamy and has balanced acidity.  There's nothing fruity in this wine.  I note the tannins that promote its dryness though they aren't strong.  Vij described this as table wine.  We'll try it again once it opens up.  Day 2 - a very different wine.  The strong plum is prominent and I feel more of the alcohol, acidity and body.  Today it tastes like what I would expect of Alentejo.  So let it open up."
13575,83732,A lot of ripe fruit.  Perfect sweetness in a very well balanced ruby port
13576,83732,Mature port. Almonds and butterscotch on the nose. Medium body with mid finish. Good budget port
13577,83732,Rich and delicate. 
13578,83732,"3 of 5 or 85-89 (Mycket bra, ett vin med speciella kvaliteter / Very good, a wine with special qualities)."
13579,83732,A premium blend with the freshness a vintage shows fresh blueberries 🫐 and hints of eucalyptus 🌿 and gum cistus 
13580,83732,"Light mouth feel, sweet berry flavor "
13581,83732,Fruity and dry - first time for a Duro. Would buy again
13582,83732,"Like all port wines, this one have very dark colour and rich semi complex taste. It contain notes from prune, figs, dark cherry and chocolate. A very good port with potential if stored some more years in the cellar."
13583,83732,Best port wine I ever had
13584,83732,Ripe fruits chocolate tobacco fresh. Love it 
13585,83732,"95/100 From the 2016 Port Vintage declaration tasting. One of the most tannic and structured wine from the vintage, it's built to last. Notes of strawberry rhubarb, cherry, and mocha notes. More on the red fruit spectrum. This is going to be one long lasting wine. "
13586,83732,"Sourced from the Douro Superior & Cima Corgo, a trad field blend trodden in lagares, over-wintered in oak vats at Qta da Gricha & then aged in inox at Vila Nova de Gaia.  Deep ruby. M+ aroma intensity, very ripe & redolent of dark jammy black fruit. Cassis, blackberry, crème de mure, raisin & prune. Youthful w. black cherry coulis & dark chocolate.  Sweet. Rich w. lifted violet. Prune, raisin, crème de mure/cassis & blackberry. High alc, full body, high fine-grained tannins & a spicy long finish w. cocoa."

13589,83732,A lovely sweet red wine 🍷 from Portugal 🇵🇹 it’s fantastic too lovely France 🇫🇷 Swiss 🇨🇭and Spanish 🇪🇸 cheese 🧀 this is really a awesome 👏 port wine 🍷 have a nice weekend 
13590,80415,"Port 💯, and it had to be a Dow's. I had a glass of this last week in Vila Nova de Gaia in the Vintage Room at Graham's. Both producers are part of Symington Family Estates. 25 years old, and this is in a good place. Lovely aroma, prune, fig and raisin, toastiness, liquorice, spice. The balance on the palate is great, rich fruit, tobacco, clove. Smooth, energetic and still rather youthful. It's less sweet than the Graham's vintage ports on the table, and with less apparent acidity. I love Dow's. Cheers! 😀🍷"
13591,80415,"GS & I - PORT CHALLENGE  GS's bottle, this is another Symington owned label and a vintage I had 2 yrs ago via Skype with the Madrids. The winner that night for me, this is still holding fast and will only improve! Thanks GS!  More bricking & structure showing today than the Graham's, this has a bigger nose with black fruits, toffee & chocolate leading to flavors of black plum, fig, petrol & nutmeg. Finely integrated tannins give hints of heat with a long eye closing finish.  93 pts"
13592,80415,"Arrrrrrrrooooooo!  Two 1994 Ports on the same night side by side?  Enough to drive this Port Hound into doggie heaven!  Brought by my friend GS, and served alongside a Graham’s ‘94.

Lovely and balanced.  2018 update:  rusty evil red.Intoxicating nose  of apricot, dark red fruits.  Concord grape and blackberry taste.  Silky.  Lovely.  Nuanced but powerful."
13597,80415,"Purchased on Futures. Last bottle opened in 2012.   One of the best ever from Dow's , this Port remains young. Opaque color with no signs of rust. Prunes, orange peel and a bit of toasted caramel on the nose with plum and raisin in the mouth. Lush and concentrated. This 94 has a long finish. Goes great with pure chocolate topped off with a Habana !  Another great effort from Dow's. It will take a lot of effort to hold the remaining bottles much longer. But this Port seems to have at least 5 more years."
13598,80415,"Very nice vintage port.  Aromas include raisin, vanilla, dark chocolate, cream, maple syrup, and earthy.  A full bodied and tasted with lots of raisins and dry plum.  The bottle once opened is able to last few months for enjoyment.  A perfect desert wine that can serve at cool or at room temperature."
13599,80415,"4.3 1994 was called the best vintage since 1927 with a textbook weather pattern and bottles that should not to be opened for 25-30 years. We're now in the heart of that drinking window.   Deep ruby with minimal bricking at the rim.  Nose is austere and slightly oxidized with strawberry, cherry, oak and wood notes.  This port is still tannic with a big body and lots of structure. Viscous, dense and beautifully integrated alcohol.  Rich flavours of strawberry and candied plum."
13600,80415,"Wow, just amazing vintage port! Perfectly aged and could go for more years obviously! My year as well so that much better!  Clear, deep ruby color. Clean, pronounced intensity aromas of eucalyptus, peppermint, Corinthian raisins, canned cherries and a hint of cinnamon. Sweet, medium acidity, high tannins and full body. Long finish. Very good!"
13601,80415,"Wow, you can’t beat the structure of this Dow. Fabulous now, but I think it has years of development ahead. Raspberries,  cherries and flowers on the nose. Not too sweet but layers of fruit and spice. "
13602,80415,"Red and dark fruit. Vanilla, wood. Very aromatic and sweet. Cherry and herbs.  Dark cherry, blackberry, blueberry, wood, licorice, pepper and a hint of vanilla. Very deep and brooding. Really well balanced and succulent yet plenty of tannin and freshness. This bodes well in 20-30 years. Very very delicious. 97"

13611,2179540,A light wine that is ideal to drink on a sunny afternoon with a fruity taste providing a pleasant mouth. Not a great wine but very good value and good enough for us to hold 18 bottles. Having finished a bottle over lunch and savouring the pleasant aftertaste we once opened another bottle taking the rest of the day to finish it. There are few wines that do this for us-it is that good!
13612,2179540,"Very nice white from Douro, which reminds me a bit of a white Graves. Very lovely mineral notes, fresh-cut grass, full body, notes of butter, medium to long finish."

13640,1840663,"This was a Costco purchase for under $10. This is a unique Portuguese varietal. It is heavier on the tannins. At the nose it smells strongly similar to a port or fine brandy. Yet, surprisingly it is not that sweet."
13641,1840663,Smooth with some fruit notes.
13642,1840663,"Good fruit, blackberries."

13650,1384439,"Excellent wine at this price point. On the fruity side so lovely with pasta or rice/chicken dishes. Comparable to another Portuguese budget star (Smart Dog, syrah/trincadeira)."
13651,1384439,"A popular wine on vivino and I understand why... QPR this is excellent! 🍇 Touriga Nacional and Syrah. 👁 Intense deep ruby. 👃A dark, first impression. A little      closed but okay.      Black cherry, blackberries, tar, dried      tobacco, dark chocolate and some      liquorice. 👅 Palate correct... for its price.       Black fruit, herbs, dried oak and       from mid palate       till finish tobacco, tar, leather and a       smoky accent. 🎓 My score: 3,5⭐"

13655,1384439,A lot of dark sweet berries like Jaboticaba fruits!
13656,1384439,Used this for my Al Ragu bolognese but also good to just drink. A firm wine with a good value👍 blend from Touriga Nacional and Syrah
13657,1384439,"Very rich and complex vine. On the begining  you can feel an apricot, later the smell is more sweet with notes of lilac and sweet grapes."
13658,1384439,red currants plum medium in weight
13659,1384439,"Raspberry bouquet, cherry and black currant taste. Medium body, long persistency."
13660,1384439,Light bodied and fruity although 14º. Good value
13661,1384439,Good value and easily as enjoyable as the white equivalent. 
13662,1384439,"Deep purple, long legs, medium to full body. Fruits of the forest, earth, mild spice and some leather scent.  Juicy, mild, dark fruit taste.  More Touriga Nacional than Syrah.  Pretty good table wine, but from this vineyard I would spend a few extra dollars for something else."

Dense but clean dark fruit, licorice driven aroma with hints of allspice, toast, chocolate.  Vivid acidity, nicely rounded tannins - smooth and silky, balanced on the palate. Has  a very soft peppery touch at finale.   3,5.  Found this one on local shelves. Honestly would like to taste 'Four C' series from this winery. "
13667,1639509,"Traditional Portuguese wine. Gift from a great friend. Amazing burgundy color, medium acidity, fruitful taste."
13668,1639509,Does the job required of it. Numbs the feelings connected to the inevitable existential misery of a Friday night.
13669,1639509,"Surprisingly oak-tasting and balanced for its price. This is also a blend, which seems to be Portugal's usual choice for wines."
13670,1639509,"Good smell. Red berries . Dark plum, vanilla, chocolate at the end. 3.8 "
13671,1639509,More fruit forward than I was expecting.   Only got a sip

Very young fruit forward nose of red berries and plums together with a menthol sharpness. On the palate fruity but well balanced with a fresh acidity and medium body. For that price you can't expect much more.
13678,1639509,"Interesting veriety, medium bodied, can't agree that the tannins are polished, somewhat on the sour and young side. But the tannins are definitely there and in spades. All in all nice wine, would go well with spicy food."
13679,1639509,"Meh, on second taste its better than ""meh"". Tastes ok next to the fire on a summer night that is cooling down."
13680,78241,"A pretty nice discovery at 12Euros combining Baga, Castelão, Trincadeira, Sousão,Bastardo, Alfrocheiro, Tinta Roriz 😊 a very elegant profile with seducing floral and red fruit notes "
13681,78241,This was another from that incredible and life changing trip. I just want a record of a few that I drank there. I lost most my photos but this one. 
13682,78241,"Ruby / violet color. Full-bodied, half dry, some fresh fruity ( red fruit / black fruit) and spicy but without excess. It`s a Bairrada that incorporates Baga variety. It has taste and olfactory sobriety. Without oak wood make-up, which makes it a rarity that tastes like wine, in this world of wines that don't taste like wine, but rather like oak, exotic yeast et al. I applaud alcohol at 12.5 ° because it is a moderate value that makes wine more friendly and therefore more gastronomic. Contains sulphites."
13683,78241,"Some plum, leather and minerals, which are combined with oak and some chocolate to make this Trincadeira and Baga blend a very elegant and almost fruity combination. However, it has enough acidity and minerals to make it a great balancing act. What a great value buy this is!"
13684,78241,A lot of white pepper and slate on the nose high acidity Cassis and tart cherry
13685,78241,"3.8 ~ 88% ($21.95) Campolargo 🇵🇹 Rol de Coisas Antigas 2016 Medium bodied, red n black fruity, smooth Bairrada variety blend ~ dryish intense, young 🍇 (3 gs/12.5% abv) with spices. Trying to appreciate these lower ABVs ~ this girl’s fresh and lively with nice tannins 😉"
13686,78241,"The name translated means ""bunch of old stuff"" & is made from a ""bunch"" of native Portuguese grapes.  Has developed gorgeous leathery notes with a touch of black fruit remaining.   Smooth as you like & eminently drinkable with no airs & graces about it!"
13687,78241,"Initially pleasing which diminished with each glass. Very tannic, light and with hints of plum fruits. Saúde!"
13688,78241,Nice nose with hints of oak and black fruit. Unfortunatelly very thin body and boring timid palete.
13689,78241,Nose of tart fruit.  Heavy blackberry on the front with distinct mineral finish. Well balanced and tasty. 
13690,78241,Total lack of finesse / does not call for another glass👎
13691,78241,"The label shows the historical blend for this Bairrada DOC which comprises Baga, Castelão Nacional, Bastardo, Tinta Pinheira (Rufete), Souzão, Alfrocheiro & Trincadeira, aged 12m in used 300L French oak.  Pale ruby. Pronounced aroma intensity, earthy & slightly funky w. raspberry, black cherry, loganberry & microx notes of liquorice, anise & creamy mulberry. Developing.  Dry. Fruity & ripe w. dried cranberry, redcurrant, raspberry & black cherry. High tannins, med alc, m+ acid & a grippy m+ finish. Tasty."
13692,78241,"Dry, well balanced with medium body and long aftertaste. Fresh minerals, and still tones of sandalwood, tobacco and a small hints of mint."
13693,78241,"-Cellar clean up  Complexo, to say the least. Given the polygraph, juro que seria Pinot Noir. E Bourgogne. Turmix Bairrada, delicado, cuidado e sem stress revela uma impressionante prova em registo state of the art.  Pede copo largo e ainda assim grita veludo. Folhas secas e terra. O delicado frutado só acrescenta valor, sem ser intrusivo, brilha em todo o seu caudal. Elegante. Mas, de facto, hiper-discreto.  Não é Pinot Noir. E qual é o problema? "
13694,78241,Love it. Pure wood!!
13695,45454,"A beautiful vintage port, with spicy character, beautiful intensity, and great freshness - it starts to reveal much - a top quality port that will delight winelovers "
13696,45454,"Arrrrrrooooo!  Thanks to the Port Hound Pack Alpha Dog Leader Scott White for this gem during our meet-up last weekend!  Finishing up the last filtered dregs tonight, this is baby smooth.  No formal notes as the company of Scott and GS made for a perfect score when opened 5 nights ago.  Arrrrrooooo!"
13697,45454,Have tasted this many times. Was very approachable upon release then went to sleep for about 10 years. Still young? If you have a chance try it!
13698,45454,"4.3 Blackcurrant jam, currants, blueberry, sweet spice. Feels a bit rocky, not quite integrated. Smooth with ripe, sweet fruits, high alc, surprising acidity. "

13700,45454,"Yum who doesn't love a port.   It's like a dark fruit chocolate box of tricks, but the layer seperator carries the invisible thing that is the tour de force.    Big dried grape coffee elixir.  "
13701,45454,Fabulous fruit. Sweet and feminine like most Graham's. Still very young. Can use more time in the bottle. Sort of like a teenager port that still needs to mature some more.
13702,45454,"Caramel and chocolate with hints of Asian spices, tea and plums. The palette is quite silky with young fruit, and the wine would benefit from more time in the bottle. May be even better after 2024."
13703,45454,"  1/11/19 Not sure I will buy again. Too sweet for Rita. I am beginning to like Tawney Port more; nuttier and dryer. Looking at 20 and 30 yr: Still have about half left. May wait for Stephen and Irene to finish w me 1/2/19 375 ml/ half bottle. About as good as it gets. One of the best vintage ports I have had. Rich, soft smooth; dark fruit; prunes. Great with cheese; nuts , cheesecake. Reminds me of the 1985 vintage."
13704,45454,"4.3 1994 was called the best vintage since 1927 with a textbook weather pattern and bottles that should not to be opened for 25-30 years. We're now in the heart of that drinking window.   Medium ruby with minimal bricking.  Very traditional on the nose with notes of prune, fig, raisin and chocolate. Atypical but strong clove note as well.  This is a softer, lighter style of port. Remarkably smooth with perfect alcohol integration. Maybe too sweet?  Flavours of butterscotch, prune, fig  Long finish"
13705,45454,"Velvety Gorgeousness! Spicy berry compote (thanks for that descriptor Scott) stewed over ripe plums, anise, chocolate and so much more. Thanks Scott White for bringing this all the way from Minneapolis to our Vivino party in Seattle last weekend.  "
13706,45454,"Vivino tasting at my home  How to finish such a great tasting? Psy knows it absolutely and offered us this fabulous Port!   Oh my dear, what a great essence with this awesome nutty nose.

Really a memorable evening for Karin and me, thanks for joining us dear friends!!!!!!! "
13707,45454,"Tawny in color. Sweet almond, dried apricot, butterscotch, honey and a touch of oxidation. Full body, medium+ acidity. Wonderful balance.  This has aged perfectly.  Served with cherry preserves, blue cheese and candied pecans. Quite a treat half way through the evening last night! "
13708,45454,"Spectacular fruit of red currant, cherry and jammy raspberry, with overtones of anise and menthol. So much going on.  On the palate it is perfectly structured with good acidity and soft tannins. A rare port indeed!"
13709,45454,"Decadent and light port, amazing given that it’s only twenty five years old. Light aromas of blackberries and black plums.  Similar flavors with some chocolate, oak, raisin, potpourri , fig and cedar.  Seems very young overall; and has plenty of life left.  "
13710,76440,"90/100 Blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira, Castelão, and Alicante Bouschet. Aged 12 months in oak and 12 in bottle, foot trodden. This is refined and well put together. Notes of black cherry, violets, red plum, greens, and a touch of cedar. Full, elegant, and peppery on the palate. Grippy tannins. Made from foot trodden grapes. "
13711,76440,Explodey Portuguese loveliness. Because I know this is foot trodden I am hoping for a toenail in it! Ewwwwww! But seriously folks it a big and lush oaky monster. Love it

13729,2603304,"ES88 AD92. Blend Moreto, Tinta Grossa, Trincadeira & Aragonês grapes 🍇 from Alentejo, Portugal 🇵🇹. Fermented in amphorae, no oak. Ancient technique. 12% alcohol. Middle body"
13730,2603304,Different flavors resulting from the amphora 🏺 method. 
13731,2603304,"A fruity wine, a little “green”, a great floral bouquet, with an ever so slight hint of earth. Soft tannins."
13732,2603304,Medium bodied with red fruit flavors. Like the freshness but it’s a bit simplistic. 
13733,2603304,Undistinguished nose. Earth and mineral on the tongue. Medium bodied. Leather notes on the finish.
13734,2603304,AMazing traditional clay matured wine
13735,2603304,"Fruit forward on the nose. Low tannin - softer on the palate. Dark fruits on the touch. It's enjoyable, but not a wine that fits my favorite profile - medium across."
13736,2603304,First natural wine and I loved it. 
13737,2603304,"90+/100 Blend of Moreto, Trincadeira, Tinta Grossa, and Aragonez. Notes of sour cherry, green herbs, pepper, and burnt meat. This is wild and juicy with firm tannins. Distinctive and unique. Very delicious. Made in amphora with no temperature control and indigenous yeasts. "
13738,2603304,Overall very nice wine. Don't think it's all bold as reviewed but really well balanced. Soft like a velvet almost. 
13739,2603304,Good for mom   No sulfates 
13740,1811412,Robust & understated like our 1st woman President. 
13741,1811412,"Opening red for the tasting with Nik and Mathias, and my contribution. Strong nose of oak- usually this precedes a wine I don't love. But in this case, the very present oak was softened by deep plum and jammy dark fruits. I wouldn't drink it alone, but as a great compliment to a protein rich meal. I had the pleasure of meeting one of the family members while on vacation in Sintra, Portugal. A nice representative for the terroir. "
13742,1811412,"The first red that Beth, Mathias & I had during our great evening on Friday, a 100% Touriga Nacional with heavy oaking.  12.5% abv, dark purple red, oily slow tears, inky.  Intense nose with heavy oak aromas, herbal twist, underbush, a whiff of dark berries.  The palate is a mirror of the nose, heavy oak & herbal flavours, not much fruit, dry & astringent tannins, med acidity, rough.  A bit too much on the oaky side for me, lacks a bit balance & fruit, full body, long finish.  Too young but okay 83-84p"
13743,1811412,Medium bodied on the sweeter side 
13744,1811412,"86/100  Medium ruby, purple hue.  On the nose is complex and fine with spirit soaked cherry, earth and some funky notes of fermentation.  In the mouth is playful with a slight fizz on the tongue, nice round coarse tannins, high acidity and medium bodied, opens with red berries, then some herbaceous notes and a mineral background; medium finish."
13745,1811412,Mild and very tasty 
13746,1811412,Delightful! Not much to speak of on the nose but immediately backed up by punchy cherries and sherbet.
13747,1811412,"When I drink old world wine, this is exactly what I want - terroir. Opens with subtle notes of tart black fruit like blackberry and black plum. Overtaken on the nose with herbal spices of tarragon, dill, oregano, and basil. Very green. Palate was similar with fruit flavors quickly masked by gravel, turned earth, tobacco leaf, and some green bell pepper. Layered flavors were harmonious. I wish it would of had more fruit, but I loved this wine. Smooth tannins and a lingering finish. "
13748,1811412,"Sumptuous rich tannic and (my favorite descriptor) old world spices.  This is thick with the aroma of leather, with a basil-ish/eucalyptus-ish back notes. Yes, there’s cherry too on the palate but it’s it’s far far from the CA Cab version of cherry.   "

13750,1811412,"A fruit forward red from Portugal featuring the Toriga Nacional grape. Notes of chocolate and leather round out the tannins in this bold, somewhat dry red. Well balanced and a pleasure to drink. "
13751,1811412,"A nice and reasonably priced Portuguese red blend featuring touriga nacional, a grape I really like. Fruit flavor is strong—it leads with red and purple berries—, but chocolate tannic notes help keep it in perspective and add complexity. Good with strongly flavored food."
13752,1811412,"Quite jammy. Stewed raspberry, little blackberry. Chalky Tannin, but it smoothes out as it breathes in a glass. A little bit of funk on the nose, which is quite pleasant. "
13753,1811412,Really nice! Had this in SF at essi
13754,1811412,Nice and minerals with a soft finish 
13755,2376360,Agree with Wine Folly in Touriga National offering -- at least in this Alentejano case -- profound depth of flavour at an obscenely good value!
13756,2376360, We really enjoyed this wine. The wine makers notes are spot on although we would add notes of damson on the palate. 
13757,2376360,"Classic style wine from the Alentejo region. Fruity, slightly young, but lively and a joy to drink. "
13758,2376360,"Surprisingly better than last vintages. Dark fruit,   cherry, vanilla and oak. Complex notes, yet so balanced. Very good."

13782,2376360,"Since the opening of the bottle, such nice aromas, violet and strawberry, with raspberry, blackberry and bell pepper. Still with ageing potencial, strong oak and vanilla with a delicious caramel chocolate aftertaste. Smooth tannins and low acidity, so complex and so nice, 4.1"
13783,2376360,"Ruby-red color in the glass. Ripe strawberry, citrus fruits, balsamic nuances, blackberry, oak, cherry and hints of caraway in the nose accompanied by earthy nuances, forest floor and iron on the tongue. Rather low body, very fresh and fruity acidity and medium minus tannins. Overall, a beautiful Alentejano Red. Very good complexity, well-balanced, could maybe use a bit more body and saturated acidity; one of those Reds that leans a bit toward the experience of a White. Very enjoyable. (3.8)"

13785,1291873,Highly recommended this Douro field blend from a premium winemaker. Soft textures with layers of ripe forrest fruit flavours. The highlight for many of us panelists of the fine series of Portugese reds. A bargain price given quality - bordeaux lovers who like warm years will appreciate this as well. A blend of 26 (!) grape varietals must be a hell of a ride for the cellar master to compose this.!
13786,1291873,"Now this is something. A field blend of some 25 grapes. Yes....  And it is grand!  2011 was a stellar vintage in Portugal and this wine is exemplary for it; rich nose, many impressions, friendly.   Excellent balance, med acidity and tannins. Mild spicy, lovely tones of licorice and many more. 14,5% fully integrated abv. A delight on the tongue 👅 . Top wine. 18 pts. "
13787,1291873,"Rich, profund, elegant, fruity, spicy: the prototype of a perfect Douro from Top-producer Crasto. Every gulp pure joy, worth each cent! Great!"
13788,1291873,"One of my favorites, a great wine with plenty of character simple and clean. Nice tannic structure, dark stone fruit but nuanced, smoke and tannins, cool and refreshing."
13789,1291873,"Great deep red color. Best scent ever, full pallete even in first taste.  Light wood with heavy red fruit. Well balanced and med tannine. Long aftertaste. Great wine true to its vinha velha name."
13790,1291873,"Wonderful, with blackberries, plums, blueberries, vanilla, olives, licorice and coccoa. Full vodied with fine tannins and a great balance. A lingering tobacco aftertaste coats your palate."
13791,1291873,"We get excited just pouring this wine. It is just wonderful to see the burgundy waves form on the glass. On the nose we get brute notes of bitter almonds. This is thick and it leaves little to the imagination. These almonds are complemented by raisins, cinnamon and touches of Muscat. On the tongue it is complex with early hints of red berries. Long lasting and taken cover with tangerines.  A really wonderful wine!"
13792,1291873,"I was unexpectedly swept off my feet by this Portuguese blend ! Has a lively deep cherry red color. It's nose is elegant and well balanced; balckberry & blueberry fruit intermingle with mixed spices and hints of dark cherry licorice and oak. Entry in palate is smooth and silky. Medium bodied, galant and perfectly structured. Mid palate holds a thin line central acidity that helps it's fine grained tannins to create a long and distinguished consistent finish. Excellent !! Highly recommended !!"
13793,1291873,"Very dark and intense blood red colour. Aromas of ink and plum. As with most reservas, strong vanilla woody flavours ever present and lots of blackberries in the background. High alcohol content of 14.5%. A strong and powerful wine, still young to be enjoyed fully now."
13794,1291873,"The 2011 is herald as one of the best years in recent memory - maybe even a mythical year. So slightly biased I can say this is the best that QdCrasto have produced. Having tried every cuvée they done and most years, this is perfectly balanced. One bottle drunk with a four month interval with argon gas ( look back to the first analysis ) Dreamy Tannins, integrated acidity and alcohol enhancing the late July fruit - not dark but just plum right. Medium mouth fill, enhancing the sense of a very current wine. "
13795,1291873,"Mmm, complex on the nose, some fruity and spicy aromas, oak is well integrated, balanced as it must be with firm but not intrusive tannins.Deep and long finish.I'm glad that I've tried this gem.Great wine."
13796,1291873,"Wonderful wine.  The color is deep red, brilliant, intense.  The nose is fruity, mainly blackberry and cherry.  You also find black chocolate and coffee.  It makes the palate an explosion of pleasure with a delicate and mellow taste, fullfilling the mouth with a unique flavor. The great acidity and marvelous tannins end with a long persistence."
13797,1291873,"Quinta do Crasto Reserva Old Vines shows a complex aroma, with the fruit and the oak very well integrated and revealing spicy nuances. Intense and deep on the palate. The firm tannic structure gives great balance to the wine, with a long and lingering finish."
13798,1291873,"The absolute star of the show! What a wonderful bottle and one of my absolute favourites. It is a field blend of more than 20 different varieties of grapes (and you can taste them all...).   On the nose: hints of red fruit, earth, autumn leafs, tar, leather, plum, blackberry, and oak and vanilla. On the palate: gentle, smooth as silk, yet refined, layered, complex and interesting.   What a wonderful little bottle!  Cheers! @own cellar"
13799,1291873,"Deep ruby red color with bold and seductive hints of vanilla with black fruit and red fruit jam aromas. Hints of hay, wet stone, aged red meat, cloves, cigar box, cedar, smoke and leather. Full bodied, balanced tannins with good acidity and nice, velvety long finish. Great Wine !!!"
13800,1291873,"94/100 This has developed well. Notes of tomato leaf, tobacco leaf, cherry, dried raspberry, and cherry. Full and rich with developed tannins and a slight savory note. Long finish. Fantasti value for money in terms of fine wine. "
13801,1291873,"THE ROMANCE OF PORTUGAL  A domineering shadow of 2009 over this difficult vintage, true skill shines here. Not as sexy but still elegant, Crasto's 70 yr old vines provide backbone for the vintner to build on with this royal garnet juice.  Raspberry, forest floor & jasmine spice hit the nose but the caressing texture gives me a WOW! Rounded edges but the flavors sneak through like a razor Samurai edge! Plum cherries & fine grained tannins woven like a tapestry show good structure with a full minute finish."
13802,1291873,What a great wine...very well structured.  On the nouse very sweet and smouke barrel. On mouth rhe strong taste of old vines.
13803,1291873,"Well, who needs French wine with this type of red available  from Portugal !!!. Tried a normal Quinta Do Crasto a while agoI. But this Reserve is streets ahead."
13804,1291873,"Velvety goodness, putting up my Portuguese flag tonight... Took me a while ... (Sorry Ronaldo) very appealing wine to me... Duro needs more investigation from me!"
13805,1291873,Incredible wine...after 10 years you can really feel the leather and the oak in the nose. Very balanced with a very nice and long aftertast. Had it with very good friends and enjoyed every sip!!
13806,1291873,Douro field blend of 70+ years old vines - aged 16 months in french and american oak. Complex chocolaty and velvery plavpurs with some spice tones - nice combo to the truffle salami. @Onno Misset.
13807,1291873,"My contribution, selected from the wish list of Dries.
  For several years I’m keeping 2 boxes of these beauties in my cellar. So I was very curious to uncork the first bottle.
 Speaking about vivid fruit aromas and sublime wood integration!
 A little drop of Balsamic cream, blackberries, black cherries, mocha and a bitter touch of pure chocolate.
 On the palate you have a layered expression with a recurrence of most aromas from the nose, combined with a perfect balance of tannins and acidity.  🔽🔽🔽comments🔽🔽🔽"
13808,1291873,"[Vivino Leuven 9/11] @[1|17441025|Koen Danhieux] ▶️ @[1|411157|Dries Thirion] I’m starting to like blind tasting, even if I’m not particularly talented. I like it because it confirms why certain wines made me the wine fan I am. Crasto ‘s Reserva is one of them and this mature one knocked it out of the park!! Meaty nose with cinnamon, coffee, perfect oak, blackberry, black currant and smoke followed by a palate with perfect acidity/tannines balance, plenty black fruit and plum. What a finish also!! 4.6"
13809,1291873,"This classic Douro Crasto vinhas velhas or reserva is a great Douro red, very consistent and regular year after year.  From a vineyard as age as 70-100 years and a very low production, hand picked grapes and maleolatic fermentation in new french oak barrels for 18 months emerges this complex red.  Great logevity marks this beutifull fullbodied wine made with tipical portuguese grapes of Douro.  Gold/Silver WS 94 Vivino 4,2  Excellent!!!"
13810,1291873,"Wishlisted #9  A wine from my list wisely selected by @Koen Danhieux from  his 2 cases. The time was about right now to start drinking these top bottles. The best field blend I know!   Bordeaux red in colour, nicely looking with a well defined nose of black fruits, caramel, coffee, complexity. The taste starts with a velvet mouthfeel, a lot of power, a lot black fruits, perfect wood, a tad of mint and very refined. Koen will have a lot pleasure with his other 11bottles. Thanks to share this one.  Rate 4,4⭐️"
13811,1291873,"Intense aromas of blackberry, black cherry, blueberry, black currant prunes and violet. Balanced, complex, deep texture and elegant structure. Powerful tannins, well integrated in full body with cigar box, fine chocolate and coffee luxurious aromas. Very long finish "
13812,1291873,"This is in such a good place right now. Much evolved from trying it 3 years ago when it was uneven. Depth and quality of dark old vine fruit shines through. Polished and rather elegant in its structure/tannins with well judged oak that has married the fruit very well. Didn’t decant and drank rather quickly, certainly worth giving it some air to see what complexity of flavour lies underneath. Beautiful texture, balance and finish"
13813,1291873,"It’s been one year since I last tasted this wonderful Douro. It seems even better. Lots of matured fruits, flowers, vanilla and spices (black tea and sandalwood). On the palate is dense, a fine texture tannins, balanced. It keeps on the aftertaste the fruits, vanilla, flowers and some tobacco for a long, long time.   Este grande Douro melhora a cada ano que passa. Aromas de frutas maduras, violetas, baunilha e especiarias (chá preto e sândalo). Corpo médio cheio, mas denso, taninos muito finos e equilibra"
13814,1291873,"Fantastic Douro!!! Perfectly in tune from nose to mouth. Full of ripe berries and plums, with vivid hints of spices and Port wine in the aftertaste. Great tannin profile, despite the prominent residual sugar all around."
13815,1598206,Good quality for a good wine. Need to try it again (not after few other wines).
13816,1598206,"Big tasting day lined up today.   Starting at Wines of Portugal 🇵🇹 store in Lisbon.   Pale yellow, apples and peaches on the nose.   Very mouthful, a deep tasting, citrus up front fading into a slight bitterness at the end. Really long finish. "
13817,1598206,"Decent white blend  👃 honeysuckle, white peach, floral, white blossom, lemon 👄 citrus, tart bitter finish, but heat on end  Decent quaffer, downgraded due to alcohol heat on end, good but not awesome "

13822,1911775,"Deep purple color with vanilla, black cherry, blueberry, oak, and tobacco on the nose. The palate follows the nose with a long aftertaste of vanilla and oak. For some it may be a bit too hot, but overall it is  a great wine! 4.4"

13827,1911775,"blackberry oak  Having tried this one against previous year vintage, I believe I drunk it too soon. My advice would be to wait a bit. There already some hits of aging, but taking the older wine experience waiting for one year will make a great difference!"
13828,1911775,"Love this! Taster at winery, a big wine, quite earthy, truffles, dark fruit. Medium- acidity, good complexity. Will only get better. Got 2 bottles: the 2015 and 2026. Let's see...."
13829,1911775,"Deep and dense purple color with black and violet reflexes. The bouquet is still dense and concentrated with blackberry, black cherry and sloe. Some ethereal and spicy notes. The palate shows a lot of force but is still elegant. Has a lot of freshness to it. Full body, long finish. It is already very good but will need some time to settle. Will age well for decades."

Flavors of cherry and a bit of pomegranate (or tart strawberry), leather/oak, slight black pepper spiciness. Fine with dinner (mushroom pizza tonight) and reasonably priced @ 7.99 USD, but not otherwise memorable."

It is strong, robust, and balanced with harmony between a potent tannin structure and an equal acid level. This is a fortified sweet wine that holds up by itself, or pair it with luxurious dark chocolate. The nose welcomes blackberry, cooked plum, fig, stewed strawberry, walnut, and dark chocolate that the palate will also confirm."

13915,22323,"Another stellar white from Portugal 🇵🇹, this time from the master Luis Pato. High acidity , med body, and quite complex. A lot of stone fruit (apple , melon , pear), and a lot of minerals - with some citrus (  orange lemon) herbaceous  and spicy (thyme, sage). Stone , slate , salt 🧂 and more. Shall develop and improve over the next few years."
13916,22323,"This is a pretty full bodied white with a lot of peach and orange. Particularly well balanced, pairs nicely with squid or more meaty seafood. Despite the boldness, it's surprisingly light and refreshing too. "

13926,22323,"4.5⭐️ for this Portuguese 🇵🇹 white wine. 👁 Clear visual with a pale straw color.👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry and fresh with citrine fruits and a second sniff focused on lemon, mineral and white fruits. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of citrine fruits. Good persistence in the mouth with medium finish. Elegance white wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🥂"
13927,1434566,"If I had to choose my surprise wine of the year, this Douro would be it. It’s full bodied and darker than any Douro I’ve had in the past. Its long tannins deliver exquisite flavours,  with oak, vanilla, blackberry, plum and cherry dancing mightily on your palate. Highly recommend it."

13929,1434566,9/2/21 Churchill’s Estate wine tasting - Catherine liked it way more than Alex - Catherine got jam and fruit forward taste with no bite. Alex got more bite and thick with sharp jam and red fruit

13937,1434566,"Charming yet serious Douro red.   Warm nose; ripe fruit (a little jammy maybe) and earthy tones. On the palate, smoke, pepper, spicy alongside the fruit tones. All balanced and nicely lingering finish. Very good. 15 pts "
13938,1434566,"3.8/5 ⭐️ bumped up for supreme value!  This vintage is earlier drinking due to dry year with ample heat.   Nose is smoke, cooked fruit , and earth. Palate is smoke, pepper, spice, earth, hint of tar over rich blackberry, plums and black raspberry.  Unreal value! "
13939,1434566,Dry wood and some kind of parfumerie in nose Inky. Substantial acidity. Rowanberry in aftertaste. Overall reminded Argentinean Malbec. 3.8*

13941,1434566,"A beautifully full Portuguese red, with well blended top notes of oak, vanilla, plum, tobacco, and raspberry, which make for a moderately dry wine which is good value for money.

13945,1400144,Another pearl from Douro...in this case Douro Superior a marvellous blend of Touriga Nacional and Franca with Tinta Roriz.

13950,1400144,Tasted at Davy’s Old World Portfolio Tasting.
13951,1400144,"Interesting wine and the first time that I have had it. Generally easy drinking, however nothing spectacular to it. Usually red fruits, light finish and light tannins. A good table wine, however, lacking that complexity to warrant it to be a very good wine."
13952,1400144,Troubling! It’s won a silver at prestigious wine awards and has a good rating on here  But I know Portuguese wine and I know Douro wines This is a good wine.  But it’s watery and light and not what I expected 
13953,1400144,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit). Ruby / violet color, full-bodied, medium-dry. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Douro region. Contains sulfites. 14.° alcoholics.   "
13954,1400144,"Still a great Douro wine. Very good price-quality relation. Good tannins, red fruit with cherry qnd raspberry notes. Also a little of tobacco in a full body Douro red. 2011 and still little notes of oak, from the 18 months in French oak barrels of this great blend."
13955,1400144,"Great value, fruity start with oaky aftertaste.."
13956,1400144,Medium tannins. Leather and cherry notes. Quite full bodied and complex 
13957,1434566,"Beautifull violet colour. Nose of red fruits as blackberries, raspberries and sherries, overwhelmed with coffee and subtile herbs. In mouth showed medium body, though with persistant and long flavours, well balanced tanins and lovely fruity aftertaste. Harmonized perfectly well with my wife's codfish prepared Ze do Pipo's style. Wonderfull Eastern lunch!"
13958,1434566,Hint of molasses chalk and cherries on the nose. Inky dark colour. Dark Chocolate and mild tobacco on palate. Medium tannins. Will age nicely.

13960,1434566,"Scents of cherry raspberry, cherry with strong tobacco, green and white pepper. Taste is red fruit with leather and a strong peppery and astringent finish. Good with blue cheese hamburgers."
13961,1434566,"Portugal, one of my first wines from the Duoro valley.  Appearance: clear, deep, ruby some legs. Nose: clean, medium intensity, vegetable, sweet spice, cherry, cooked plums. Still developing. Palate: dry, medium - acidity, medium tannins, alcohol medium, body medium  flavour intensity medium as well. Aromas like cherries, cooked fruits and stone fruits. Conclusion: a medium finish and well balanced, very good quality for value. Can drink now, but has potential for ageing."
13962,1434566,"Really interesting wine , nose changed as it opens up,  stone and flowers to begin with,  then all the earth and mushrooms about an hour later , chocolate cherries,  plum and black fruit with cassis, next time I will decant for at least 3 hours before tasting."
13963,1434566,"Good surprise, round , all in balance , tasty. One does not want to stop drinking. It is not outstanding but no one is going to be disappointed. Expensive in Brasil, with the Black Friday discount window, it got its price aligned Abroad is a good cost / benefit relationship"
13964,1434566,Well balanced medium body red.  Black cherry.  Blackberry.  Herbal notes.   Lively acidity.  Finishes with red licorice note.
13965,1434566,"Balanced, fruity, medium volume and no structure."
13966,1434566,Intense. Long finish. Very good.

13987,1130406,"Blackberries, blueberries, cherries, and oak but it’s bold and dry. This is a powerful red wine I’ve enjoyed with chicken but it’s good enough to buy again and again at the price I pay in Portugal. "
13988,1130406,"Satisfying wine considering price/quality ratio. You drink it and there is something to taste. BlackBerry and chocolate hints, nice thick texture. And screw cap what is a bit surprising as the wine is from Portugal."

13990,1130406,I like I. It's not entirely as bold as I like but it's very flavourful. It doesn't have very long legs but it's up for a good time. Its a very pleasant sipping wine: actually very easy to sip glass after glass.

14013,1706208,"Actually a 3,8 to this Alentejano, crafted by grapes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Aragonês and Alicante Bouschet, aged for 12 months in French and American oak barrels, had a dark ruby in color, bringing aromas of very ripe black fruits in the form of jam, coffee and  certain minerality with wood  being discreetly present. From medium to full body, the tannins are tame but still angry which makes it have a long and persistent finish. Still young. Better wait at least five years to taste it."

14179,1703619,"Very dark wine with no signs of maturation. Fruitiness, berries and cedar wood on the nose. The wine is well balanced with a good acidity. The fruitiness is carried over on the aftertaste. "
14180,1703619,Medium ruby red with some agrin; shy fruity herb spice manure? ; fruity attack tobacco some ‘green’ berries to lingering clean finish;; should last a year or three

14193,1558417,"In a deep red he flows into the glass and smells intensively of ripe wild berries and fresh herbs. On the palate, it presents itself juicy with nuances of dark chocolate and dense tannins. It leaves a soft and spicy impression of perfect balance."
14194,1558417,"Autumn is starting, so good to taste the summer of Portugal. Full body, oak,black fruit, raisin and some tones of red fresh fruit"
14195,1558417,"4.2 - still quite fresh, nice potential (with time it opens up)"

14199,1203558,"Quite enjoyable white wine, lemon, lime, stone, pineapple, green apple and some hint of pear and mango. The touch of carbonation makes this an excellent thirst quenching wine. Paired with Hot Sushi. "
14200,1203558,"3.9 enjoyable loureiro.  light straw coloured, slight effervescence.  Medium citrus  nose.  Light bodied and dry with zippy acidity and done salinity in the mouth.  Good value for under €5"
14201,1203558,"Delicious and refreshing vinho verde. Stone, pear, citrus, saline minerals. Crisp with a little prickling fizz on the tongue. Dry, light and high acidity. Acidic finish with Lemon/lime candy and white pepper. Not the most complex wine but serves its purpose very well in the sun ice cold. Did I mention it is also a good qpr bottle? 3,8 "
14202,1203558,"Medium lemon colour. Dry with high acidity. Aromas of blossom, acacia, green apples and lemon. Light bodied. Loving this!"
14203,1203558,"Just what you'd expect, a fizzle on the palate with green fruit. Haven't had one in a while, but this was just how I remembered vinho verde to be!"
14204,1203558,It’s got a citrus zest and is fairly dry. A wine to take you back to a sunny summer day….

14211,1203558,Ok...for the price....
14212,76372,"Yes. Finally Friday!!!  And it’s time to some nice Port. I had the pleasure to taste the 1941 the other day , and the 1952 is just as good. Bottled in 2019 so as fresh that it can be. Almost 70 years old. Amazing. As @[1|2317376|Ricardo Kuplich] would say. “Excellent “. 👍👍💪💪🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷"
14213,76372,"Words cannot even describe! Absolutely magnificent port! Gets warmer as you sip with Sweet with honey, dates, toffee, maple syrup, fig, toasted almond, and pecan...try it over ice cream with sautéed bananas or pecan pie!"
14214,76372,Prunes and leather
14215,76372,"Very enjoyable 21 year old to close out the evening of NMTB. Smooth with a hint of raisin, but not omnipresent like some one dimensional offerings😊"
14216,76372,If I could give this 6 stars I would. Words are inadequate to describe the complexity of flavours along with the perfect balance and acidity. Amazing.
14217,76372,"Walnuts and toasted figs. Roasted fig, liquid walnuts, distilled sunshine. A magnificent port from the oldest port house in the world. Barrel aged 50 years in oak.  "
14218,76372,"17.5/20. Caramel, walnut jam, toffee, tea, oak, light spices. Good acidity, still fresh on the palate. Fantastic!"
14219,76372,An old tawny with a wonderful acidity that makes this Kopke port once more a delicious and very attractive port - complex and with a very fine structure - an intense and beautiful wine 😊
14220,76372,17/20: initially even more impressive than the 66 in terms of smoothness and texture but is does fade a bit in the glass but still very youthfull and fresh for its 60th birthday.
14221,76372,Had at Emmer and Rye. Very nutty. Super good 
14222,76372,Amazing bottle. Last dinner before fado closed 
14223,76372,"PORT TASTING COLLECTION 12/12  Kopke specializes in Colheita which means ""harvest"" and is actually a tawny from a single vintage. 7 yrs minimum barrel aging, this is 35 years and is impressive!!  I was mesmerised by the rosy amber color tumbling into the glass! Supremely perfumed, the nose engulfed me in dry florals, lavender, cinnamon & pronounced nuttiness! The palate had rum, cumin, dry fruits, tangerine & wood spice. Massive depth & concentration. Tawny angels from heaven!  95 pts"
14224,76372,"The best vintage Port I have tasted. Dark amber hue. Perfect balance of sweetness and acidity. Smooth and lush. Dried figs, toasted nuts. Candy walnut finish goes on and on. This Port will put 90% of vintage Port into shame. Wow!"
14225,76372,"Arrrrrrroooooooooo!  After a long hiatus, we are back in Oregon Wine country, kicking off our tasting spree at Valley Wine Merchants in Newberg, OR.  Among many good Pinot Noirs in the shop, they also have gems like these.  Just heavenly caramel, nuts, dried fruits and a finish like the Energizer Bunny.  This Port Hound is back on the trail this week to sniff out some good Oregon wines!  Arrrrrrrrooooooo! "
14226,76372,"Great Colheita from 1985, bottled in 2014.  Nose is intense with nuts and orange peel. Palate has apricot, brown sugar, orange, hazelnuts. Great depth and an immensely long finish.👍👌🔝🔝🔝  Candy for adults 😉"
14227,2850316,Nice.  Fruity and full body.  To sweet.
14228,2850316,An excellent Vintage Port. Great bouquet reminiscent to me of violets. Complex structure with a slightly chocolate finish that could possibly come out even more with additional aging. Tannins are nicely balanced. Enjoy. 
14229,2850316, blueberry mint apple
14230,2850316,"Blueberry, honey, molasses, caramel, 19.5%, exceptional value for $31. 4.1."
14231,2850316,Mix with tonic water. Mint leaf. Good and light.
14232,2850316,Very rich. Pairs well with chocolate and blueberries. 
14233,2850316,The best out there
14234,8971,"👁 garnet red with orange reflections 👃 A wonderfully delicate aroma of dried fruits and a touch of crystallized tangerine peel and slight nutty character.  👄On the palate, very elegant with an all envolving silky texture with fruit coming through and leading to a soft finish.  Excellent wine!  "
14235,8971,Not my cup of tea
14236,8971,"No wonders, my vintage so a good one - a wine with great freshness, nice and opulent oak touch, intense acidity delicious toffee caramel hints"
14237,8971,"sweet, smoth, soft after good meat"
14238,8971,A lighter dry (ish) tawny port. Nice with dessert.
14239,8971, Raisiny. Not very sweet. Dried fruit and nuts. Alcoholic. Wood and vanilla. Went great with dulce de leche bread pudding. Dark caramel color. 
14240,8971,"Beautiful, deep glowing amber. Figs, orange peel, hazelnuts, almonds, butter, old wooden floors... Concentrated, graceful and long. Lovely!"
14241,8971,"Caramel, toasted honey, white chocolate, almond, walnut, pistacho, toffee, pungent on the nose. Well balanced alcohol upholding the natural sweetness of the wine. This is balanced with a coffee bitterness of the long and juicy finish. "
14242,8971,"93/100 Wonderful Tawny Port. Notes of honey, toffee, coffee, dried apricot, and almonds. Full and silky in bodied with high acidity and a long creamy finish. Great value for money as far as Ports go."
14243,8971,Amazing.  raisin toffee caramel honey oak. 
14244,8971,"Excellent - blackcurrant, chocolate and leather - not too sweet"
14245,8971,"Trivia: does anyone knows the difference between tawny, ruby, colheita, garrafeira, vintage, crusted, single quinta, lbv? And your favorite?  Great dinner in Alabaster restaurant in Madrid, from Galicia, finished with a colheita Porto.  Brownish tawny color, mid intensity. Nose is very nutty with aromas of dry fruit like figs.Sweet and mineral attack, fullbody sensantion,pleasant and frank palate that stays for long time. Great dinner and great Porto:)"
14246,8971,"Gorgeous Colheita port from Niepoort, one of Portugal's most impressive producers. Pale, bright and tawny, with the green rim of long barrel ageing. Nose of dried fruit, old wood and spice. The palate starts soft and sweet, with a tangy, spicy finish. Decadent, bold and complex. Raisin, date, dried cherry, citrus peel, cinnamon and nutmeg, walnut and brown sugar. The big flavours carry the alcohol well and it has a lovely combination of intensity and balance. Very moreish, too good for a Wednesday evening!"
14247,8971,"(1980 Colheita)  Upfront forward nose. Elegant smell of raisin, figs and nuts. Velvet Soft mouthfeel. Sweet Vanilla flavours and apricot/fig/date  and a mouthwatering sensation. Astonishing lively at the age of 35 years. Lovely balanced. (was lucky to find at a restaurant serving it at 5 EUR by the glass.) Mega bargin.... Great Long after taste."
14248,8971,"In my opinion Niepoort makes some of the best ports, that maintain to be incredibly fruit forward, even at astonishing old ages.  This is just another great example of this. Tasted up against 1968, and it was hard to say which one was better. This had a more vinous feel to it, with notes of blackberry crumble, cigar box, chewy dark chocolate, salt caramel, cassis, black cherries and fruitcake. Needles to say both were fantastic. "
14249,1272205,"Outstanding Douro Grande Reserva. Deep ruby red in color. Intense notes of dark fruit, with vanilla, leather and toasted oak on the nose. Powerful, balanced acidity, ripe tannins, fruit and minerals in the mouth, with long spicy finish. "
14250,1272205,"Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: This blend of old vines (75%) and Tinta Roriz (25%) was our favorite. Deep dark red in the glass, it is a powerful, ripe and fruity wine which is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. It‘s really good now, but it has more ageing potential. (4.3 points)"
14251,1272205,"Dark red, full of tannins and acid. Long aftertaste. Clearly a keeper for another min 3 years "
14252,1272205,"This wine is by far one of the best wine from Portugal that I have tasted. It would have been best in 2 to 3 years. Hint of leather, oak and cherry!"
14253,1272205,Definitely well made!!!!
14254,1272205,"4,25⭐️. This a powerful but extremely approachable Blend based on Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo). I really like the style, oaky but well integrated. needs a lot of oxygen. "
14255,1272205,"Very nice nose with black fruits and oak. On the palate, this wine is powerful with a good balance between acidity and tannins and notes of  black fruit, cassis,  oak and  leather. "
14256,1272205,"Tinta Roriz or tempranillo compared to Touriga Nacional in my book is inferior at least in Douro valley. The style was similar to the reserva of TN but the grape just is not as warm and approachable at the age I was tasting them (3-4 years). Aromas of ripe fruit, cassis and pine buds. Quite robust body with gripy tanins and long finish. I can imagine other people like this better than the touriga nacional. Like comparing Bordeaux right and left banks. :)"
14257,1272205,"75% Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo).  Fire on the nose (spice and alcohol in high intensity), burnt wood, red fruit - something approaching a pomegranate flavor?, fine tannins, high acid, and toast.  Dense, but not the same structure as the Grand Reserva made with Touriga Nacional.  I don't quite get the floral or cocoa aromas they list on their sheer"
14258,1272205,Smooth.  Refined.  Sophisticated.  Subtle.  Well balanced.  A beautiful decrescendo.
14259,1272205,"Good taste and fruity , you keep the flavor after drink which make you really enjoying."
14260,1272205,Fruity and complex. Fantastic smooth accompaniment to red meat
14261,1272205,"A stunning quality Douro blend of 75% Tinta Roriz w. 25% being a field blend. Aged 16m in new French oak & 6m in bottle.  Deep purple. Lovely purity, fresh & ripe w. black cherry, cherry, raspberry & loganberu. Rich & creamy w. violet & bitter cherry stone. Youthful w. well-integrated vanilla & creamy anise/liquorice spice.  Dry. Well-balanced w. superbly ripe black cherry, raspberry, creamy cassis, anise & cinnamon. Blackberry & high tannins. High acid, m+ body, m+ alc & an accomplished long finish. Great."
14262,1272205,Full bodied wine. Such a great one!!!!
14263,1272205,Deep purple red color. Complex nose aroma with spices notes of black fruits.In mouth is harmonious and denotes a solid structure. Good acidity. This wine have great potential for maturation in bottle. Long finish
14264,1142434,Best port I have tasted. I prefer Ruby over tawny and this port definitely settle why that is. So much character and taste. I love it .
14265,1142434,"Fantastic Vintage Porto,  from 1994,  a medium to pale brown color,  with garnet rim.  Nose: pronounced, fried black fruit, dried fruit, fried raspberry, dried plum, prunes, dried fig, dates, golden raisins, candied bananas, molasses, caramel, baked almonds, hazelnut,, molasses, honey, sweet spices, cedar. Wine full body, elegant, smooth, with great balance between sugar, fruitiness and acidity, nice velvety texture, complex. Finish long, elegant."
14266,1142434,"Outstanding!!!! Dry fruits black currant cooked fruit, fruit cake.... Full body long finish high intensity high alcohol!!!"
14267,1142434,"Smooth, balanced, complex. "
14268,1142434,Absolutely fantastic port.
14269,1142434,"This ended in a dogfight!! This... or the 92..and in the middle of the dessert!!...close call..for me..92....why? Balance!...but oh my, they are both so good..."
14270,1142434,A soft and sweet vintage port. It have so much to offer without being too spicy. You can drink it alone or with lamb like we did.
14271,1142434,Nice....but 2000 is a bit better and probably has more potential
14272,1142434,Excellent balance between sweetness and red berries😋
14273,1142434,"Nice pepper taste then very smooth finish, was a nice treat!!! Was   a 1994 vintage,,😂😂"
14274,1142434,"Deep cherries and figs, intense ripe fruit, good body and structure."
14275,1142434,"Solid firm port tastes, low key nose. Very tight at the centre which suggests some further age may help relax, round out and open up this port. Unsure it can make the trip. Pleasant enough, but outclassed by Tesco finest  vintage 2000 which we drank over precious days."
14276,1142434,"I bought this some years ago as a reminder of my middle daughters birth year. No reason to open but just had an itch to open and decant it. BOY, this did not disappoint. I was not familiar with this brand. Was purchased only for the year. There was a little bit of sediment but the color, aromas and overall palate left me with complete satisfaction. A Long, smooth finish with only 1 regret that I didn't buy more.  "
14277,1142434,Nothing wrong with this. A bit of flavor lacking due to age  light rust to ruby color. 
14278,1142434,"Spicy, pebber, fruit, figs,  "
14279,6668959,"Light smell oc citrus and also little pear taste light balanced with mild acid, aftertaste is good gentle Very versatile with food!  "
14280,6668959,"Fruity, plenty of lime, really nice overall. "
14281,6668959,"White Douro blend of Malvasia Fino, Viosinho, Gouveio, Rabigato, Codega do Larinho and Arinto.  Fresh and crispy.  Flowers, citrus and yellow peach. Vibrant acidity.  Well done for small money 👍 "
14282,6668959,"Light straw yellow color, aroma of  lime and lemon. A bit flat on the palate, light citrus and pear flavor, little to no aftertaste. "
14283,6668959,Fresh dry very pleasant summer wine
14284,6668959,"Yellow green , very intense aroma,white fleshed , floral , mineral and citrus fruit on the alluring nose. In the mouth it shows amplitude, vibrant acidity with a pleasant freshness. Lasting and persistent finish with undertones of chalky mineral, pear skin and crushed lime fruit."
14285,6668959,"2017. Classic medium good red from Douro valley. Berry 👃. Mouth is full, some spices but somehow flat and boring. Good for food, not too good for tasting alone."
14286,6668959,"Straw coloured. Fills the mouth with fruity stone fruit, minerals and chalk. "
14287,6668959,This wine is definitely a pinch above your usual grocery store wines and can be appreciated by everyone. Short on a nose however has finesse which is round and finished. I wish I could store a bottle for next year’s visit to Portugal.
14288,6668959,"Very well balanced very short end meaning the it doesn’t leave a taste in the mouth after the drinking. Slight taste of lemon it’s very easy to drink, good tannins more on the acid side, just lovely"
14289,6668959,Fruity & good Value for money
14290,6668959,Others were better. 
14291,6668959,young wine. A little expressive aroma. In the mouth it is fresh and denotes some fruit. Short end
14292,6668959,Great easy drinking wine and good value
14293,6668959,"Very nice, fruity and balanced"
14294,3664438,"A nice wine, the day before Christmas. Golden yellow with a hint of green in the glass. Nose is very broad starting with citrus fruit, stone fruit, and ending with preserved fruit with delicate hints of oak, especially vanilla. The taste is complex with yellow fruits intertwined with wooden characteristics. The finish is really long with a lot of acidity and minerality. "
14295,3664438,"A somewhat miserly score for this birthday blowout, that didn’t quite hit the heights vivino told me it might.  Dense green and slightly oily. Stewed apple and custard nose.  Oxidative and slightly waxy on first impressions, cross-fading into creamy vanilla notes on the finish.  Nice enough but didn’t really see the value. "
14296,3664438,"A definite 4,3* wine, very lush and exceptionally overwhelming. Cream, cacao, moccha, fennel, vanilla, fine espresso, some ripe stone fruit.  Would try it with an oldtimes classic, sea bass in salt crust. Only needs good companion on and at the table."
14297,3664438,"Going to buy a case today, great evening starter "
14298,3664438,Pairing: Burrata and figs
14299,3664438,My meal goes on..here is a super-rich wood-aged wine riped with tropical fruits and packed with toast flavors. It is already mature with an attractive oxidative edge from the new barrels that adds complexity to the fruitiness.
14300,3664438,What an amazing wine. Taste like a Portwine just not that strong. You can smell an taste the oak in every angle but sweet at the same time. I had the 2013 version
14301,1722302,Very intense and flavored
14302,1722302,Excellent wine - medium bodied and food friendly. Enjoyed with 6hr slow roasted lamb shoulder in Lisbon. Not all wine needs to be fancy to suit the moment perfectly.
14303,1722302,"3.5 Good nose of savoury biscuits , almonds and Fresh hay, first sip on opening was light and thin, but dry and slightly acidic. Palate a little sharp, and lacking in fruit.  Needs food.. but for me even then nothing memorable"
14304,1722302,"A cherry and spicy aroma. In terms of taste, light bodied, persistent and complex. "
14305,1722302,A bit stunted. Starts well but disappears. 
14306,1722302,Delicious example of Biaradda and defo worth a try ! ❤❤🍷🍷
14307,1722302,Drinkable wine with good ratio between price and quality. Smooth with light tanin at the end but not deep feeling.
14308,1722302,"Violet and leather on the nose, blackberry with a hint of tobacco on the palate. Quite polished "
14309,1722302,Washed our steak down very nicely.

14311,1722302,Love at first sight.
14312,1722302,Had it open for one hour before tasting and it could have had a bit more of time. Intense purple Dão with a leathery
14313,1722302,"It is very classy and elegant, with very ripe tannins, powerful black fruits and intense, perfumed flavors. This wine could certainly age for 5–10 years. "
14314,1722302,Very nice full balanced red but with a slight sweet aftertaste that reminded me of Pinot noir even though this was a mix of four grapes and nothing to do with Pinot noir 
14315,1722302,"Very nice red blend from Bairrada, Portugal. I got this bottle directly from winery, after relaxing and picturesque ride from Luso. Wine itself consists of 30% Baga, 30% Touriga Nacional, 25% Shiraz and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and it aged 6 months in new oak barrels. It has dark ruby colour, nose is very rich and pleasant, while palate reveals berries. Wine is well balanced and long lasting."
14316,1463733,"Modern red from Portugal, red berries juice, cherry, plum, violet, chemical notes and seeet spices Light and drinkable palate with soft tannins and high acidity "
14317,1463733,"Medium ruby in color with a developing medium plus intensity nose. Red cherry, raspberry, blueberry, violets, lavender, dark cocco. Dry, high acidity, medium minus tannins, medium minus body, low alcohol, medium minus intensity on the body. Tastes slightly carbonic.

14323,1463733,"Very Jimmy. Strong on the raspberry,  now give me some toast."
14324,1463733,"Hard to enjoy this red Vinho Verde that shows pronounced barnyard funk and Brett mixed with fresh dark fruit, spices and dry tannins. "
14325,1463733,Aroma of red fruit and tomato vegetable juice. Notes of sour cherry and forest floor.
14326,1463733,A bit disappointed in the first red Vinho Verde I've bought. Funny burnt bacon and dark berries in the bouquet. Highly acidic. Mildly bubbly.
14327,1463733,"This needs to open a bit. First out of the bottle it was lightly bubbly and a bit astringent, but once it sits in the glass for a while, the acidity is wonderfully balanced with the juicy fruit. It’s excellent with food. Yummy and a good value."
14328,1463733,"Surprising and full bodied slightly effervescent red Vinho Verde. Great on its own, I wonder if it could be chilled a little?  "
14329,1463733,Fruity almost full body but with high acidity!
14330,1463733,"Light medium body, some red cherries and spices"
14331,2309624,Pale yellow. Exuberant on the nose with lots of notes of tropical fruit. Some sweetness on the mouth but just the right amount of acidity. Long finish. Great Douro White. 
14332,2309624,"The perfect Douro wine to start before eating if you're looking for a good wine! Dry, tropical fruit notes, long finish "
14333,2309624,"Yummy accompaniment to hot pot. Citrus, tropical fruit (pineapple and melon), some salinity. Tasty!"
14334,2309624,"3.6 aromatic, fruit - pear, apple and tropical fruit. Moderate acidity . Round and easy going"
14335,2309624,"Grassy wine, nice bouquet, long finish"
14336,2309624,"Cork did not smell bad, but man, tastes corked to me. Want to love it, but not to be.  Ah, not the best the Douro has to offer. "
14337,2309624,"Happy white ☪️-Saturday, unofficial for @[1|16425004|Vita in Vinum]😉)  This ☪️ontraste wine is made by ©️onceito & it contains 50% Codega (full name is Codega do Larinho) ©️-🍇 in the blend!

Ok summer wine:3.5🌟. Looking forward to my official 🔠🍷!"
14338,2309624,"Great aroma of tropical fruit and citrus, it is almost perfume! Otherwise, it is straw yellow in color, medium dry, with moderate acidity. Good flavors, with tropical and citrus notes as well. It is ok in the olfactory and gustatory dimensions. Finally, 2 common places in my thoughts on wines: the label reveals alc. in the 13º, which is a lot for table wine, constituting a less gastronomic aspect and also announcing added sulfites, which are toxic chemicals (Online wine tasting with the producer/ sample)..."
14339,2309624,"Herbal and green apple, aromas. Fresh mineral and slightly pungent with just a hint of oak. Very gastronomic. "
14340,2309624,"intensive, nice though "
14341,2309624,"Citrus, honey, minerality, cat pee "
14342,2309624,Not my type too sweet
14343,2309624," Very round, bruised apple, salinity like olive brine, earth  Tart and crisp, medium light body but heavy palate finish, long honey ginger finish   Touch of residual sugar, medium acidity  Slightly hot 3.9  Toasted sourdough , the sea, tuna with lemon "
14344,2309624,Super interesting and smart wine!
14345,2309624,16.99 drink again. Grass. Apple interesting bitter finish (In a good way) nice mineral. Bright lemon. 
14346,1274033,"Deserves its 4+ rating. Full, rounded, with grace and elegance. Deep dark cherry, plum, a touch of vanilla, some leather and spice and a smooth finish. A sprinkling of oak goes well but does not overpower the other flavors. Lots to enjoy with this one."
14347,1274033,"Very dry, deep and long-finished duoro one"
14348,1274033,"Like chocolate covered strawberries dipped in a coffee ice cream. Fruity with some weight, like silken Renaissance wall hangings. Quite nice."
14349,1274033,"Excellent wine with notes of blackberry, dark cherry and a little blueberry and plum. My first unoaked, surprisingly light taste compared to the strenght of 14%"
14350,1274033,Excellent red lots of flavours and goes well with the bbq 
14351,1274033,"Purple colour. Elegant and subtle nose. Velvety on the mouth with fruity notes (red fruits, pear). Fresh and vivid. Medium body. Great unoaked Douro. "
14352,1274033,Someting about a really wine… thats douro! That’s it!
14353,1274033,"What a great wine! Enjoyed every sip of it. A bold wine that dares to have a bold taste. Smell of tobacco, taste of licorice, black cherry. Fits perfect with red meat and old, heavy cheese."
14354,1274033,"🇵🇹 Bom Douro, produzido em Covas do Douro . Feito com uvas das castas Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz e Tinto Cão. Bebido em casa do pai.  🇬🇧 Good Douro, produced in Covas do Douro. Made with Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz e Tinto Cão. Drank it até my father's house."
14355,1274033,"I did not have high expectations for this young Duoro. It is non oaked. Intense ruby color. Beautiful nose with red fruit, cherry, herbaceous notes, spices, smoke. Medium acidity, medium tannins. It is fresh but med+ bodied. Really enjoyed it. Excellent value."
14356,1274033,Drinking this excellent red with friend and family in Portugal 🇵🇹  A 101 birthday party for Mamae e Papai 95 years old.  Bold but not over powering. Hint of plum and very light oak.  Excellent with Petite Petite Chicken 
14357,1274033,"Rapidly becoming a stock wine in our house, lovely dark colour and fruity nose, unoaked it says, well it’s very nicely matured in any case  Nice dark fruit nose, blackberry, blackcurrant and a promise of jam  In mouth the promise is delivered and has a really pleasant long finish, great with any red meat this time with roast lamb"
14358,1274033,Surprisingly delicate and  comprehensive taste for an unoaked wine.  
14359,1274033,"A pleasant red wine. Rich smell, with some notes of red fruit, moderate tannins but long enough, good structure. A good everyday wine. Very pleasant. "
14360,1274033,Black fruit with long legs! Blackberry and oak and some coffee in the end. A bit to young keep it in cellar for 3-5 years. 
14361,1196206,"A colour that reminds of ripe blood and instils in me vampiric urges. The nose is overwhelming like the aromas of the incoming high tide of the southern Indian ocean. Smooth and profound dark berries, lush oak and subtle layers of spice. I taste and all I can say is ""oh... this is good"". Smooth like Egyptian Cotton after a hot long shower, a palate that changes as the wine slides down the tongue from initial ripe blackberry to smooth ripe plum, all tempered by oak and age. A lasting finish. Happy newyear"
14362,1196206,"Mellow and silky wine. Nose is a bit delicate, in the mouth smooth fruits, restrained tannines and right amount of wood. Finish medium length."
14363,1196206,"Aromas of plums and black fruit, wet earth, some leather and sweet spice. Good acidity with smooth tannins and with nice long finish. A very well balanced Syrah in an elegant fresh style giving great pleasure"
14364,1196206,Portugal wine....cheers everyone 
14365,1196206,"Solid red by Bento dos Santos. Not the best bottle of this wine, just an averagely good one 😎"
14366,1196206,"Liquorish,  plum,  hardly any wood,  quite shallow"
14367,1196206,"Elegant, but with character !"
14368,1196206,GREAT !!! A must buy.
14369,1196206,Lovely and tasteful wine. Big surprise as first time I drunk wine from Lisbon
14370,1196206,Harmoniza frutos do mar!
14371,1196206,"And we opened another one last night, a fantastic visitor from Portugal, but unfortunately we liked him so much, he had a short stay ..... a nice deep ruby red in the glass, a nice nose of black cherries, blackberry, pepper. On the palate with air an wonderful long, wide and soft wine, ripe fruits, well balanced, blackberry, cherries, pepper, mocha and chocolate, some barrique. Lingering long ...  heavy wine for just a glass, but with some cheese perfect, better thought with red meat"
14372,1196206,"Dark red wine. Well balanced nose with black fruit, pepper and dark chocolate. Tobacco, dark fruit and a hint of vanilla in the palate. Very well balanced wine. Long lasting finish. Great wine. "
14373,1196206,"Quinta do Monte D'Oiro Reserva 2009. One of my favourite vineyards in Portugal. This tasting note is completely biased by my tasting preference. For me this wine has a perfect nose, and impressive nose to mouth combo. 👃 19/20 👄 18/20 👁️ 17/20 ⏳ 16/20"
14374,1196206,"Vacation @Porto, tasting admiring Douro river. Intense red color, berry aromas, dark chocolate notes, elegant, full bodied, interesting acidity, rich tannins, firm structure, long finish. Paired with a local goat cheese, spectacular!"
14375,1196206,"Low acidity, light bodied  Minerals, green apples  Light, fresh Long finish with toast "
14376,2305301,"Awesome drinking! Complex, full bodied, rich of soft tannins. Certainly the best Douro's wine that you money can buy. Mandatory buy!"
14377,2305301,Rich and complex - delicious and brilliant. 
14378,2305301,Mellow tannins and fruity.  This is a blend of old vines and goes down real easy.  Serve slightly cooler than room temperature and enjoy.
14379,2305301,Great White Wine! Fat and fruity. Amazing!
14380,2305301,"Mid intense yellow with delicate and discreet of peach, lemon, passion fruit, lychee, orange zest, jasmine and lemon zest. The wine has a very high aging potential, rich, textured and structured. Medium+ finish "
14381,2305301,"Quite a lot of sweetness on the palate. Quite fino sherry on nose. A little oak, some yeast and Flor. A very nice wine. "
14382,2305301,"Mineral dry, soft fruit essence with floral effect and lasting palate which finishes clean and without acidity. "
14383,2305301,Very smooth. Fantastic with spicy tomato pasta. 
14384,1239731,"3,85. Golden yelliw color with the slightest greenish hues. Fresh, young and fruity with obvious notes of lemons and green apples. Slightly fizzy as the whites can be from this region. Pretty good gastronomical wine. Would of been even better when opened in a hot summer day."
14385,1239731,Average saline vinho verde. Very light bodied apple lemon short finish 
14386,1239731,Golden colour. Slight sparkle. Smooth pear and green apple. Honey and minerals. 
14387,1239731,"Wine spritzer, tangy green apple, not pleasant, was hoping for more of an Albariño feel, but no."
14388,1239731,Strong character vs price expectation. Positively surprised
14389,1239731,"super easy going, light and somewhat wildish wine"
14390,1239731,Fresh and with small bubble
14391,1239731,Light and fruity. 
14392,1239731,Not sweet dry with a little zip
14393,1239731,Bring on the sun and bring out the vinho verde!  Great value at just £8 as this delivers that effervescent citrus goodness. Pineapple and golden delicious apple with an acidity that is weighted to allow for glugging. 
14394,1239731,A good  VV (a style I like a lot). Upweighted the score to allow for the value.    Bubbly and spritzy - even mid-bottle top ups see the inside of the glass lined with bubbles.   Muted nose but the palette is long and zesty - like a complex limeade.   Good with food and disappeared quickly. 
14395,1239731,"Nose - apples, apricot, honey, peaches. Flowers. Mouth-  acid, but little bit of sweetness. Rounded, medium. Medium long finish."
14396,1239731,"Perfect Vinho Verde white wine from the north side of Portugal. Light bodied white wine with a fruity and fresh aftertaste. Very fresh and crisp wine. Taste of green apple, peach and pear."
14397,1239731,Brilliant zesty young wine! If only it cost 3-4Euro like in Portugal. 
14398,1239731,"Wonderfully crisp, dry white with hints of bubble. Notes of green apple and slight citrus. To be drank young. Would go down well in the heat."
14399,2023285,"🍇 assemblage:Viosinho,Rabigato,Verdelho,Arinto, Moscatel Galego Branco 🏺SS 💪12.5 👀Pale straw, greenish, very small rim, legs fine as hairs 👃The Moscatel is obvious, Perfume, citrus, orange zest, grapefruit, the ocean, grass, Dash of apricot/honey and mineral background. 👅High minus acidity, bit of fatiness, dry and very fresh, citrus family Starts, minerals end in the palate. Lengthwise 5sec ⭐3.6+ 0.2 for the price(4,2euro) "
14400,2023285,"Five different grape varietals go into this particular creation which is cool, crisp and fresh at first in the mouth, the flavours of the fruits developing later with greengage, melon and lime citrus tempered with red apple, pert acidity showing it’s hand well at the cleansing finish. Very refreshing and versatile."
14401,2023285,"Fruity, citrus especially, a light colour to it and a medium finish. Not so sweet or dry right in the middle I’d say. Very enjoyable."
14402,2023285,"(87/100) A bit better than 2018 vintage. Very citric, crisp and great acidity. Good value for money"
14403,2023285,A nice subtle white wine. 
14404,2023285,"Great little wine, touch of citrus, pineapple, apple, melon. "
14405,2023285,"5 🌟star 👃nose.  Typical Douro,  mineral, some tropical,  some 🥒cucumber,   citrus,  cold stone. Mouth is watery,  short,  dossapointing.  "
14406,2023285,"Beautiful and clear yellow, citrus and floral notes, acidic, persistent and fresh ending "
14407,2023285,"Fruity, very fresh, nice for hot summer nights. "
14408,2023285,"Weird, once again I find my opinion is far away from the average. This blend of so many different Portuguese grape varieties wasn't exactly my cup of tea. Just too empty for my taste."
14409,2023285,Perfect result of the unique interaction between nature and human effort 😂
14410,2023285,"Citrus, grape a hint of sparkling  "
14411,2023285,"Fruity, smells very fruity. This what I expect from white wine. "
14412,2023285,Too acidic and too dry for my taste
14413,2023285,"Fresh,crisp medium dry white. Great value for money. "
14414,1162976,"5 stars for ultimate potential, probably more like 3.5-4 for drinking right now, but no surprises there. This will be magnificent. Right now it's a little disjointed; you have the tannins, the fruit, the heat but they hit you separately rather than melding together seamlessly the way they will with another 20/30/40 years in the bottle. Fun to taste a port this good this young, but wouldn't do it as a matter of course!"
14415,1162976,"Lunch at Devin By Sephi.  Super concentrated nose bursting of dark ripe fruit, cassis, tobacco, sigarbox, roasted almond, cedar wood, raisins and dried figs.  Start very sober in the mouth but that's just for a few seconds, after that it was an explosion of sweet black and red fruits, savory tannins and undertones of herbs that offers a generous filled long finish.  Outstanding.  4.6🌟"
14416,1162976,"4.6. Clear, inky purple. Clean, medium plus intensity aroma of blackberry, plum, blueberry, mocha, orange zest, vanilla. Sweet, high acidity, high tannins, medium body and long finish. Palate has lots of black fruit, chocolate and butterscotch. Delicious with traditional pairing of Stilton cheese. Outstanding. "
14417,1162976,Dry raisins and sumptuous vanilla flavors that warm the palate with spicy oakiness.
14418,1162976,"I know it's young, but I was impatient to try one of these ""fabled"" 2011s, so I drank this with friends over a period of a couple of days. Like an unfolding ballet this was many different drinks over time - starting with blackcurrant, then moving towards ""grape brandy"", it then gained an edge and lost some fruit, but a few hours later the fruit was back, blackberries this time, and the finish got longer. Right now this is simply lovely - in 20 years time this could well be a classic."
14419,1162976,"Rating: 4.1. Followed the Château Cheval Blanc with this hearty 30 year old Niepoort port. Dark, full bodied and smooth with a limited 19% ABV. Expressing aromas to gig, rhubarb, pomegranate, dates and apricots with a tantalizingly sweet array of flavors to plums,black cherry, nutmeg, vanilla, Belgian dark chocolate and a hint of espresso at its end. Simple, yet cloyingly satisfying. Interesting port; will have again! "
14420,1162976,Still very young but what surprised me was the purity and power of fruits. This is readily drinkable already. 
14421,1162976,Excellent port with dark fruit as well as fig/prune undertones. This will definitely be one of my to go to ports from now on.
14422,1162976,"2015 - plenty of dark fruits and nice spiciness, cacao notes, dry finish - lovely baby, intense and generous with nice tannins "
14423,1162976,"This is a real Vintage Port -  This is Niepoort! Vintage Port is only produced in the best years, 2007 was a really good Port-wine vintage Purple-(red) colour, nearly black Aromas of chocolate, dried herbs, spieces, amarena cherries and vanilla with an oaky touch On the palate complex and concentrated with still young tannins; really smooth with a touch of pepper and berries.  Long finish with a fruity aftertaste and hints of leather Lots of potential- wait another 5-10 years! That's a true Niepoort Port!"
14424,1162976,"ECLECTIC JUICE  Looking for Port outside the mainstream? Enter Dirt Niepport, a Renaissance man with a slight aversion to tradition. From a 98 pt vintage, this bottle is packed with thick, chewy flavors!  Dense purple tumbling into the glass, it emits aromas of beautiful violet & blue fruits. Thick but delicate, the palate reveals flavors of blueberry, licorice & cherry cola with silky tannins and a light woody note, all coated in a soft leathery finish that goes on for minutes. Elegant! 93 pts"
14425,1162976,"Simply beautiful. Pronounced with cherry, strawberry, jam, licorice, tobacco, vanilla, dark chocolate, pepper. High acidity, high tannins, full body, high alcohol, sweet. "
14426,1162976,"Wine is clear with deep intensity & ruby color. Nose is clean with medium+ intensity of youthful aromas of bramble, blueberries, blackberries, jamminess, butter, vanilla, oak, toast & leather. Wine is sweet with medium+ acidity & tannin, high alcohol, full body, pronounced flavor intensity & a long finish. Flavors are same as nose. This port is outstanding with potential for further aging."
14427,1162976,"Wow! Of the 4 bottles of this Niepoort vintage I’ve opened, this is by far the most impressive and remarkably different than the others: Dark, intense and with rapier-like tannins (I even think of some Taylor’s character, here, but even more generous in the best ways of the Niepoort style); with sweet cherry resolve on the finish, I could only wonder what wine this would have been in 10-15 more years...clearly a (delicious) mistake to have opened at this stage."
14428,1162976,"Opaque and full bodied. Creme de cassis, marzipan, winter spice, bitter cocoa, mocha, crushed violets with granite schist minerality. More floral and fruity on the nose with more minerality showing on the palate. Intense and unctuous with a long silky finish and mouthfeel. Already delicious at this young age. Another 20 years should smoothen out its rough edges. Yummy."
14429,1150850,"Portuguese wine made of Cócegas + Rabigato + Gouveio + Viosinho grapes, fermented in stainless steel tanks and aged with battonage for 6 months in French oak barrels. Light and clear golden yellow color. Not intense white and yellow fruit and some floral aromas with notes of spices, mineral and, lately, butter and honey. Medium body (13.5%) Douro region wine with strong acidity and fair alcohol. Finish is strong, dry, delicious and persistent. An 82-GB pts still young wine."
14430,1150850,"Well Balanced Douro, with a lot going on for it, though it need another year or two in the bottle to show all its potencial."
14431,1150850,"Ripe fruit, excellent acidity. Tannins still need to smooth a little. Next year should probably be in the right point."
14432,1150850,"Ripe fruit, balsamics, mineral hints. Fleshy, fresh, tasty, velvety. Ripe fruit on the palate. Lingering "
14433,1150850,"Equilibrado, frutas do bosque."
14434,1150850,"Very average, ripe black fruit; plum, blackberry, some blueberry, oak -not well integrated- and a hint of violets. Juicy, straightforward, fresh."
14435,1150850,"👃 well balanced with earth notes such as grass, truffles and charcoal.  🍷 light bodied, balanced, extremely smooth, medium acidity and good tannins with red fruit. Doesn’t require food but it with pair nicely with lamb or beef. "
14436,1150850,Casa do Lado Lombada
14437,1150850,"Casa do lado, lombada "
14438,1150850,"Good balance of black fruits, wood, tannins and alcohol. Decent value. "
14439,1150850,Very interesting taste of resin. 
14440,1150850,A good Douro red. Warming and very well made 
14441,1150850,Semi-body Reserva with rich Taste. Good with meat and Asian food 
14442,1150850,Exactly the wine I like
14443,1150850,"Smooth and gentle. The full bodied complex and wonderful fruitiness of the Touriga Nacional grape is well developed in this wine although not yet to its full potential (almost). Anyways, a pleasure."
14444,1936314,"4 stars. Bold body with medium plus acidity  and velvety tanins. Just a touch of sweetness and high alcohol. Blacks plums and ripe cherry, vanilla, oak. Moderate to long finish."
14445,1936314,Soft and good. Kind of Joker wine. Not sure I left my car keys
14446,1936314,"Not my favourite Douro, but still a decent quaff. Smooth enough, fruity enough, better value wines to be found in same category."
14447,1936314,"Very fruity with rich and ripe tannins. 4,25-/5"
14448,1936314,"Nice red, dry with aroma of oak, leather and some smoke. On the palate similar and a touch of red fruit. Well structured, medium balanced and a delightful, long finish. "
14449,1936314,"Nose of leather, blackberries, subtle cinnamon. Tannins on the attack with some cherry tones. Good acidity and tannins in the finish. Bright and cheerful. Very likeable!"
14450,1936314,"Ruby-red color in the glass! On the nose expressive fruity notes with balsamic and floral nuances! On the palate very elegant with soft tannins, beautiful acidity and a long finish! Cheers!"
14451,1936314,"Ruby red cherry, balsamic and Okey with soft and delicate tannins. Floral notes with fruity freshness. Surprisingly lovely with fresh fruits. "
14452,1936314,"I think it’s an amazing wine, it’s not too harsh on the buds, it’s very enjoyable, taste great with food. It has the right amount of fermentation. It’s light. I love it "
14453,1936314,"Youthful, bright with plums, black cherries, raspberries and cherry jam. "
14454,1936314,"Soft, fresh and tanine flavored"
14455,1936314,It’s a fair value from a great winery.
14456,1936314,"meaty, game, cherry, raspberry, blackcurrant, plum, jammy. good value "
14457,1936314,3.5 Half decent duoro everyday wine. Cheers 🍷
14458,1936314,"A rather mediocre red from Douro, Portugal. Red cherries on the nose. A bit too flat on the palate with the flavours of red fruits. Acidity is too high and tannins are rather far from being polished. Not worth the money spent."
14459,1274393,"This 2016 blend consists of 3 grape varieties; the most important one is the Alicante Bouschet with 50% (also the main grape for the winery), Touriga Nacional 40% and Cabernet Sauvignon 10%.  The Alicante Bouschet gives the wine a deep ruby red color and nice aromas of dark fruit, like ripe cherry, but also chocolate and cacao. The tannins are nicely balanced and the wine has a great aftertaste with prevailing secondary notes. An elegant wine and great example of the beauty that Portugal provides. "
14460,1274393,"Good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. However, it has a very intense fruity / floral (violet?) note, something flourishing, which, lately, is emerging in many Portuguese wines from north to south (which I don't like very much). But in the sensorial dimension it`s a pleasant wine from Alentejo. Contains sulfites. Alcohol in the level 13,5.°."
14461,1274393,"A different style red who thin this property super range of wines. Spicy and zesty, less concentrated than other reds in the range and region, good for early drinking. Probably the least favourite wine in the range for me"
14462,1274393,Unique perfumed red. 
14463,1274393,"Ok wine, nice fruit, a bit of liquorice and leather and a nice longish after taste"
14464,1274393,"Outstanding wine. Light, full of flavour, delicate bouquet. Great with ""meaty"" fish too. "
14465,1274393,"Full-bodied red with dark cherry, black fruit, earth, some leather, a bit of vanilla, and oak notes. Great with robust meats and cheeses. "
14466,1274393,"Blend of Alicante Bouschet, Syrah and Touriga Nacional. Dark ruby color. Aroma of red fruits and chocolate. Perfect for red meat."
14467,1274393,"Blend of 50% Alicante Bouchet, 40% Touriga Nacional and 10% Syrah from Alentejano 🇵🇹.  Black fruit, bramble and cherry. Hints of mint and violets.  Well balanced. Velvety texture and smooth tannins.   Not my fave style but it’s just yummy 😋"
14468,1274393,"A very good wine with potential to turn outstanding. Medium ruby to garnet. In the nose, pronounced wit cherry, red currant, dried strawberry, violet, floral, coconut, thyme, tomato leaf. On the palate, medium intensity with primary, secondary, and tertiary flavors. High acidity, full body, high tannins, bone-dry, high alcohol.  "
14469,1274393,Very delicious. Deep dark purple colour. Spice and baked apple pie on the nose. Palate of dark cherries and a hint of ginger. Long finish. 
14470,1274393,It is a very good white wine! It presented a lot of  citric aromas and flavors! It has an excellent acidity and a long final! 
14471,1274393,"Very subtle on the nose, but so full bodied , cedar , oak , some sweet notes liqoirice , Chocolate , "
14472,1274393,"Nice ‘cellar smell’. I enjoyed this, without any further notes"
14473,1274393,"Subtle nose, very well balanced "
14474,1175612,"Pale amber with a significant colourless rim.  The nose starts subtly but with air becomes very penetrating with raisins cinnamon, leather and dried flowers.  Marzipan, sweet soy milk, coffee and figs, Nutty overtones.  Complex and tertiary."
14475,1175612,"Cloudy deep tawny colour. Medium nose with fig, raisins, prune, caramel and cinnamon. Pronounced taste of fig, caramel, cinnamon, raisins, prune and vanilla. Long and sweet finish. High acidity. Light tannins. Full body. A great Colheita. Goes well by itself or with fruit, caramel or cream based deserts or cheese."
14476,1175612,"Single vintage and Quinta harvest and bottled 2009 what could go wrong? Not much, well balanced Tawny Port where the sweetness of the wine doesn’t take overhand. Perfectly on its own or to the usual blue cheese etc. 4.25⭐️"
14477,1175612,"Ups! Needed a port for my portwine sauce. This was the only one in my chelf. Ok...high class sauce this time. Was abit unsure if I had overstored this, but it was absolutely stunning. Delicious nose of almonds, nuts, raisins and spices. It exploded in mouth. Still lots of acidity here, nutty and dried raisins...some caramel, ripe red apples, vanilla and a rich overlaying taste of different spices. Very consentrated. Estimated length: 5-6min."
14478,1175612,"Elegant and powerful though a notch less to my taste than their 2005. Raisins and stems, figs, bitter cocoa and more. Superbly long and balanced with a light sustaining bitterness in the finale. Gorgeous !!"
14479,1175612,"A nice and complex port - notes of caramel, coconut, nuts, sweet spices, tobacco, feels like little citrusy notes  - great length and great port "
14480,1175612,Perfectly in balance still with lovely soft but not too sweet fruit. Would benefit from another 10 years.

14485,1175612,"High alcohol,  strong nose of candied dry fruits. A hint of butter."
14486,1175612,"Red/orange. Dried fruit, leather, caramel and walnut on the nose. More of the same on the palate. Intense fruit with some acidity. Complex, light yet powerfull. Lovely finish"
14487,1175612,New Year and years of waiting - celebration time - top score is inevitable:-)
14488,1175612,"Full body and smooth with plenty of chocolate,coffee and dried fruit notes. Great balance.Long and lingering finish."

14491,1548080,Very lush dark fruit. Not overbearing tannin. Slightly acidic
14492,1548080,"Wow. Left it breathing for 1h in a decanter. Great coulor. Good taste of prunes, leather with some smokiness. Amazing finish."
14493,1548080,"Splendid red from Bairrada! A rich blend of Touriga Nacional, Cab-Sauvignon and Merlot, with oak aging (no proper specifications about vinification and aging). Bold, complex and concentrated, with excellent acidity and length. Deep ruby color, floral, ripe dark fruits and wild berries aromas/flavors, with notes of cassis, spices, smoke, eucalyptus, cocoa and well integrated oak. Full body and fresh, with firm yet velvety tannins and a long juicy finish. Succulent red, still growing!"
14494,1548080,"Again a wine I tried twice before but you can’t walk past one of the best Portuguese wines! It was even better than I remembered... Intense, rich nose with balsamic, some bell pepper, vanilla, black pepper, cedar and coffee followed by a palate with perfect acidity, beautifully integrated tannines, black currant, red & black cherry and an impressive finish. 4.4"
14495,1548080,"Very special blend of Touriga Nacional + Cabernet Sauvignon + Merlot from Bairrada - Portugal.  Deep ruby red color and purple rim. In the nose fresh ripe black fruits, licorice, spices, oak, vanilla, coffee, toast and fine tobacco. In the mouth the tannins are intense, firms but velvety, structured and well integrated with a elegant balance between the alcohol and acidity. Very complex wine with smooth and persistent finish. Great wine!!!"
14496,1548080,"Nice round fruit aromas like prunes and cherries, a pinch of green kitchen herbs and cedar. There’s a marvellous balance between alcohol and acidity. Somewhere you can detect subtle tannins on the fruity palate. Finish is long (what else?) This is an exercise in elegance and no mistakes were made."
14497,1548080,"I'm probably being a bit generous in my rating, but this is likely the best Bordeaux blend from Portugal I have had. Deep purplish garnet. Perfumed nose of cassis, blackberries and licorice. Same elements in the palate, as well as spices, great acidities, with good level of fruits buffering its abundant and velvety tannins, well balanced, very long finish"

14504,2117860,"89/100 Blend of Antão Vaz and Arinto. Dried white peach, stone, yogurt, and white flower. Lots of tropical fruit flavors. For a white from Alentejo, this is very good. Good texture for a stainless steel white and a long, mineral driven finish. "

14512,2117860,"A white wine from Southern Portugal? When I saw this in my weekly box, I expected a deep, velvety red as lush as my curtains! A surprise! I can see it is justifiably acclaimed and I’m sure this has lots of fans seeking a refreshing change from more typical choices. It is crisp, slightly dry, full of flavour and actually quite tropical. There is citrus and then a ‘Carmen Miranda’ (see posted pic) of fruit. Honey, chalk and flint. It’s genuinely a characterful wine with a gorgeous lime colour. Obrigado! "
14513,2117860,Good wine from Alentejo. Fresh and fruity with citrus notes and some minerality . Medium finish. 3.7pts

14519,13303,"A glass at Ramos Pinto, this was initially a little closed, particularly compared to the 1982 vintage alongside it. After some patient swirling prune and dried raspberry fruit emerges, with spice and tobacco. The palate is very smooth; sweet and chocolatey in the house style. It also has something rather savoury and mineral about it, with plenty of tannin.  The overall feel is still quite young, just entering its drinking window, with a lot to recommend it as a port for the future. 4.25*."
14520,13303,"95/100 Exceptional stuff. Notes of tertiary have begun to emerge. Notes of mushroom, red cherry, brown herbs, citrus, and tobacco. Medium bodied for Port. This still has firm tannins and will develop for many years. Complex finish with baking spice and pepper mixed with orange peel. Chewy wine. "
14521,13303,Far too young. A delight though giving it some air and time
14522,13303,"Nice, with deep sweetness, prunes and marmalade. A fine experience, but in this range I hoped for a bit more."
14523,13303,"92 Aroma had figs, raisins, dark cherries, dates and coffee. Flavor raisins, figs, dates, plums and chocolate. Medium acid and sweet."

14525,13303,Nice purple colour turning into red. Intensive forest fruits. Probably good with medium strong cheese.
14526,13303,"Super concentrated red fruit, raisins, berry jam, vanilla, oak. Viscous wine with plenty of alcohol. It needed a little more acidity in order to become perfect. "
14527,13303,"92pts me (I forgot to take pic)  The 05 is quite good and somewhat ready to drink   Nose is minty, vegetal, floral, peppery on dark berries violet and star anise with hints of dark chocolate.   Quite a heavy tannin still but ripe and focused. Powerful long minty finish with more vegetal component than other vintage port but overall quite good"
14528,13303,"Oh my God, another show stopper. Sorry about the short notes - social tasting.  The nose has super concentrated red fruit jam, baked, with some dried dark fruit and spice. The palate it super silky, with vanilla, raisins, concentrated grape musk, blackcurrant and nuts. All rounded off with strong tannins that keep the structure. Perfect."
14529,13303,"Much too young. Very complex and dense flavors of nuts, raisins, toffee, orange blossom and zest, rich red and black fruits. Medium tannins, good acidity. Endless finish. Give it another 5 years at least. (93 P)"
14530,13303,Fortified wine class. Smokey cherry and chocolate. Attack is very sweet but let it hang out for bit. The tannins are gorgeous. Great finish.

14537,4154537,"4,3⭐Awesome choice for my 300th rating.🎉 🍇Misses the Tinta Roriz(70%) on Vivino details. 👀Dark ruby. Slow tears. 👃Starts nicely with black plum, blackberry and black pepper. Evolving to show some licorice, dark chocolate, vanilla and bit of toast. 👅Balanced showing a bold profile with velvet feeling. Round and well polished tannins. Dry with spot on acidity. 🏁Persistent aftertaste with the vanilla and spices notes. 🗒️Showed a little bit of sediment, but not a bother at all. One to repeat for sure. 😃"
14538,4154537,"Smooth Portuguese red with integrated tannins, earth, mushroom and dark fruits. Paired well with steak and foie gras. Amazing."
14539,4154537,"Robust but not overly so. Balanced fruit and tannins. Could drink on its own or with, say, a BBQ."
14540,4154537,"👃 cherry, tobacco, chocolate, violet  👄  black fruit, vanilla, allspice, dark fruit, dried blackberry It needs a little breather to open up completely"

14543,4154537,"Lots of primary fruit! Black currant and blackberries. Sensing prunes as well, oak and mushrooms. Full body, soft and dry and fine tannins. Medium acidity. Drink it slightly cooled. "
14544,4154537,Great value and fantastic taste - give it a few hours out of the bottle or even better let it be for a few years more. It has potential to be much better! 🍷🍷🍷🍷👍🏻
14545,4154537,"Color  is dark red with a mature, purple shade.  Nose is good spices and at the same time it is fruit and fresh .  Taste is intense and smooth. Easy to drink and have this characterized of this mix of grapes with slice of blackberry and raspberry - as well as touch of delicious licorice and vanilla. Perfect balance, and with a nice spicy ""finish"". A good wine for the upcoming season Eastern to all cuts from lamb "
14546,4154537,"Good red blend from Northern Portugal, near High Douro valley, altitude vines . After 4 years in cellar, It is now a bold wine with great balance and aromas of dark fruits, violets & earth, with velvet tannins and a linger finish. Much better since the last time I tasted - 3y. Good value"
14547,4154537,"Very nice surprise, this Beira Interior! Animalic nose with clay and red & black fruit followed by a palate with vanilla, perfect tannines and nice acidity and capped off with a nice, lengthy finish. Top QPR => solid 4!"
14548,4154537,"Muscular yet subtle deep ruby blend in all senses! Softer but still Douro style from Beira Interior.   Multilayered, developing aromas. It starts with dried plum&caramel, black cherry&lilac leads later. Sweet tar, fig touring around. Hints of dried-herb, peat, oil.   Still fresh acid, firm tannin on the dark fruit driven palate. Bold also velvety has some mineral appeal. Herbal&oaky finale, long, dry aftertaste  It still has plenty of time to spend in a bottle. Will come back after few years.   4 points. "
14549,3334065,"3.9! La Grande Dégustation de Montréal! Very interesting Portuguese white that made think of the Loire Valley!  Minerals, lemon, saline, melon and pear all around. Medium finish. Very good."
14550,3334065,"I really liked that one, the nose gave me riesling vibe, you get petroleum and a loooot of lemon on the nose, but then the texture is huge with a smooth mouthfeel and a lovely finish"
14551,3334065,A bit of acidity but fresh and intense in mouth. Great flavour. Pairing with seafood 
14552,3334065,Good fullbodid wine

14561,3334065,Average. Too citric and tart for my likely. Lots of orange and tropical fruit.

14563,3334065,The oak in this made it come across like a CA chard. The ONLY Niepoort wine I don't like (and there are many many I love)

14569,16387,Nice and different type of white wine.  
14570,16387,"I've seen a few referring leather, tobacco or blackcurrants. This is far from the truth for me, this is not an old red wine!  This is a wonderful fruity and mineral wine, strong aromas, punchy in the mouth, full body, long finish. By fruity I mean citric (perhaps lime?) and apple mostly.  Easily drinkable alone by the end of a lot g day or with light meals (pasta, salads, some fish)."

14579,4301235,"A nice wine and value buy.  This is a wine with pleasing dark color, and nose that stands proud.  Great for meal or happy hour   3.9 "
14580,4301235,This vintage even better.  By the way: I have to stop drink wine/alcohol cause very heavy training program which will last few weeks. Hear You some day! 
14581,4301235,"Fun wine fantastic for $10!!   Typical Portuguese flavors (grapes are Touriga Syrah and Tinta Roriz).  Sweet tones, ripe dark fruit flavors.  Buy again!"

14585,4301235,Very nice berry flavors. Dry and just right amount of acidity. Need to be chilled to about 62F. Will definitely drink this again.
14586,4301235,"Welcome to Portugal! Amazing wines for 4 euros per bottle at supermarkets enter your life, that's an impressive value. Ripe dark fruits, distinctive tannins, with a dash of chocolate sweetness. Evolves when breathing "
14587,4301235,"Interesting and complex blend of syrah, touriga nacional,  tinta roriz and alicante bouschet. Dark ruby red on eye with purple reflex . Thin,  long legs slowly dropped in the glass.

14593,4301235,One of my favourite Portuguese red wines that you can find in one of the biggest discounts in Poland at this very attractive price  point. Another good vintage in my opinion although you will find some completely opposing views on VV which is perfectly normal. Nose of red cherries and oak. Smooth and dry on the palate with the flavours of ripe red cherries and notes of cinnamon. Integrated tannins and medium acidity. Pleasant but at the same time rather short finish strenghtened a bit by 14% alc. 
14594,1573014,"Deep ruby colour Nose: med intensity  Palate: dry, med+ acidity, med alcohol, high tannins (ripe, soft), med+ intensity, med+ finish Violet (some lifted aromatics), red plum, blackcurrant, blackberry, woodsmoke, cedar, licorice, white pepper, dark chocolate, hints of cigar, earth This is a well made wine. Tannins are remarkable, but of ripe nature. The whole combination works well structure-wise. Amazing value for money here. Very good quality  Suitable for bottle ageing"
14595,1573014,That'll do. Typical if slightly more oaky Dão red. Better at 16 than 18. WBA
14596,1573014,Let it breathe. Complex tobacco and blackcurrant. £9.51 PV
14597,1573014,Spicy and very smooth with cherry aromas
14598,1573014,Strawberry and pepper. Full bodied dark red. Round finish. Very good value mid week fluffed from TWS
14599,1573014,"Good body. Baked strawberry fruit with raspberry. Some herbal notes. Smoke, vanilla. "
14600,1573014,Smells nice but tannic
14601,1573014,"Pepper, dark fruit, dry, full body"
14602,1573014,Not as good as 2018 - easy drinking but not very complex - quite tangy with black cherry fruit and smoky aftertaste 
14603,1573014,Too heavy on the oak
14604,1573014,Strawberry red fruit and cherry. Some pepper spice at the end. Good value. 
14605,1573014,"Smooth, creamy blackberriesl. Zingy, acidic fruit, Intense experience"
14606,1573014,Smooth and luscious with a hint of spice and rich dark fruits. Lingering flavour on the palette. 
14607,1573014,"Very good Dão blend! Good notes of strawberry, with some pepper and oak. Nicely balanced in the mouth with a fine ending. Great value for money! "
14608,1573014,"Fruity, easy drinking - not hugely complex but it’s not expensive!"
14609,1254128,Smells like balsamic vinegar. Tasted like raisins and strawberries. 
14610,1254128,"Seems like this is the portuguese answer to PN. Well, in the nose I can find the red currant and the barnyard effect, cherries and a little raspberry too. On the palate there are some meaty accents and red berries.  But what’s the big difference? The acidity level! This wine doesn’t has the acidity level as a Burgundy PinotNoir and so it makes everything a bit dull. While sniffing, everything says PN but you don’t have that noble tension that keeps the wine interesting after some glasses. ⬇️⬇️⬇️comments⬇️⬇️⬇️"
14611,1254128,"This is a special one, very atypical for the Douro. Rufete tends to be used more in port than on its own. In table wine it goes more for freshness and lightness and is sometimes compared to Pinot Noir. This one misses a bit of complexity but has an interesting own style.  Medicinal, herbal nose with red cherry, raspberry, red currant and lots of balsamic followed by a very fresh, easygoing palate with concentrated acidity, basically no tannins, red cherry, vanilla, white pepper and rhubarb. 3.5"
14612,1254128,"Nice Portuguese red wine,  from Douro  a medium ruby color,  with cherry clearance.  Nose: ripe red forest fruity, mature fruits nuanced and pinch floral aromas.  In the mouth: wine is clearly fruity, ripe red plums, black cherries, blueberries, red berries, spices, a little toast and oak.  Wine medium heavy, with good structure, mild tannins, and a significant acidity.  Finish powerful, long."
14613,1254128,"Simply amazing!! A sweet, strawberry, cherry and wood scent. In terms of flavor, very light, smooth like a sheet of silk. It also resembles a strawberry and peach juice, with tannins in the end. "
14614,1254128,"Correct, mineral but something is missing. Too much acidity."

14617,1254128,Blackberry aromas. Soft and round. Not terribly complex but I enjoyed this.
14618,1254128,"It's been ages I enjoyed Rufete kinda Portuguese Pinot Noir. My postings are upside down and I'm starting with the youngest vintage. Not that good yet, as the older ones but impressive. In blind tasting older Rufete won against French Pinot Noir. All were surpised. Medium dark ruby colour with fine aromas and flavours of strawberry, raspberry, blackberry with gentle earthy nuances, notes of smoke, clove, oak, vanilla and a whiff of pepper. Medium-bodied, medium acidity and mild but well perceptible tannins."
14619,1254128,One rare red wine to be served chilled (10C). Nice and elegant. Medium-bodied and light nature. Good!
14620,1254128,The closest wine that I have tasted in Portugal that comes close to being a lovely Pinot Noir.
14621,1254128,"Nice, light flavored Pinot from Portugal.  "
14622,1254128,Huge wine. Big dried fruit and herbs. Nothing special. 
14623,1254128,Light iow alcohol. Red berries and a twist of oak. 
14624,3819402,Fruity and good 
14625,3819402,"Good flavor and texture, old wood aroma, good price quality relationship "
14626,3819402,"Ruby-red color in the glass! On the nose intense, beautiful aromas! On the palate  complex notes of red ripe fruits, good balance, very elegant, good acidity with a long finish! Cheers!"
14627,3819402,"Strong nose, very dark fruit but ending too duffy"
14628,3819402,Perfectly drinkable cheap white 
14629,3819402,"A remarkably well priced Alentejano, great quaffing wine"
14630,3819402,had it at portogese restaurant. nice!
14631,3819402,Medium bodied. Notes of prune.
14632,3819402,"Strange combination between nose and bouqeut, that really works. Nose oksblood, baroque, smoke and thyme. Mouth is huge acidity, medium plus tannins, zero sweetness. Bouqeut of fresh fruit, blackberry, rips."
14633,3819402,"Easy going and delicioso!! M+ acidity and raspberry-like flavor from Alicante Bouche, depth and smokiness from Aragonez, and something chocolaty about it. Very charming!!"
14634,3819402,Aroma of well ripe fruit and a bit smoky. A little sweet tannins together with fruit flavor creates a pleasing taste that balanced well. Longering is also good.
14635,3819402,Cinnamon and clove with some red fruit notes. Pleasant wine!
14636,3819402,Leve e fresco do RR Portalegre 
14637,3819402,"Chewy blackberry and cherry jam like qualities. Well balanced tanins. A full mouth of red fruit with an earthy grit. It went exceptionally well with north indian cuisine. Excellent with lamb, venison and goat."
14638,3819402,"Deep,  powerful and quite refined considering the price. It is quite intense but in a very nice way."
14639,1840663,"Black fruits, cherry, spices, oak and earthy notes. Very balanced smooth not too bolt.Fun to drink. Ideal with food but solo also possible. Recommended. "
14640,1840663,"A bargain! Indeed interesting, indigenous grape variety, good lengths and nice fruits. Goes well to many dishes. "
14641,1840663,"Oak and blackberry  tasty combined with some forest, tasty  full bodied, acid in balance. really sympathique wine ! "
14642,1840663,"Bold. dark red. Dense fruit. Soft tannins once breathed, making it pleasant to drink on its own, but matched steak (or Mac’n’cheese) very well.  Berry nice!"
14643,1840663,"Rich taste, thick. Good alone or pair with food"
14644,1840663,"Nice, balanced wine. Great price performance! "
14645,1840663,"Balanced, beautiful wine with chocolate and vanilla flavour, notes of black fruit."
14646,1840663,"Soft tanins, low acid, black fruits - pleasant palate."
14647,1840663,"Berries, earthy nice full tannic and bold. Not to heavy tho."
14648,1840663,Just outstanding promotion from delhaize
14649,1840663,"Purple red colour, medium intensity. On the nose: cherry, plum and pepper. On the palate: dry, medium (-) acidity. Medium delicate tannins. Plum, cherry, pepper and chokeberry. "
14650,1840663,"I have been a fan of this winery for quite some time, one of the first wines I drank. The quality to price ratio never disappoints!!  👃 high notes of dark fruit such as plum, blackberries with a touch of pepper and tobasco.  🍷 not so dry, feels like a young wine with more consistency. Well balanced, medium to high acidity, good tannins and medium aftertaste."
14651,1840663,"3.75. My first Douro dry red.   Deep, inky purple.   Med+ nose of ripe blackberry, cocoa, dried prune, with mild earthy compost, pipe tobacco, and volatile phenols of the barnyard variety which burn off.   Balanced but somewhat lean mouthfeel with high acidity, high fairly grippy tannins and full body.   Pronounced black pepper.  Long finish.  Not a sipping wine.   Could use a few more years in the bottle.  Curious to try more out of Douro and see how they progress over the years.  For now, pretty good QPR."
14652,1840663,"First going-out after 🦠 settling outside.  Meeting with bro and remembering how it was being in the city😁 2nd wine of the night. Touriga Nacional based blend from Douro, 2016. Bit less enjoyable than Vidal-Fleury CdR Villages, but alongside great snacks and restaurants ceiling it was very good companion😁 On the palate much more fruity with ripe blue berries, licorice. Medium body. Decent table wine! 3.5 Life’s good! Cheers to all VV friends🍷🍷🍷"
14653,1840663,"Blackfruits aroma, medium body vanilla and plums finish, pepper note. Good tannins and acidity balance "
14654,6581733,Medium body with long finish. Paired with salted filled cod and sweet potatoes. Blackberry and vanilla aromas. 
14655,6581733,Had this wine with duck in Porto and it was a real blast. We had it a little cooled and it matche perfectly 
14656,6581733,Deep ruby garnet red. Spice and ripeness on the nose. Very well balanced in the mouth with good volume and persistence.
14657,6581733,smooth and nice wine. 
14658,6581733,Really good considering price
14659,6581733," Leather, plum and vanilla. Nutmeg and cloves. Dry with noticeable tannins, which matches best with meat or other umami foods. "
14660,6581733,plum dark berries full body soft
14661,6581733,"Red berries, dark berries, black currants, hints of leather, earth and chocolate. Warm feeling, rounded, balanced tannins. Great wine for mixed foods, like tapas. Nice on it’s own too. Salud!"
14662,6581733,"A blend of 5 grapes. Lot of character. Intense and at first nose vanilla, black fruits like casais and wet leader. At mouth and later brings a lot of spices, from anis to nutmeg. "
14663,6581733,"Lovely. Big, full, long, dark. "
14664,6581733,"Smooth, not acid and with a a good ending. Taste stays all over the mouth for long. Citric, with tones of lemon grass and unripe cherry. Delicious!"
14665,6581733,"Fruity and very dry on its own, best with beef"
14666,6581733,At home with albondingas. Fruity and juicy. Spicy smell. 
14667,6581733,Great quality/price. Veey smooth wine.
14668,6581733,"Dry, soft and simple table wine.."
14669,2334566,Didn’t think this was up to much. You don’t have to chuck a Reserva onto a white wine to make it taste better. The oak overdid it. Not ideal.
14670,2334566,"Minerality, tropical, pineapple, floral, very complex and elegant"
14671,2334566,Excellent fruity and light 
14672,2334566,Ok-ish but way overpriced 
14673,2334566,"Fresh, elegant. citrus oak "
14674,2334566,"Fresh, smooth and really nice"
14675,2334566,"Perfect wine wit full body , intensive smell and test , and soft aftertaste. Vanilla , oak , citrus."
14676,2334566,"A different kind of White. Full body and not floral. Dense and with a distinct (viognier?) flavour. Reminds me of madrigal, but at a far better value."
14677,2334566,Very young but already quite sophisticated
14678,2334566,"Nose of vanilla, apple and citrus. Tastes of melon, apple and after taste of citrus.  Bold and slightly acid. Tastes better if cold. Dark yellow. No wine tears. "
14679,2334566,You can taste the Viognier and peach flavour. Had it with fish but believe that chicken would probably be better like a tajine with cooked fruit
14680,2334566,"This is an utterly beautiful blend. Hints of flowers and honey on the nose. Big (very big) mouthfeel, with an elegant and smooth texture and hints of vanilla and sweet almond. Ripe red apples and hints of pear and honey. An underlying simple structure of complimentary flavours. Excellent."
14681,2334566,"Nice white from Alentejo!  An aromatic blend of Viognier, Verdelho and Antão Vaz, vinified in new French and Hungarian oak barrels. Fruity and complex, with crisp acidity and good length. Pale yellow color, floral, peach and other yellow fruits aromas/flavors, mineral, with notes of lime, spices and an hint of vanilla. Dry, creamy and fresh, with a nice bitter finish. Very pleasant wine, that pairs well with Japanese and Peruvian food!"
14682,2334566,"Great way to start the weekend! Some fresh shrimp by the sea with some fresh white wine! Rounding off and cooling down after a satisfying win in the Euros 🇸🇪🇸🇪!   Vibrant and energetic, not to oaky, shy citrus and lots of minerals! Some fresh, tropical fruit, more fresh than sweet lingering! "
14683,2334566,"4,3. A great white Alentejo. Mature, citrus, pomerans. Bitter almond notes. Good shy minerals. Some gooseberry in the aftertaste. Brought this wine from Portugal to Sweden. Enjoying at the brink to the baltic sea with some fresh shrimps. "
14684,1162976,"Speechless The nose is luscious with figs, raisins, burnt almonds that leads to a sumptuous palate with lashings of treacle, licorice, raisins and figs with burnt caramel. The back is amazingly complex with vanilla, oak and a sublime aniseed finish. Class"
14685,1162976,"I have not had a vintage port for a while and by that point of the lunch, we were quite toast... my somm friend thought it would be fun to cut the neck of the bottles with the classic port tongs and a blow torch to warm it up. It worked and came out clean! 5 stars service and delivery. To be honest, by that point I cannot remember the full taste profile of the wine, but I remember liking it... a lunch to remember "
14686,1162976,Absolutely amazing port at niepoort winery👌
14687,1162976,Excellent port with dark fruit as well as fig/prune undertones. This will definitely be one of my to go to ports from now on.
14688,1162976,"2003 - ripe fruits notes, very charming boy for a warm vintage, peperry, jammy red fruits, intense  but still elegant and has  some finesse"
14689,1162976,"4,4 stars. At the end of a marathonic blind taste, I was not in condition anymore to take notes on this 33 years old Port.  Nevertheless, the classiness of it was stunningly obvious, with a top notch lushness, that is hard to describe in terms of its outstanding texture, that was mindblowing in conjunction with fresh elegant inky compote berry fruit, plum, fig, liquorice & prunes and a whole load of lovely smooth spices. Acidity easily caught up the sweetness, to make this a balanced luscious gem."
14690,1162976,"Superbly better than the fantastic 82 to a more modern wine, acidity, fruit and everything hangs together in this 32-year-old wine - drink it if you find it! I'm reluctant to use the word umami but there is a almost impossible intangible flavor."
14691,1162976,"93/100 It smells dark and dense, this vintage is incredibly young for its age. Notes of dark plum, black cherry, mocha, and pepper. This is very dense and the tannins are still fierce. There is a great feeling of orange peel acidity and intensity. Put this away for a couple more decades."
14692,1162976,"This is a real Vintage Port -  This is Niepoort! Vintage Port is only produced in the best years, 2007 was a really good Port-wine vintage Purple-(red) colour, nearly black Aromas of chocolate, dried herbs, spieces, amarena cherries and vanilla with an oaky touch On the palate complex and concentrated with still young tannins; really smooth with a touch of pepper and berries.  Long finish with a fruity aftertaste and hints of leather Lots of potential- wait another 5-10 years! That's a true Niepoort Port!"
14693,1162976,"1997 was a stellar port year. And it is showing in this beauty.  Wonderful subtle impressions of dried fruits, raisins, apricots. Some alcohol impressions too. On the palate very well integrated flavors of dried fruits, a hint of nuts too. Great balance and with just exact enough acidity. Very very good."
14694,1162976,"ECLECTIC JUICE  Looking for Port outside the mainstream? Enter Dirt Niepport, a Renaissance man with a slight aversion to tradition. From a 98 pt vintage, this bottle is packed with thick, chewy flavors!  Dense purple tumbling into the glass, it emits aromas of beautiful violet & blue fruits. Thick but delicate, the palate reveals flavors of blueberry, licorice & cherry cola with silky tannins and a light woody note, all coated in a soft leathery finish that goes on for minutes. Elegant! 93 pts"
14695,1162976,"Well balanced and a long length. Silky, full bodied with out feeling jammy or jelly. Nutty nose of candied almond. Light density for a port. Medium acidity. Notes of red cherry, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, raisin, leather. Well structured "
14696,1162976,"Finale of the tasting at Quinta de Nápoles in Douro. Vintage port can only age in barrels for 2yrs unlike tawny port, so the rest is about what happens in the bottle. Infinitely reasonably priced vs non-fortified wine.  Nose: reductive nose. Great oxidative mushroom contrasts with prune. Marshmallow finish.  Palate: nice tension between the sweetness of concentrated fig, quince+caramelised orange and an acidity that bites. Smooth tannins. This results in an overall elegant, lingering finish."
14697,1162976,"Wow, what an elegant sweet wine! Full of hazelnut, toffee and a certain je-ne-sais-quoi. Long lasting finish. 10x better than the 1978 we had 2 days later."
14698,1162976,My first Porto in magnum. Very impressive. 4.6
14699,1594682,"3.9 medium lemon. In nose: wax, minerals, honey,smoke, hay, lime, lemon, grapefruit. Really attractive. Smooth and palate coating. "
14700,1594682,"This wine needs food. Salted mango, lemon meringue, grapefruit, and melon nose. Medium full body. Medium high acidity. Salt, melon, kiwi, and petroleum. Complex and fun. 3.9⭐️"
14701,1594682,"Unique, local wine grown in sand dunes. Smells of yellow apples, apricots. Fresh wine and high acidity and goes well with fish, shrimps and sauce with wine and cream."
14702,1594682,"This was a very interesting wine and definitely needs food to fully enjoy. Comes in a 375mL bottle as well and is grown just outside of Lisbon where the salty sea air infuses the wine. Golden in color. Saline filled nose with hints of tropical fruit, mango, guava, and some green apple. Medium plus acidity, full of saline on the body. By itself, not something I would recommend but paired with equally salty food, I so recommend 3.7 stars. "
14703,1594682,60/100 @Yeatman Christmas wine experience 17
14704,1594682,"Hay and straw. Feels to young. Sea water, salty citrus. Confusing. Might need five more years???"
14705,1594682,Great versatile wine for price. Was impressed. Matched it with pasta chicken caulifower. Will buy again 
14706,1594682,"Very unique white, good for aging"
14707,1594682,"Fantastic wine. Brine , fruity, length, body and texture. Would buy a case!"
14708,1594682,Lovely buttery with a fresh bouquet.
14709,1594682,"Dry, very aromatic, saline, touch of age"
14710,1594682,A very special wine made in the wrong place: the west coast of Portugal. It is a mineral and salty wine. You notice some acidity but if you like the style this is a great achievement. Very low production so drink it fresh and savory it.
14711,1594682,"Wine number two (for some reason we are only allowed to taste 4 wines each, so have dropped the entry level which is described as unpretentious!).  Very different style 100% Malvasia from sandy soils. Stainless steel ferment and 6 months in old BrazilIan 🇧🇷 barrels.   White blossom, touch of minerality, salty austere long finish.   Great, more my style than the first wine.   "
14712,1594682,"Great example of bone dry Malvasia. Golden colour. Nose of wax, lemon, white flower. Salty, almost sherry like palette, lemon, olive, pink grapefruit. Great acidity and length. Very moreish and sold in 50cl bottle that leaves you wanting more 🥂"
14713,1594682,"Nose of dry hay and a bit of lime stone. Taste is interesting combination of unripe nectarine, clay like minerals, solid acidity of rhubarb with a spanky lime kick to it. Very interesting wine!"
14714,9602726,"Hot sunny summer afternoon snd a glass of this! Perfect pairing. Lemon, lime, green apple, salt. I quite enjoyed this glass. "
14715,9602726,"Lovely and great value - soft grassy note with a hint of oak richness on the nose. Herbaceous, soft lemon and chalky with a hint of salinity yet plenty of acidity. Really very nice. Good value too. "
14716,9602726,Dark yellow wine. Hinds of citrus pear minerals lychee grapefruit. Medium sweetness acidity body. Long finish. 
14717,9602726,Lovely creamy white
14718,9602726,"Nice and smooth, surprised"
14719,1954313,Color  Reminds me of the passion that I have for red fruits  Smell I would not prefer it  Taste a bit more acidic in the end   Nevertheless  It's a good wine which goes well with some proper snacks 
14720,1954313,So smooth and rich in blackberry and although dry leaves no dry feeling on the back of the tongue.  
14721,1954313,"Very nice nose, lots of red fruit. A little disappointed with the first sip. Mouth feel is a bit chalky. Decent smoking finish."
14722,1954313,"A up level from re winery , wood in the right level"
14723,1954313,Fruity and good value. Better with food 
14724,1954313,"Ótimo alentejano, sabores de cereja, Praliné, amadeirado, taninos médios, longo final.  Great alentejano, cherry flavour, wooded, Praliné, medium tannins and long ending."
14725,1954313,"Deep purple colour. Aromas of vanilla, blackberry, blueberry. High acidity, medium+ tannins, medium body. Flavours of blackberry, blackcurrant, cherry, vanilla, some black pepper notes. Medium finish."
14726,1954313, red fruit cherry vanilla
14727,1954313,"Young fresh (cheap) wine with a good balance. Excellent for the price (I paid 3,5€) but nothing you'll remember the day after. "
14728,1954313,"PH Rating 3,5"
14729,1954313,Continua honesto... Pronto!
14730,1954313,Followed this up a month later and still feel that it’s an underrated budget level wine. Don’t let the 3.2 scare you. At R$30-ish it’s a great deal. 
14731,1954313,"Good, lot lot of cherry!! Honest!"
14732,1954313,Acid and persistent taste 
14733,1954313,Excelente custo beneficio! 
14734,1984940,Cool but too strong
14735,1984940,"Young.  We double decanted.  Lots of nuances however spice, red fruit and velvet (alcohol) on the palate "
14736,1984940,Excellent fresh wine for hot summer days.
14737,1984940,"3,7. Brightly- chocolate, cherry in the chocolate, figs - matured, dried and jammed. A bit lacks acidity but with strong tannins"
14738,1984940,"Don't drink and drive! Wine is not the best choice. Not bad, not good..."
14739,1984940,"Herdade do Peso, garantido."
14740,1984940,Great One for the price if you like Spanish and Portuguese wine. 
14741,1984940,"Intensive gold colour, pronounced aroma of ripen tropical fruits. Full bodied, but still fresh in mouth. Long finish."
14742,1984940,Fresh apple and pear taste. Well balanced acidity. Perfect to drink either on it's own or with light dishes.
14743,1984940,"Clear gold colour. Complex fruit aromas. Off dry, fresh acidity with a medium body. Integrated stone fruit flavours. Well balanced with a long finish. A very nice wine. 16/20."
14744,1984940,Fair support for seafood.
14745,1984940,Intenso e volumoso
14746,1984940,"Last bottle brought from Portugal Really nice lots of fruity flavour and still some good bouquet. Very nice with entrecote roasted potatoes and carrots, bearnaisesås corn on the cob. Wish I had some more 😘"
14747,1984940,High in tannins with a light sweety touch. High in alcohol. Two glasses should be enough with a pepper steak.
14748,1984940,"Stone fruit nose with green apple, lemon, pear, and slight mineral notes. Pale in color with obvious green hues. Medium acidity, green apple, pear and melon body. Clean short finish. 3.7 stars."
14749,1427478,"Melon. Melon. Melon. Different for sure. Slight smoke, slight citrus, refreshing. Went well with goats cheese salad and gruyère too. I can see why some punters are thinking of Chardonnay when they drank this."
14750,1427478,"Wine produced with the Douro Tradicional castes Codega do Larinho, Viosinho, Rabigato, Gouveio and  Malvasia Fina. Clean lime green color. Citric aroma, with some floral notes. In the mouth is elegant and fresh, with grapefruit notes. Medium aftertaste."
14751,1427478,9.1.21 at Graham’s winery - oak with melon 
14752,1427478,Beautiful dry white wine that can be drank all too easily on its own. Taste of bacon fries and Smokey earthy notes. Love it!
14753,1427478,Beautiful white wine. Had in country Porto w/ seafood tapas. bon vhino butter honey melon apricot
14754,1427478,"Chardonnay like but less buttery very refreshing and full of flavour of Gallia melon,pinneaple and green apple with a hint of old wooden casks. Super!"
14755,1427478,"Bright golden hue, pineapple, honey, green melon, oily, crisp acidity, medium body "
14756,1427478,"Flinty dry, pineapple, long finish. Try with sardines from a tin. "
14757,1427478,Sweet. Great value for money!
14758,1427478,"Crisp, refreshing wine. "
14759,1427478,Delicious! Had it with Jenny at o gaveto with raw bar platter . Supa crisp

14762,1427478,Chardonnay like. Zesty. Refreshing. 2.5
14763,1427478,"Fresh, easy to drink and not one hundred percent dry. Which gives its own identity."
14764,2382093,Followed one Portuguese expert and was not disappointed. Fresh and crisp. Colour- pale yellow. Nose - green apple and pear. Taste more citrus with prevailing grapefruit 
14765,2382093,Super acidic up front. Very bright. Mineral. A sharp wine. Quick finish. Very good.
14766,2382093,"Beautiful! Grapefruit, green apple, unripe honeydew melon, bright but not sharp acidity. Implication of salinity and fizz. Really delightful. "
14767,2382093,Yup on point with those numbers 4.0. Lovely lovely Alvarinho from Portugale. Eet iz smoooth eef u ketch my drift. For a more pretentious description read someone else’s review. For me it suffices to say the pear bouquet just takes me away...although not too far since I’m in New York Quarantine state of mind.
14768,2382093,"My first Vino Verde ✔️  A small 4⭐️❓. Light floral nose and it tastes like something between Riesling and Grauburgunder with citrus and melon, light herbal and salty. Dry mouthfeel but a little fruit sweetness. Good lenght and acidity and the 13,5 % is well integrated and not noticeable.  Nice new wine type I’ll explore more..."
14769,2382093,Minerals and a little citrus. Very crisp and clean. Light almost pale yellow color. Would no doubt try again. Think I need to explore these vinho verde more.
14770,2382093,"very nice wine.  notes of fruit, butter and some oak.  Refreshing. Ate w fish at Taberna 8 - 80 in Nazaré, Portugal. would recommend. "
14771,2382093,"Taste of: grapefruit, apple and oak."

14775,2382093,Effervescent. Lemon. Grapefruit. Tart. 
14776,2382093,I love this wine! Everything you want from a young(ish) alvarinho. Bring on summer!
14777,2382093,"Citrus nose.  Grapefruit and minerals on the palate.  Dry, with notable acidity."
14778,2382093,"Surprising Alvarinho. Pale yellow, with nose of citrus and green almond. The body is almost thick, sticky with a funky, fizzy element that makes me think of Aligote, or rotten mushrooms and mold. Which are good things in my opinion. It went perfectly with my ginger, onion, nutmeg, sardines fresh pasta. "
14779,1105367,"Yum. Great winery. Great wine. I drink their reds but had forgotten how good the whites are. Butter, Honey, Vanilla - like a light fluffy cake made out of wine....."
14780,1105367,"Delicious but very powerful and intense white - not for all occasions or dishes. Notes of oak, butter and citrus on the nose and palet. Very nice wine 👌 "
14781,1105367,"Certainly one of my whites favorites from Portugal.  Medium yellow color, tropical fruits, vanilla and toast flavors, mineral on mouth, crisp acidity, long finish.  Paired with seafood BBQ.  Rate 4.3"
14782,1105367,"👀 pale lemon 👃  Lots of oak,roasted  hazelnut , butter , peach , almond , lemon. 👄 High flavour intensity, med + acidity, Full bodied ,  Very good wine , good balanced and great body "
14783,1105367,"(4.3) Esporāo did it again...exceeded my expectations. 100% Semillon,on the lees 6 months + oak aged 12 months.  Creamy approach, mouthfilling with toasty notes and rich ripen tropical notes. Persistent and full bodied throughout with layered taste, adding vanilla, toffee and citrus.  Beautiful never ending finish, not overwhelming.  "
14784,1105367,Amazing white! This is a classic. No question about it. Full of great minerality. Lemon zest. Citrus. Spices.
14785,1105367,"Wow. This one surprises me. Heavy style Southern Portugese white. Oak, tropical fruits, pineapple, some coconut. "
14786,1105367,Really great expression of Semillion! Would have guessed that there was some Antão Vas in the mix! Tropic thunder! 
14787,1105367,"What a nice Portuguese white!  Lovely tobacco impressions blended with apricot.   Med acidity, mild spicy with flavors of cedar and tobacco. Interesting wine. 15 pts @ wijnhandel Francoise"
14788,1105367,Buttery wine with hints of oak and peach. Very good and very classy! 
14789,1105367,"Most of us guessed wrongly. What a lovely Semillon white wine we tasted it. Citrus lemon peach floral, nice and great starter. "
14790,1105367,Excellent bold white with apricot and peach tones. 
14791,1105367,"Superb wine from this bodega. 100% semillion, that is quite rare. Deep colour, complex bouquet, some oak. Concentrated, smooth, fruity, minerally, dry. Very unexpected and interesting."
14792,1105367,"On the nose I get some pineapple, quite perfumed.  Long finish on taste, citrus, oak well integrated.  Nice white from Portugal.  Recommend"
14793,1105367,"4.9  again! A favorite  🤩.  Super fresh, deep and gresh with a pleasant complexity. This wine matches most of tu the best wines in Bourgogne. Oak vanilla and pleasant mature citrus. Good minerals fulfill the experience. "
14794,5425478,"Cheese on the nose. Grapefruit, lemon, round nose and palate. Medium bodied, complex, mineral and herbaceous long finish. "
14795,5425478,"Notes of Minerals , on a crisp wine"
14796,5425478,"Unique, mineral taste. Great with white fish. "
14797,5425478,"Ketonic aromas. Tangerines, satsumas, some oil. A few florals, and a bit of pepper. Interesting."
14798,5425478,Fantastic alentejo white This is a perfumed wine with beautiful aromas of tropical fruits; full bodied on the palate it displays rich notes of stone fruits and tropical fruits as well as white summer flowers and lime tree flowers; it has a high acidity and finishing dry with a long length
14799,5425478,"My kind of wine wine, delicate, fresh, very drinkable, especially when in the region itself! "
14800,5425478,"Very light, not strong and sweet "
14801,5425478,3.8. Nice minerality and notes of citrus. Quite light and great with grilled white fish
14802,5425478,This was a wonderful wine and was great with both Turkey and latterly grilled tuna. Very fragrant and with a curios mixture of sweet undertones and then a citrusy finish. Full bodied and I suspect very good with spicy food. Muito Groovy
14803,5425478,"From Portalegre, the most northerly sub-region of DOC Alentejo, this is a blend of old vine Arinto, Fernão Pires & Roupeiro, part aged in new French oak.  Pale lemon. Very fresh w. lemon, grapefruit, passionfruit & touches of toasted sesame & hazelnut. Lime peel & orange blossom, peach stone & light vanillin. Youthful.  Dry. Very zesty w. high acid, med alc, creamy hazelnut & almond. Lemon, baked lime, grapefruit & very delicate vanilla to a med+ finish. Both refreshing & interesting. Decent value."
14804,5425478,"Chalky aromatic nose, palate has some gin-type sourness.  Sharp finish. Medium body,  I even feel some tannins!"
14805,5425478,"Old vines field blend of Arinto, Fernao Pires, Roupeiro and twelve others (!), from the Alentejo. The height of the vineyards shields them from excessive summer heat. 3000 bottles a year. Matured in part on new oak, but not excessively woody. A very refined, elegant wine. Rather shy nose, some aniseed / wormwood. Super smooth texture, and a very clean but complex taste. Cream, oak notes and minerals are complemented by herbs and, finally, some citrus and a saline finish. Jancis Robinson 16.5.  (Saterdagh)"
14806,5425478,Never tasted banana in a wine but this was fantastic. Also some lemon and a lick of oak
14807,5425478,A good solid white. Tastefull and fresh. Should be served cold. 3.7 points.                              Cheers my friends.
14808,5425478,Grape : Arinto based wine. Expect more strong Character but weak fruity flavor and minerals. Good for pairing with seafoods.
14809,1165304,"👁 Deep Ruby   👃🏻 medium(+)/pronounced intensity.  Aromas of cooked red cherry, cooked red plum, blackberry, black plum, cinnamon & licorice spice, fig, raisins, dried flowers.  👅 sweet, m(+) acid, medium(+) tannin (fine, chalky), high alcohol, full body, pronounced flavour intensity. Long finish.  Dense, concentrated, rich and big, this is an outstanding wine, beautifully integrated and complex, with a wonderful balance and lovely length."
14810,1165304,"Tasted the day of the declaration, 2012 a great vintage for Noval, already so drinking friendly and elegant, and as Christian Seely told us this day “My approach to this is very simple: if we feel that we have a wine of the necessary quality, and with the style and character of a classic Quinta do Noval Vintage, we will declare it, even if this means declaring two years in a row (as we did in '07 and '08, and indeed in '03 and '04,) and even if it means bottling only a very small amount of Vintage Port."""
14811,1165304,"A dry growing season. Elder berries and barks, slightly vegetal nose. Split palate, a lot of alcohol and sugar, tannins are a bit green."
14812,1165304,Cassis and pure. Very heavy on the pallet. Surely one the greats. Needs another xxx years. Can't go wrong with this
14813,1165304,This wine has great potential although is much too young now. 
14814,1165304,Nice port. Sweetness to it.  Thicker and dark color. No real spiciness to it which I miss. 
14815,1165304,"The best of three 2015 vintage ports tasted in February. These recently bottled wines were all delightfully fruity and approachable, it would be no crime to open a bottle now. Typically for the vintage this Noval has a wonderfully floral nose. Abundant blackcurrant and black cherry fruit. The palate is dense and warm, spicier than the others tasted. Excellent fruit, grippy tannins, neither the sweetness or acidity too excessive at this age. Delicious now, and a great prospect."
14816,1165304,"Wow! 60% Touriga Nacional, 30% TF, 10% TC. 5,000 cases were made.  ""Iron fist in a velvet glove"" Very complex and interesting. Pure - violets, floral, cherry, red berries, nettles, mint, blackcurrant, cranberry, wet stone, mineral, blueberry. Amazing concentration of fruit, powerful yet fresh. The balance here is amazing: alcohol, sugar, or tannins don't stick out. This is deliciously "
14817,1165304,"There is potential here! Still young, but already great! The tannins are still a bit rough but will well develop with time. Not too much sweetness and good acidity. Great finish that will become a 5/5 in few years in my opinion! Cheers 🍷"
14818,1165304,"One of the best young Port’s I have ever tasted. So rich, lovely blackberries and lots of tannins. Beautiful wine. And will last for the next 40-50 years. 🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷"
14819,1165304,"Wait! This wine will be brilliant, but only if we wait...opening bottles of this now can be equated with nothing less than oenological infanticide. Wait!"
14820,1165304,"Ok, pretty much impossible to swallow at this stage, but what a wine this will be. Just wow"
14821,1165304,"This beautifully perfumed wine has all the tannins that will allow it to age gracefully over many decades. It offers rich wild berries, dark plum skin, orange blossom,licorice and dried lavender - infused blueberries and great structure that will support that aging. A mineral undertow accentuates the elegance. Surprisingly brooding, with an cocoa- powder lifted finale and a pleasant freshness on the aftertaste!  "
14822,1165304,"TOP DOG PORT  Very young at this moment! Great nose with blackberries, figs, spice, tar, smoke, on the palate the alcohol is still present, licorice notes with plum and dark chocolate, a touch of cedar, round, creamy, long finsh... You must be patience with this....at least 10+ years but probeley two more decades! "
14823,1165304,"Wine is clear, brightness is day bright, deep purple color, edge is deep pink color, no gas, no sediment, viscosity is high. Aroma is clean, cassis, black berry, black current, milk chocolate, cocoa, almond, leather, vanilla aroma. Sweet, medium + body, medium + acidity, medium tannin, medium alcohol, long finish, complexity is moderate +."
14824,1424778,"This is a fabulous wine! It's bold, with a deep colour and seductively intense. Soft tannins with a velvet touch, it has legs for days. Beautiful dark fruit on the mouth, feels plump and ripe. A delightful finish with some oak. Gorgeous Douro red!"
14825,1424778,"Very good Douro. Nice strong and powerful. Good nose of oak and dark fruit. Full bodied, complex and tastes of vanilla oak, little pepper, plum, blackberry and dark cherry. Good combination with Lamb from Texel. "
14826,1424778,"Beautiful, rich color and a robust, dark flavor that is a mix of blackberry, spice and minerality, with a finish containing a hint of citrus.  Overall an excellent wine that went well with a good, barbecued steak and hot side dish of lentils and mixed vegetables.  A great counterbalance to the mid autumn evening chill."
14827,1424778,"4,2⭐It was about time to have another Douro red.😀 Let it breathe ~1h. 👀Deep ruby. Abundant and slow tears. 👃Intense and elegant with blackberry, plum, ripe cherry, oak and a hint of leather. 👅Balanced, full bodied and really dry. Medium acidity. Vivid but well integrated tannins. 🏁Medium finish, shows a bit of astringency, black fruit and smoke in the aftertaste. 🗒️Really good Douro, believe it can still grow a bit in the cellar (has been there for over 1 year now). Ending tonight nicely.😃"
14828,1424778,Good full bodied red wine with lots of black fruits and ripe tanins. A little high on acids but definitely not unpleasant. 
14829,1424778,A superb wine with legs longer than the month of March. Gorgeous dark plum colour and dark fruit flavours. 
14830,1424778,"Nice concentration of black fruit and blueberry jam notes, hints of leather too, burnt wood. But quite flat finish, doesn't bring much new notes. Still, an interesting wine."
14831,1424778,Loved the cherry and coaco on this  great wine.
14832,1424778,I love this region. Nice and fruity and smooth. 
14833,1424778,Very fruity and tannic. Will get better with age.

14860,1888387,This is a really nice complex red even though it is a bit unbalanced with almost a hint of bitterness underneath the tannins. It will probably come together in a few years time. 
14861,1888387,Delicious play between minerality oak and acidity. 
14862,1888387,Similar to the 2012 I rated.

14867,1888387,"Dark yellow color with fresh and minerals aroma. In the palate a big explosion of minerals found solely to this marvelous variety ENCRUZADO (only found in Dão region ... I think so) with hints of ripe fruit (lemon and grapefruit). Amazing structure in the mouth, balanced, pretty nice acidity and very, very long finish. You have to believe me and until then I invite everybody to check how beautiful grow in the bottle. Great Wine by Carlos Lucas and ""The Team""."
14868,1888387,Good balanced with nice minerals and fruit. Some fine oak-tunes. 
14869,1888387,Just a wonderful fresh and oaky aromawith a hint of pears. Very elegant and I really like it. 
14870,1888387,"Wow, this one got in my top 5 white wines! Incredible freshness and minerality for 8-years old wine, big aromas of citrus and ripe fruits, with hints of grass and almond! Soft oily structure, high acidity, long beautiful aftertaste! A real treat!"
14871,1888387,"Pear, butter scotch, honey. Round minerals. It holds a nice finish, long and flavorful. Have no doubt about it. It has class. Old Europe."
14872,1179680,"Delicious vintage port from Sandeman. Dark red color, ripe berries on the palate, lots of power and sweetness. An excellent dessert wine. "
14873,1179680,The bottle says it was supposed to last 12 years max and yet I drank it 18 years later and I found it to be more than very good really enjoyed it
14874,1179680,"Cranberry, raspberry, raisin, and almond nose. Raisin, walnut, almond, vanilla, chocolate covered raspberry. Smooth and silky - delicious vintage! 4.6⭐️  Single Quinta Vintage Port - the entire region wasn’t good enough for a vintage but this Quinta (vineyard) was. "
14875,1179680,"It is recommended to start drinking vintage port from this vineyard approximately ten years after bottle to reach best taste. Garnet in color with a brownish rim. Slight sediment in the glass.  Caramel, dried cherries, raisins, figs, raspberry. Medium acidity, smooth body of red fruit, vanilla and chocolate. 4.3 stars"
14876,1179680,"This was actually a 1999 Vintage that was bottled in 2001.  It was a half bottle that I got for 20 bucks.  The cork crumbled, and I had a hard time getting out all the little bits.  But the wine was excellent.  It's smooth and rich, sweet and spicy."
14877,1179680,"The name sounds like a pun. Read in Portuguese, it sounds like “it is worth a Vintage”. This suggests that it does not meet all the conditions of the origin denomination, but the label and the official seal indicates it is a real Vintage Port. I cannot find anymore how much I paid for the case I bought around 2003, but I remember I thought it was too cheap to be a real Vintage Port. The quality corresponds to a good one: dark chocolate, dense blackberries and some nuts. "
14878,1179680,"88/100 points. Dark garnet with intense nose. So full bodied it almost stays in the bottle. Surprisingly light and creamy on the palate. Serve at 18-20 degrees Celsius with caramel, dried figs of blue cheese. Drink within one to two hours. OK value at DKK 239."
14879,1179680,"An incredible bargain for a vintage port: $35 for 1999 blew my mind. And it was a fantastic wine, though not of the pedigree of Taylor's or Graham's.  Only just showing some garnet reflections, this still has a core of red cherry and plums, with rich spices of cinnamon, pepper, toffee, caramel and mocha. Vintage Port is known for its long aging potential and this is no exception: another 20 years and this will still be singing despite being in a good place right now. Cheers!"
14880,1179680,"An entirely different vintage port from Sandeman's Quinta do Seixo 2017 in the next glass. Relatively light and savoury, relatively complex and elegant. Dried cherry, strawberry, fig, citrus peel, leather, tobacco, undergrowth, chocolate.  Soft, supple and nicely balanced on the palate. I seem to get on well with Sandeman's ports. Although this Vau Vintage second label is forward for a vintage port, it should be good for another 10 years. Tasted at Decanter Fine Wine Encounter."
14881,1179680,"Very rich on the nose, cocoa, molasses, walnut, balsamic, vanilla. Long finish with a great after taste. Fantastic!"
14882,1179680,Delicate vintage ruby; earthy nose; pleasant; tasted at the cellar

14885,1179680,Delicious. Had this in the tasting rooms in the Instituto do Vinho do Porto. The nose is incredible and lingers slightly in the palate whilst being really smooth.
14886,1179680,"A great XX century Porto. Deep ruby, ruby rims. Slow-slow legs. Raspberries, strawberries, chocolate, sweet cherries aromas. Caramel, prunes, dark chocolate on palate. Long-long aftertaste."

14890,8492810,"Supermarket series, the last one from the weekend, didn’t have time to taste this one. The best for last, maybe 😂 👃 a subtle nose, doesn’t reveal much, maybe a bit dull for my taste. Tropical with some citrus and minerals. A touch of fig and mango at the end.  🍷 vivid contrary to the nose, light bodied, low acidity, perfect to drink without food. A modest aftertaste. "
14891,8492810,Fruity and delicious taste

14895,2351986,"Second of two white wines tasted during the evening in Lisbon. Much more better than first one. Light-straw colour in the glass with delicate green hints. On the nose palette of fresh citrus fruits. What a smell!!! In the mouth lot of fruits of citrus, peach, lime, grapefruit, lemon, melon, pear, green apple with very delicate herbs. I still can bring the taste in my mind. That was very interesting mix of fresh citrus fruits and herbs. At the finish minerals. I am sure I will try one more bottle of this 🥂"
14896,2351986,"Very fresh and ethereal aromatic wine,  a bright straw-lemon color with green nuances. Nose: fruity freshly citrus, fresh green herbs, white flowers and minerals. In the mouth: fresh acidic citrus, peaches, pears, green melons, yellow apples, mild spices, and delicate herbs. Wine nice fresh, light and juicy. With mineral aftertaste."

14912,1228856,"Baga! By definition needs many more years of aging....but this one was very good and has a bright future. Super dry, leathery and the first time I honestly sensed some pencil shavings. But please age. You need the maturity. Saúde!"

14916,1228856,Interesting mature Baga from Bairrada. Aged in used 300l barrels for 12 months & has developed leathery notes with a touch of red fruit remaining. On the palate tannins have softened with good acidity on the finish but lacking a bit of depth.
14917,1228856,First try of the baga grape. Probably a bit too young to do it justice 
14918,1228856,Baga! Interesting wine: like a Pinot meets spiciness of a Syrah. Great!

14926,1180697,Drank this after an aged SA wine. An interesting blend with some Syrah i. There. You can really taste red fruit and toasted vanilla. French oak I believe. Easy drinker and a firm favourite in our house. 4.0 
14927,1180697, oak cherry vanilla blackberry
14928,1180697,"Good flavors and aromas of fruit ( black fruit and red fruit) and lots of exotic yeast notes. Ruby / violet color. Full-bodied, medium dry. In terms of smell and taste, it is a pleasant red from Alentejo region, for those who enjoy yeasty wine  (which is not my case).         Contains sulphites. 14,5.º alcohol. "
14929,1180697,Acidic and dry. Hints of ripe fruit all around. A cranberry note finish. 
14930,1180697,"Reliable, smooth, medium length, fruitful finish"
14931,1180697,"Dry, needs an hour or so to open up."
14932,1180697,Good value for money Barrique enhances wine value
14933,1180697,Weak ... bland and no finish 
14934,1180697,"Powerful, intense but also fresh and complex. Very interesting, you can almost chew it. "
14935,1180697,Totally delicious. Tastes like a great Rioja. Buy!
14936,1180697,Smooth and young
14937,1180697,Magic rustique smell!
14938,1180697,"Extremely good. Very well structured with ink dark colour, nose of earth and spices and palate of cherries, chocolate and caramel."
14939,1223599,Light and. Fruity 
14940,1223599,Another example of how Portuguese wines ate wonderful at such low prices.  Approachable with great body and fruit this wine is delightful.
14941,1223599,Drank this wine in Portugal in the area of its production. May be hard to find outside this region but if you can it has a good balance of fruit and acidity. 
14942,1223599,I simply love these Portuguese ref wines. Especially from Alentejo.
14943,1223599,"Smooth taste of ripe berries, light spices and some wood. Light bold palate."
14944,1223599,"Absolutely stunning..refined and elegant,"
14945,1223599,"Nice full body, leather and oak. Not much length but would drink it again. "
14946,1223599,"Very interesting base note slightly hard to describe other than herbal.  Full bodied so it carries it fine, but too peculiar for regular consumption.  "
14947,1223599,Had in coimbra with my beautiful partner. Hope de cod will be as good. 
14948,1223599,"Very nice, sweet and flowery."
14949,1223599,"Great wine, good value for money."
14950,1223599,Alentejano curious wine. Reddish purple colors. Aromas of moist red fruit. Taste is a stick on front mouth at start with smoky light vanilla and spices holding in the end. Aftertaste is pretty pleasant. Alentejano wines are always interesting finds. Good.
14951,1223599,"Wonderful bouquet. Red and brown tones. There's something here, yet, its grapefruit thing in the mouth just doesn't kick with me. In essence, I can't make my mind up if I love it or hate it. :) nSo, my recommendation is to maybe avoid this wine if you're not an adventurer."
14952,1223599,Had in Porto - with a lovely date ♥️
14953,1223599,Nice Portuguese wine. Good with a steak. 
14954,1172847,"93 Aroma had raisins, prunes, sweet dates, prunes and vanilla. Over the palate came candied black currrants, raisins, vanilla, cocoa, prunes and coffee. Medium acidity, low tanins and sweet."
14955,1172847,"Dark ruby in colour. Prunes, leather, figs, dates, dark chocolate, raisins, vanilla, and plums in the aroma. Flavour of cherries, caramel, vanilla fudge, plums, chocolate, and raisins. 93."
14956,1172847,Great port wine:-)
14957,1172847,No notes taken.
14958,1172847,"Dark red fruit, wood and hay. Very good.  Dark red fruit on the palate with notes of cherry, plum, wood, vanilla, figs and spices. Really dark and deep. Notable tannin. Very fresh & vibrant. Can be stored years more. 93"
14959,1172847,Classic vintage port that taste very young despite being almost 20 years old. Very intense fruit and plenty of tannins. Good value. 
14960,1172847,Very good. Lots of fruits. Some leather. Some Cherry. Some plums. Some pear in finish.
14961,1172847,91p.  blackcurrant raisin and fruits. Wonderful balance - not too much. 
14962,1172847,"A very good port. Not sticky or too sweet, with lots of layers of flavour — chocolate, vanilla, hint of tobacco. Really nice!"
14963,1172847,"This 1997 is much better than 2000... long aftertaste, less sweet, not so strong"
14964,1172847,"Dark red with purple hints. Fruity and intense, ripe fruits, raspberries, plums als spiceness. In mouth very complex, sweet, concentrated wine with long finish "
14965,1172847,"Soft, deep red and sweet with a nice initial alcohol hint which turns into sweet dark fruit (plum and raisin), caramel and a bit of vanilla. The Old Pharmacy wine bar in Lisbon’s barrio alta area seemed like a perfect place to taste this"
14966,1172847,"Eye: Deep ruby colour. Nose: Moist oak. Red honey. Mouth: A perfect harmony of sweetness, power, roundness & alcohol.  This wine is just getting better and better every time I open it. So good."
14967,1172847,"Deep ruby color, intense, expressive and elegant notes of ripe black fruit like blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and lovely aromas of eucalyptus and menthol mixed with tobacco leaves, dried herbs, fig, prunes, vanilla and cigar box. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. Balanced, vibrant acidity and long luxurious finish."
14968,1172847,"Color is deep, almost black. The nose is young, a bit medical and firm. The taste is dense, strong, balanced and with great promise. It is good now, but will improve in the coming 10-15 years. But nice to drink now!"
14969,5986042,"100% Baga from Douro. Deep ruby red colour with violet rim. Complex nose with pronounced aromas of ripe blackcurrants, blackberries, plum, herbaceous, vanilla and oak. Dry with full-bodied and rounded well integrated tannins. In the mouth explodes aromas of ripe black fruits and licorice. Very long and overwhelming finish. Cigar  box and spices. Well structured with firm tannins, full bodied, balanced, good acidity and long seductive finish. "
14970,5986042,"91/100 From a mini vertical tasting, this was my favorite of all four (2014-2017). Single vineyard red wine made from the grape Baga and aged in big oak for 16 months. This smells like true Baga. Notes of brambleberry, raspberry, perfume, and rosemary notes. This is medium bodied with high acidity and tough tannins. Very enjoyable and should develop nicely in the bottle. "
14971,5986042,"Garnet, ripe strawberry, earthy aromas. Dry, high tannins, long after taste turning to ripe plum. "
14972,5986042,It's not all about baga. It's about something else. Fresh nose with red berries. Fruit in the palate and loads of elegance 
14973,5986042,"Really nice, some raspberries and licorice. High acids, really elegant, beautiful wine!"

14976,5986042,"Liquorish, very light woods,  berries."
14977,5986042,"[Portugal Collection tasting] Complex nose with cinnamon, red fruit and sweet prunes. The fresh palate sports mint and a nice acidity/tannines balance. Not the best QPR... 3.4"
14978,5986042,"A nice perfumed nose with roses and violets, fruit comes from cherries. Again, that typical fresh Douro breeze on the palate and with a meaty mouthfeel. Good but a bit pricey..."
14979,5986042,Very interesting expression of Baga. Great to pair with some saucy food.
14980,5986042,Robust but not heavy
14981,5986042,"Very original wine from the unique Baga grape, a lighter but extremely aromatic variety, with red cherry and raspberry notes, on the palate light bodied with sweet and medium tannins. Medium finish. Pairs well with red and white meet."
14982,5986042,"This is a really good wine, in classic strict style. Some slight raisins and black pepper telling the Douro origin. Well integrated oak, good balance and silky but prominent tannins. Still very young, I would store this another three to five years. Impressive!"
14983,5986042,"Great and Unique Baga from granite soil in the Douro, intense but fresh and elegant, only 12 % but with nice tannins, paired perfectly with a Christmas Turkey "
14984,76431,"Wow, what a QPR thia delivers... dense garnet color, sweet nose, toasted oak, chocolate, blackberry, cassis. As Smooth as they come. Great"
14985,76431,"So good, super balanced and soo incredibly smooth. You CANNOT beat this price for the quality.   We enjoyed this for our 4 year anniversary "
14986,76431,"Vintage 2016. Velvety with blackberry and cherry flavors.  Aftertaste of cassis.  Tasted with cod pie.  Grad.  14, practically imperceptible.  Exceptional."
14987,76431,Very nice! Deep rich burgundy color with great aromas of chocolate and cherry.  Moderate to full body with medium to heavy tannins.  Leathery and lively with blackberry and apple spice
14988,76431,"Wow! Great wine, beautiful on the nose and on the palate even better. Well balanced with a great smooth lingering finish. Vanilla, oak, leather, cherry, dark fruit simply great!"
14989,76431,"(4.5) 2016 vintage of this beautiful Alantejo blend, oak aged 12 months, Aragonez driven.  More dry with less body than 2015, has bags of black fruit, minerals and still juvenile tannins.  Dry approach with flavours of blackberry, black cherry and vanilla oak. Dry on the palate with firm young tannins and integrated acidity.  Very persistent and complex wine."

14993,76431,"Cartuxa wines will rarely disappoint you. This red is blend of Alicante Boushet, Aragonez (Tempranillo) and Trincadeira, the last two two being widely planted grapes in the Portuguese Alentejo region. This wine spent 12 months in french oak barrels. It is dry, bold and smooth, with well integrated tannins. Well balanced aromas of oak, plum, chocolate, cassis... extremely elegant and enjoyable. Cheers!"
14994,76431,"Bomb! Man what a juice! Inviting nose of cherry, blueberry, menthol and oak, then a beautiful palate of chocolate, buttery vanilla, some green pepper, spice, a bold and resilient acidity with a creamy finish. For 32 bucks it’s an overachiever. Mind you it’s “only” a “Colheita”. Kick ass red!"
14995,76431,"Excellent red wine  from Portugal, from Alentejo, a deep red-purple color with cherry reflexes. Nose: ripe, sweet, red fruit, green herbs, vanilla, dark chocolate and oak.

14999,1223379,"Dark, rich berries and spices to nose. Quite complex taste with medium tanins. Ready to drink now. Better accompalied by meal."
15000,1223379,"🎯 92/100 pts 4.3 ⭐️  👍🏼 My best 🇵🇹 red so far this summer. Awesome and stunning wine.  🍇  Alicante Bouchets and Trincadeira  🕰 24 months ageing in Moreau oak barrels and 10 years in bottle before sale release.  🎨 Dark garnet color with clear brick and orange edge  👃🏼 Delicious fragrance of dark berries, blueberries, plums, intence aromas of coffe and chocolate with soft hints of spices and herbs.  ⤵️ continue in comments..."
15001,1223379,"This wine is from Portugal, despite Vivino shows from France! Ripe and full-bodied, with an exotic flavor profile. Creamy and lush, with plenty of mocha, raspberry and cocoa flavors and hints of mango. Structured, with a tight finish of smoke and Asian spice.  "
15002,1223379,Incredible tannins.  Leather and dark fruit.  Lasts an eternity in the mouth.  Save your last bottle... This one's still got much life ahead.
15003,1223379,"Gloria Reynolds- Art and Tradition 2005. Medium + at the nose, enbodied, lengthy end of mouth, and with sediment. Nose 3,9/5 Mouth 4,3/5 Color and Tear 4/5 End of Mouth 4,2/5"
15004,1223379,Amazing. Complex and intense nose. Fruit and tertiary aromas. Full bodied. Very well balanced. It confirms something I often noticed : Portuguese wines are wonderful.
15005,1223379,Portugal wine made by British winemaker. Powerful and taste distinctively different from the usual red grape varietals. Found out that the grape varietals are aligante and treibache. Interesting taste of ribena with fragrant pine and spicy tones.
15006,1223379,Spices and wood
15007,1223379,"Quite a mouthful, almost seems like syrup. Very fruity, slight bitterness. Some spice on the finish."
15008,1223379,Well aged snd most enjoyable. 
15009,1223379,"A big wine - powerful, finishing long - I think this has many more years in it."
15010,1223379,Very round and perfect equilibrium in the mouth.decanted for one hour and enjoyed it.definitely the best alentejo wine I have ever tried.
15011,1223379,"Awesome blossom! Fantastic nose, rich in dried red fruit, cardamon, cinnamon, leather, wood, and much much more. Very long and tanniny - just like an old great Bordeaux. Very very rich - something you would expect from a New World wine rather than anything from the old world. "
15012,1223379,"Chocolate ,very good!!!"
15013,1223379,Some sophistication on the blends of merlot and CS with some nuances in the finish
15014,1182177,"Deep garnet. Smokey dark fruits and vanilla-y aromas in the nose. Round and polished velvety palate with mostly dark fruits, creme de cassis, licorice, boysenberry, blackberry, restrained, thick and substantive, lots of innate power contained within, subtle yet very long finish"
15015,1182177,"Great Douro red. Full body with round taninns. Long finish and chocolate, blueberries and licorice aromas"
15016,1182177,Touriga at his best
15017,1182177,"WoW! I wouldn’t have said this one is only 5 years old. As classic douro as it gets. Massive wine. Really dense, black fruits very present in the nose and on the mouth. It’s very silky and smooth. It’s awesome from start to finish. For the price, it’s better value than other wines produced in this part of the Douro region. Chances are it will get better in just a few years, but drinks beautifully now. "
15018,1182177,Pairing : Cheek of iberian pork in a red wine sauce
15019,1182177,"Amazing wine, definitely recommend!!"
15020,1182177,"An outstanding portuguese Douro wine! Limpid and vivid red color with violet notes. Complex and ellegant nose opening with blackberries, raspberries and subtile plum, passing through tobacco and coffee to end in spices, oak and mushrooms. In mouth, powerfull with ripe tannins. Almost chewable. Ellegant mature red fruits and spices flavors. Long and persistant with fine and pleasant aftertaste. One of the best Douro wines I ever drunk. Cheers!"
15021,1182177,"This is a star of Douro wines. Medium intense ruby color, aromas of ripe black cherries, bit of spring senses, tobacco and black pepper. It's amazing flavours of dark fruit, blackberries, ripe to overripe black cherries, dried prunes and a suport of vanilla. Tannins quite ripe and smooth and round but long acidity. And an endless aftertaste... What a great wine... Drink now or keep it for some time, as a friend of mine would say, Thunderstrocke!!! A MUST..."
15022,1182177,"Beautiful colour, dark, intense with lighter ruby edges.  Red and black berries, smoke, spices, oak/nut, bush, flowers, strong and beautiful nose. Great acidity, integrated but present wood,  present tannins and long finale. Will age beautifully. Still quite young from 2014 and bottled in Sept. 2016.  (4,2)"
15023,1182177,"Excelente. Muito vigoroso. Ainda está longe de seu ápice. Encorpado. Taninos firmes. Bouquet complexo. Mirtilo, chocolate, cassis. Body: 17; Tannins:18; Bouquet: 17; Nose: 17; Mouth: 18; Price: 16. Rating: 17,2/20"
15024,1182177,"Maybe not a 4.5 but close. This is a big-sized, full-bodied red with deep dark cherry, black fruit, earth, leather, oak, and some vanilla. This is a steak and grilled meats wine, great with grilled or roasted veggies. "
15025,1182177,"Excellent Douro red! This varietal of Tinta Roriz (called Tempranillo in Spain) is a complex and elegant wine with good depth and medium length, very easy to drink. Beautiful violet color, slightly floral, ripe red fruit, wild berries, chocolate, vanilla and a few herbaceous notes. Full bodied with polished tannins and a medium finish. A great red!"

15028,1182177,Excellent wine! Full bodied!!! Worth it!
15029,4733432,"Amazing, red fruit, cherry, plum, dried roses. Loved this.    **** checking back after having it again I realize this was supposed to be for the 2018 vintage."
15030,4733432,"Fruity, fresh, young and seems lighter than the 13.5% it clocks in at. Kind of reminds me of Gamay. Lots of red berries on the nose and body. Better on day 2 than day 1."
15031,4733432,"(3.8) Lovely fruit on the attack, slightly effervescent and actually reminiscent of genuine Cola. A bit short finish so this is a drink-now kind of bottle. "
15032,4733432,"Red unoaked wine is a quite new very interesting experience for me. The fruity flavors that are revealed in this Portuguese red wine is amazing. On the nose there is a lot of red fruits, black currant and rose hip. And the palate has even some wild strawberry and some pomegranate. Very refreshing and well worth spending. "
15033,4733432,"Maybe not a full 4, but definately better than 3.5 :)   An unoaked wine definately driven by its fruits. Lots of fruit.  A dark red color, with strong aromas from Blackcurrant and Blackberry, but also from Red currant and a huntvof Plum. Special with no oaky notes, low tannins and low acidity. Lots of fruit also on the palete, very nice with mild cheese and cold cuts."
15034,4733432,"Deep ruby in color with a developing medium plus intensity nose. Violets, red cherry, red raspberry, leather, red licorice, red plum. Dry, high acidity, medium plus tannins, medium intensity and medium alcohol. Red cherry, red plum leather, savory, jam. Very good quality of wine. Can drink now, suitable for further aging.   Aged 3 months in tank without oak."

Clean med+ intensity nose of violet, raspberry, red cherry, red licorice and leather.  Dry, med body, high zippy acidity, med alcohol and med- tannins. Med intensity flavors of raspberry, red cherry and leather on the palate leading to a med+ length finish.   Very good. A great example of the top quality and great value wines to be found in Portugal!"
15036,4733432,"3.9 Thanks to @[1|16425004|Vita in Vinum] advice, I got this beautiful unoaked Touriga. Very fresh in its inky and spicy dress.  Violets in a moist dirt field, blueberries & tea,  cough syrup, balsamic tones, sweet spices, licorice and hints of mint.  It has a mineral acidity with an almost chalky finish, much more austere than the fruit shown in the nose. Very interesting wine, better slightly chilled. Iberuly #22 🇵🇹"
15037,4733432,"Wow. Meant to drink young, think of it as a richer bodied ""Beaujolais Nouveau of Portugal"", this Alentejo unoaked fruity red is just a pleasure to drink. Rated for what it is, I just had to give it a 4. Highly recommended for a party or conversational red, but also good with food."
15038,4733432,4.0 A very nice wine from portugal! Portugal is such  underrated  wine country.  Its very fruity with nice mild aciditt that blends incredibly with the flavours in the mouth and ends on a tannic welcoming note.   Here i get pepper blackberries  blueberries  and off course earthy notes. Some subtle violet and dried herbs maybe some mint and licorice as well.  Its an fantadtic wine after airation. After you tried wino verde the treasure of portugal you got to try this! Nice! Priceworthy 🇵🇹 
15039,4733432,A Wine with much primary aromas blackberry and raspberry. A modern portugese wine. If you like intensive fruity wines this wine is for you. Paint with grilled meats.
15040,4733432,"New vintage still great. I this resembles of very light port, so me like!  blueberry blackberry earthy jam plum minerals"
15041,4733432,"In nose floral and cinnamon. In mouth black berries, plum jam, licorice. Enbodied but some sweetness. "
15042,4733432,"Blackberry, plum and blueberry flavours. Smooth. I think this would have been even better served cooler."
15043,4733432,"Youthful and fun company. Intense blueberries, plum and licorice with pepper finish. Frizzy - juicy - friendly! 3.8 P."
15044,1179372,"Classic but not my favorite, as it feels a bit unbalanced "
15045,1179372,"Dark ruby colour with yellow edges. It has touches of plum and dark fruits. It leaves a perfect aftertaste. Only negative,it contains too much alcohol "
15046,1179372,"Unfiltered late bottled vintage. Lighter garnet colour, aged. Intense aromas and even more intense on the palate: floral notes (violet), cherry jam, herbs, chocolate and spices. Sweet but not syrupy, enough acidity and, of course, an alcohol sensation on the palate, with a finish which just lasts and lasts. Lovely."
15047,1179372,"When in Portugal, drink vintage port.  This one is unique because the producers have ceased to continue the tradition.   Purchased in Carvoeiro, my expectations were high. This didn't disappoint,  wonderful crimson heart with a golden yellow, rust colored halo surrounding.  The nose is big.  Butter, caramel and tree nuts. Nice aftertaste "
15048,1179372,"A powerful porto. Bright red color with pale rim, very forward on nose, red fruit, sweet spicy, coco, nut, lot of tannin, and very long finish."
15049,1179372,A little rough edges. Alcohol shows too much both nose and mouth. But still nice to drink.
15050,1179372,"Bright ruby color. A bit too much alcohol at the beginning. It needed some breathing. Red fruit, dried figs, cinnamon, spices on the nose. Medium acidity, medium plus tannins, a bit sweet. Good value for a wine bought at this age. It is a good port but not exceptional."
15051,1179372,"Unfiltered 1999 vintage. Sweet, smooth nose. Nice sweetness and prunes in the mouth. Bit alcohol but not to sweet."
15052,1179372,Loved it. Smooth and full flavored but not too sweet or overbearing.
15053,1179372,A good glass of well preserved port
15054,1179372,"Wishlisted #11  What a great tradition to close our tasting with Port. This one was found by Fred and does have 20y of age! More than a good average.   The nose is quite typical Port with ripe dried fruits & spices in the nose. The palate has nice dried fruits (abricot, figs), the typical nuts, wood & spices. Very wall balanced, limited acidity, medium bodied and perhaps a tad too sweet. Good value for money.  Thanks @Frederic Knockaert  Ratef 3,8⭐️"
15055,1179372,"[Vivino Leuven 11/11] Time for the customary Port to wrap things up. I’m responsible for this one and while it had merit, I did expect more. Sweet and spicy nose with black prune and alcoholic fumes followed by an equally spicy and heartwarming palate with black fruit and integrated tannines but missing a bit of acidity and slightly too sweet. 3.6"
15056,1179372,"A good evolution towards nuts, dried apricots and figs. Even with the sweet approach this is a dangerously drinkable!"
15057,1179372,"Love it 🍷, great vintage port from 2000. Great"
15058,1179372,"Wonderfull dessert wine with richness and great character , but a strong alcoholic concentration. It needs decanning and has a very dark garnet , mudy texture. Its aromas are herbal reminding of basil and dark fruits like plum and black currant. Its body is medium with a mudy dense and mineral texture with full tannins being really gentle. Dominating flavors are plum and fig with herbal touches and intese currant aftertaste. Its really refreshing and leaves a mouthfull of black fruit notes. "
15059,1201912,"Clear, deep purple red with ruby rim, super slow tears. Clean, medium plus intensity nose, filled with stewed plums and raisins. Dry, full body, medium plus acid, medium tannins, more stewed plums and raisins ripe dark cherry, black currant, blackberry and blueberry, baking spices and black pepper. Medium finish."
15060,1201912,"Very young, it needs many year ahead to find perfection and balance"
15061,1201912,"Still very young, but it is reasonably approachable (for a vintage port this young) with very early decanting. Deep purple. Rich sweet fruits and some heat on the nose. Similar once you taste it, with a hefty does of tannins (still quite drying even after a lot of time in the decanter) and a bit of harshness towards the finish. If you're looking for a 2011 port to enjoy now, this is as good as I've had, but obviously it'll be improving over the next 10+ years."

15064,1201912,Truly wonderful port perfect for ending a meal. Deep in color with smooth tannins and delicious fruit character. 
15065,1201912,"Still too young. It seems little aqueous, but it seems that in few years aroma will go to good level."
15066,1201912,One of the best.
15067,1201912,"A lovely port, bottled summer 2017, which has not yet closed down. Smells yummy, violets, blackberry and black cherry. The luxurious palate is a pleasure of warm dark fruit, plus gentle herbs and spices. Great port, drink now, or 2030 onwards!  Quinta da Romanceira is a 260yo estate, run by Christian Seely. This vintage port is mainly from two parcels of old vine Touriga Nacional (70%) and Touriga Franca (20%). The high quality Franca gives this (and other 2015s) their wonderfully floral aroma."
15068,1201912,"You could pour this straight on waffles; it's that syrupy thick and sweet. Other layers are present, but they pale in comparison with the strawberry, red cherry, and ripe blackberry – very ripe. It's tasty and approachable for all."
15069,1201912,"A very good port. Excellent balance and refined. A wonderful combination of subtle flavors like raisins, plums, liquorice and lots more. It is the balance and subtlety that stands out. A very pleasant acidity to balance the sweet tones. Mmm."
15070,1201912,Last from the three vintage port bought at Winefields - now we taste 2003 - nicely full bodied - brown sugar fudge tones and loads of sweet spices like cinnamon. Alcohol fully integrated in a round palate. 
15071,1201912,Could use 10 more years but very approachable for such a young wine. Balanced jammy fruit and smooth tannins.
15072,1201912,"I really need to decant this for a couple days to be fair. It’s young, herbaceous, licorice, extremely long finish. Not overly sweet. Has a bit of fruit tartness. See you in a couple days."
15073,1201912,Powerful nose with notes of cooked red fruits and berries plus some dried raisins. Long powerful palate on the same mature red fruits. Misses a bit of elegance and finesse but what power....
15074,1146596,"Interesting varietal! Not my 1st encruzado, but this had different flavours. Floral nose, but tasting notes were of vegetal and mineral, like straw and oily. Very smooth, dry and acidic. Paired with octapus and fried chicken, went better with the fried food."
15075,1146596,Pale lemon of gold. Medium aroma intensity of lemon hay and almonds. Dry. High acidity. Medium body in alcohol. On the palate it’s medium plus flavour intensity of lemon grapefruit honey and hay. Medium plus  finish and a very good wine
15076,1146596,Like a great Chablis. Briny. Minerals. Waxy mouth feel. Medium acidity. What a terrific wine and an amazing price to boot.
15077,1146596,"Oak, peach, grapefruit. Auchon. Cascais. "
15078,1146596,An entry point for well build encruzado wines. Lakes taste as it lakes some aging in bottle. Save it for 3-4 years. Neverless it is already pleasent. Butter and vanilla. Not perfect for sure but deserves a taste.
15079,1146596,"Pale lemon. Med+ intensity nose with golden apple, ripe lemon, peach yogurt, hints of pastry and vanilla. Dry, high acidity, med alc, med+ bodied, med+ intensity flavours of juicy peach with creamy body from lees contact and tangy lemon peel finish. Good texture and weight, interesting stuff."
15080,1146596,"White stonefruits, yellow pears, some green apples, gooseberries."
15081,1146596,"Smooth, silky delicious. Butter, oil"
15082,1146596,"For 🔠 E week, an Encruzado, one of my favourite Portuguese white varieties grown on just 295ha, mainly in the Dão from where it originates.  Med lemon. A heady mix of wood spice (part barrel-fermented) w. nutmeg, cassia & buttercream. Layered pineapple, white peach, white violet & orange blossom. Pretty & honeyed. Think white Burg meets Condrieu. Developing.  Dry. Rich yet fresh w. gorgeous peach, pineapple, melon, lemon sorbet & buttered pear. Light cinnamon spice w. m+ alc & a lightly toasted m+ finish."
15083,1146596,"Full of pear, “dushes” lemonade, butter with elegant orange zest nuances! Medium- body, medium acidity, bright but short taste with light bitterness! Not bad👌🏼 🇵🇹 "
15084,1146596,"As far as Encruzado goes – unusually clean, slightly understated, maybe because less acidity in front compared to other interpretations of this mono grape wine."
15085,1146596,"My first Encruzado white wine, from Dao. Mineral, subtle floral notes, a bit of a zest and spice. Paired well with variety of local, Portuguese, food in Madeira island. "
15086,1146596,"My first Encruzado and it made quite an impression. Fresh, vivacious and vibrant. Ripe fruits: lemons, passion fruit, papaya, orange zest balanced with crisp acidity along its suave, creamy texture oozing with flavour personality. It reminds me of a lighter version of an excellent white Burgundy. I can understand why this is considered one of Portugal's flagship whites. The joy of discovery. "
15087,1146596,"First try of an Encruzado from Dao. Balanced notes with hints of wood, butter and a slight metallic after taste. Elegant, slightly bitter finish. Enjoyable with fish and pork. "
15088,1146596,"Light golden robe, pineapple on the nose, a mouthful of saline aromas with minerals. "
15089,76419,"Dry and crisp white, very citrusy and floral, lovely pineapple nose and a lemony, green apple and mineral palate. Nicely paired with shrimp risotto 👌🏻"
15090,76419,"Strong minerals on the nose, possibly due to granite and schist soil. First sips, sour citrus bomb. Slowly appearing velvety sweetness. Acacia honey and silkiness at the end. Lovely 4+!"
15091,76419,"Easy drinking but yet a wine with character. A bit of lemon in the taste, high on acidity but also hints of fig, which elegantly rounds off this wine to a great tasting experience!"
15092,76419,"Aromatic and deep, with citrus, grapefruit and chamomile aromas. Flavors of lime, apple and pear, with notes of minerals and hints of straw and honey. Wonderful wine for a light meal on hot day!"
15093,76419,"Primer albarinho portugués que pruebo, perfecto para acompañar un ceviche, leve acidez y ligero, notas a pera y lima, muy bueno / First portuguese albarinho I try, really liked it, perfect ceviche companion, low acidity, light, hints of pears and lime, really good wine"
15094,76419,"I love good Portuguese wine and this is one of them. Complex aroma of apple 🍐 peach 🍑 and tropical minerals. Distinct dry full bodied taste of apple and lemon 🍋. Personally it tastes best at temperatures below 8°C. Cheers, Dan 🇱🇻"
15095,76419,"This white wine has an open straw colour with and a clear, shining appearance. An intense, harmonious wine, it has a surprising taste and a velvety finish that brings you in for more! "
15096,76419,"A good, solid Alvarinho. Apple, lemon and some softer pineapple. Crisp acidity. Tastes lighter than the 12.5% alcohol. Stony, mineral dry finish. A step up from the Aveleda alvarinho - loureira blend"
15097,76419,"Citrus on the nose, crispy, good minerality. Not much acidity, rather velvety. A good one with fish."
15098,76419,"Nice acidity, ripe fruitiness of tropical citruses and peach, medium body, lovely mineral finish. "
15099,76419,Great value Albariño to enjoy on it’s own or with fresh food. I paired it with Ta Pin Lu. 
15100,76419,Beautiful sushi pairing

15104,1205379,"Quinta de la Rosa is one of the few true ""Single Quintas"" it is not a second brand used by most large shippers for their ""off Vintage"" port years. Aromas of fruit and spice. On the palate plum and bright cherry fruit flavors, well balanced with acidity, very fresh taste from a year not declared by most houses. Lingering finish, good tannin backbone ending with cacao and sweet fruit tones."
15105,1205379,"This needs a lot of time to come into it's own but all the component parts for a great wine are in place here. A blend of predominately Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz & Tinta Barroca this is deep purple w. intense black fruit on the nose. Blackberry, black cherry & bramble predominate. Smoothly integrated spirit. Sweet, rich black fruit. Perfumed violets, dark chocolate, black cherry, blackberry & crème de mure. Very fine med.+ tannins and med.+ acidity balance well & will provide longevity."
15106,1205379,"Cherry, raisins, crushed walnut nose. Medium tannins. Medium-high acidity. Cherry, raspberry, and raisins. Still coming into itself - tight. Will be better later for sure. "
15107,1205379,"Deep garnet in color, no translucence. Reddish pink rim. Raspberry syrup and raisin nose. Concentrated fruit. Body is full of dark cherry, cherry, raisins, plums, and blackberries on the body. 4.3 stars. "
15108,1205379,"Full bodied, round and delicious. Dark lingering fruits without much sweetness or spice; almost liquorish... Recommended."
15109,1205379,"Even for a Vintage this young, I really liked it, and I can't wait to see how it will evolve in time."
15110,1205379,Concentrated. Fruity. Vibrant. Already pleasant but still young. I recommend six years more of cellaring.
15111,1205379,soupy thick vanilla hint berries fiery echo on palate 
15112,1205379,Great port. This ruby is fruity and drinks easily!
15113,1205379, This wine is rich and spicy with layers of dried raisin and prune flavors along with a light touch of acidity. Drinking well. 
15114,1205379,A vintage port you will quickly forget.
15115,1205379,I like this one. It will be one of my favourite.
15116,1205379,Rich and dark. Dark berries. Blackcurrant. Fig. Long aftertaste. 
15117,1205379,"I would venture to say that the 2011 is simply monumental. The experience in 10, 15 or more years, one can imagine only approximate. With magnificent length be wasteful and complex flavor stops. Juicy, full-bodied, with ultrafine tannins he reveals an incredible harmony and elegance."
15118,1205379,WITH BLUE CHEESE
15119,69664,Excellent at the price point and more depth of flavor than the Taylor 10 year tawny.  Dried red fruit with a good mouth feel that lingers.  The fruit is much more preserved here than in the tawny.
15120,69664,"Oh that’s good LBV 👍🏻  I’m enjoying it!  Blueberry jam, forest berry jam, oak, chocolate, fruity, intense and heavy in a good way. I’m now thinking about grabbing a bottle of ruby or LVB or 10 yo tawny home 😍"
15121,69664,"Great Wines of the World - Seoul 2019 by James Suckling, - last batch.  Aaaand... managed to finish the night on my own feet, with style and with a wonderful glass of Vintage Port in my hand. Thanks everyone and cheers!😁👍🍷"

15138,2545450,"Vivino, eight years later 🍷 Bom Natal 🎄  "
15139,2545450,Iconic. Remarkable. An outstanding wine for sure. Acquired at Cartuxa-Portugal by a friend in Jan’20. Great moment with great friends yesterday night. Cheers !

15141,2545450,Very full bodied powerful wine. Not an aperitif! Very reminiscent of big Tuscan wines like Ornellaia. 
15142,2545450,Wooow. Fantastic Portugiese white. Smooth  fruity and a long moth aftertaste

15149,1308697,"This is a lighter bodied wine than the ""Douro superior"" top Douro table wines that are becoming more common, but is more elegant and smooth."
15150,1308697,"Nice balance, great smooth oaked wine."
15151,1308697,"Compared to vallado field blend in blind tasting very long, but less complex, really feeling like it comes from a warmer region: the douro superior"
15152,1308697,Dry deep cherry tobacco. Slowly blossoming.
15153,1308697,with bacalau a good combination

15160,1308697,"Dark berries, slightly spicy and nice integrated wood. Great with raindeer! "
15161,1308697,nice dark wine with Earthy flavours but little fruit and freshness.
15162,1308697,"Great Wine from Portugal, nice tannins , long finish. Beautiful "
15163,1308697,Fruity. Main responsible is Touriga Nacional... Very good
15164,1308697,"Great candidate for long term keeping. Powerful and structured. Medium pronounced. Blackberries and black cherries. Oak- Spice, cinnamon. Youthful. Deep purple colour. Dry high acidity, high tannins, high alcohol. Full-bodied. Blackfruits. Concentrated. Medium finish. Way too young to drink now, leave it for a decade in cellar before it can show its qualities."
15165,1308697,"Medium-full bodied, medium-high acidity, moderate-high tannin, dry. Dark fruits, some smoke. Great with a hunk of salty cheese"
15166,1308697,"Deep violet in color, packed with dark cherries, plums and a hint of raisin, almost a bit ""porty"". Slightly unbalanced with acidity taking over, but paired with the right food..."
15167,1308697,"Lindo Douro! Aromas de frutas negras, especiarias, madeira e baunilha. Elegante e equilibrado. Uma maravilha! 🍷  Beautiful Douro! Aromas of blackberries, spices, wood and vanilla. Elegant and balanced. Wonderful!🍷"
15168,1308697,Deep ruby red colour. Portugals national grape makes a perfect display. Aromas of vanilla. Intense in the mouth with a long and nice finish. Will definetely get even better with a few years in the cellar.
15169,1308697,"Notes from a Portuguese tasting a while back: very nice fragrant floral and red berry nose. On the palate really nice and full-bodied and almost chewy texture. Plummy fruit, really dark roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, woody barky and leather. I like it! 4++"
15170,1308697,"Purchased in the Azores, brought home in our luggage and waited. My new Riedel Amadeo decanter arrived today and this beautiful wine was our first in my new toy. Super dark, silky smooth tannins, great expression of the amazing 2011 Douro Reds. "
15171,1308697,Big and tasty. Crunchy tannins and bold structure. Could lay down a bit or open up. But great specimen. Good with food. 
15172,1308697,"Classic, very good vintage"
15173,1308697,Never been a fan of this wine but this is spectacular.
15174,1308697,So Fullbodied. Enjoyed. 
15175,1308697,Nice wine bought in Lisbon. Had delicious character of berries.
15176,1308697,Fruity.  But smooth.  You dont feel the 14.5. Even felt dry. Just pure fun
15177,1308697,"Love it  Very dark , dry let silky smooth  Buying more ! "
15178,1308697,"Black ink.  Black cherry, vanilla, wood, wet hay, spices. Coffee, green pepper.  Toasty red fruit, lots of tannins, over medium acidity. Full bodied at first, but declines rapidly. Succulent fruit, wood and a touch of vanilla. Long herby and tart finish. 92"
15179,80037,"Bearing in mind this is far too young it has an element of maturity to its aromas of herbs black fruit and spice.  The tannins need time, lots of time, to moderate."
15180,80037,"A more recent 2012 Port from Quinta da Roeda Douro. Although young, it has a very good balance and elegance."
15181,80037,Oh yeah... give this one 5-10 years and we’re singing...
15182,80037,perfect for a single vineyard port at this stage. Port aging with dark fruit for days.
15183,80037,91 creamy and fruit Intensed
15184,80037,"Dark stewed fruit. Blackberry, damson, black currant, chocolate, tar, mainly fruit.   Bala ace of tannin and sweetness. Not too sweet, very restrained. "
15185,80037,"Great vintage, still could rest for years to mature and age though. The taste is just pure happiness with notes of dark berries, chocolate, plums and some tobacco scents. "
15186,80037,This single vineyard Croft port is only produced in years of exceptional quality when a general Porto vintage is not called. The grapes are still pressed by foot so as not to bruise the seeds and skin.   This offering was nearly black in color with a musty nose of wild herbs and dried berries. Dense and jammy fruit lifted by a lighter raspberry layer with crisp acidity and firm tannins. Decadent. 20% ABV. 4.25🌟 
15187,80037,"It's a very rustic, a little rough around the edges, but still enjoyable port. Sherried dark red fruits, liquorice, Turkish Delight, hints of leather. Firm, super drying tannins. A little nutty bitterness on the slightly fruity but drying finish."
15188,80037,"Nose isn't too expressive but the palete is very elegant. Touch of herbalness and perfume. Dry, medium bodied. "
15189,80037,First time trying port at Quinta de Roeda! Not the biggest fan of sweet wines but it was very refreshing after a hot day. 
15190,80037,Really nice Port that I would keep for a nice time with good friends.

15194,4132982,Slightly dry wine with mellow fruity flavor. Mellow and smooth. Delightful!
15195,4132982,"Fruity, dry but with a velvety texture. A pleasant wine. "
15196,4132982,"A powerhouse. Deep red in the color. Loads of fresh red and blue fruits. Full bodied. Smells of oak,  blueberry cinnamon and matured cherry. Long aftertaste! The wine is young and needs some more time to get the right complexity. Recommend! 4p!"
15197,4132982,"Young and strong wine. Needs a couple of more years to develop. Blueberry, black berries, beautiful tannins "
15198,4132982,Fruit forward low tannins.  Dry.  What more can one ask?
15199,4132982,"Rather discreet aromas of red cherries, dried leaves and cinnamon. Rubi to red not too dark and opaque colour. Soft smooth flavours of red fruit and vegetables beetroot, with a long acidity and rather round tanins... Nice wine for under 9€!!"
15200,4132982,"Intriguing fruity beetroot scent? Soily taste, lots of tanines. Long dry finish."
15201,4132982,Good wine. Crispy with a blueberry taste
15202,4132982,Smooth Fullish body with nice well rounded flavours.

15204,4132982,"Fruity, dry, unoaked. Smooth tannins, easy to drink. High acidity. Full bodied, Medium long lasting."
15205,4132982,"Ruby colour, a nice bouquet of aromas, from the typical red fruits to the tomato leaf. Medium intensity in taste, very dry, powerfull tannins, yet somehow elegant at the begining and after they just blow ypur tongue. High acidity, this wine will last at least 5/6 more years. It has some spices due to its grapes. But very mild. Medium long finish."
15206,4132982,"Circii, Quinta da Confeiteira 2013. In this wine, the dominating words are for sure agressiveness. Probably due to the different technique used by this brand instead of the wood, the wine gets a hard profile - specialy for the new taster!  Nose 3/5 Mouth 2,7/5 Color and Tear 3/5 End of Mouth 2/5"
15207,4132982,Good wine. Needs to open early...
15208,4132982,"Fruity, dry and great with a meal"

Very refreshing. Easy pairing with food.  🍗 Serve with batered in panko tiger prawns with honey glaze and cashews nuts cramble."
15215,1575559,"11th of 12 Mini reviews at a Tasting in the Palacio Bolsa in Porto! Only One Left!  Color: Nearly Colorless Yellow  Nose: Lemon, Jasmine  Taste: Lemon, Orange, Jasmine   I've always had a fondness for Alvarinho and this is no exception. Sharp, clean, and brutally refreshing this white is exactly what you need as a tourist in a hot country. My only negative comment is how flat it falls compared to some of the other rich ones I've encountered. Wish it was more complex but the spartan simplicity is also a draw"
15216,1575559,"Perfect refreshing wine, characterfull; wirh a little bit of the Malvasia grape to round up the taste! This Alvarinho is not from Vinho Verde-region, but from vineyards aatound national capital: lisboa. "
15217,1575559,"Delicious alvarinho. Mineral, fruity. Jolly good wine. Great company makes wine even better, so pardon my biased review."
15218,1575559,Encorpado e com boa acidez.
15219,1575559,Nice wine for an afternoon. Notes of citrus fruits on the nose and a fruity taste with a creamy finish.
15220,1575559,Fruity with peaches an butter. Good for it's price.
15221,1575559,Craig was given this bottle by the  guy at the pub we had  tapas at
15222,1575559,Too simple  An ok wine for a very low cost however I’d pay a bit more to get a tasty one ☝️ 
15223,1575559,Perfect with pulpo
15224,1650763,"This is the white version, which is confusing Vivino because of the label. Smell is apple and taste is peachy - but it’s very subtle. This is as good as Planalto - from the same winery"
15225,1650763,"First off, the listing above states this is a red wine! It is clearly! A white wineEven the label states Vino Branco! So my rating is based on this wire wine from the Douro. So grape Vinhos is Portugal’s biggest producer. They’ve been at it a looong time. Remember Mateus? That’s there founding wine I think. But they have many other great wines in their cellars. I’m not sure what grapes are used for this wine, but it’s a very balanced (light) white with hints of green plums and fresh cut flowers."
15226,1650763,Fruity light great with seafood 
15227,1650763,Light and clean on the palate

15232,1650763,"Had a glass of this from Sea Me in Lisbon. Delicious—strong oak structure, with nice vanilla and tobacco notes. Red fruit, but dry."
15233,1650763,"Quite nice and flavorful. Red fruit and black fruit, blackberry notes, topped with hints of chocolate and vanilla. Bot of oak, too. Slightly tannic. "
15234,1650763,"Cant ask for more for the price.  Very intense color, full body, nice legs, jam on the nose, spicy, very good acidity, tannins maybe too untamed."
15235,1650763,Part of the greatest hits of Portuguese wine for sure. Very approachable and very delicious. Can never go wrong with a bottle of Papa Figos
15236,1650763,It’s good. Great balance w acid and fruit. Minerally for sure but I often find good w connecting the terroir this way w whites 
15237,1650763,"4.2 👃 Chocolate, vanille, dark fruits 👅 Black cherry, pepper, black currabt, chocolate Medium tannine, medium to long aftertaste Cheers!"
15238,1650763,Asserts a signal vinous authority which eases into a sweet swell of jammy whorls. A roundel of raisins and a swirl of sultanas. Excellent. 
15239,6978094,"Mushroom, forest floor, violet, toast, cedar, eucalyptus, spicy, chocolate, fig, plum and strawberry jam.  Not bad, balanced med tannins and acidity med+, alc 13% suits, but slightly too oaky PN. Nothing from fresh fruits. For 2019 is unexpected. Anyway that’s fine. Almost organic. Careful triage.

15240,6978094,"To contrast the plum, cherry this wine has a nice acidity and smoke."
15241,6978094,This one is a red.
15242,6978094,Light and refreshing 
15243,6978094,"I was pleasantly surprised by this wine, Lisbon not being an intuitive growing ground for Pinot. Big fat red fruit— red cherry, red and black plum, cranberry, strawberry — upheld by some very nice acidity and light oak and toast notes. "
15244,6978094,Great Pinot! Lots of berries 
15245,6978094,Very smooth and light bodied. 
15246,6978094,Nice wine with light body and smooth taste ! Very interesting wine and happy to have try one Pinot noir from Portugal. 
15247,6978094,"Portugal Pinot 🇵🇹. Smoky, red cherry, leather, slightly herbal. A basic Pinot. "
15248,6978094,"Não e Pinot clássico. Veja muita acidez, fruta como cereja, mas ainda desbalanceado este vinho serve para queijos leves. Não se engane, não e um vinho para caixas. Mais para provas.  No and classic Pinot.  See lots of acidity, fruit like cherry, but still unbalanced this wine serves for light cheeses.  Make no mistake, it's not to paid a full box.  More for taste."
15249,6978094,My intro to Portuguese pinot noir. Drinkable without being remarkable. Finish is very short. 
15250,6978094,Intense wood and a lot of minerals with a note of vanilla and green coffee
15251,6978094,"Good value, a peppery note, good fruit and body"
15252,6978094,"Red fruit, good acidity, medium tannins and body. But not as intense and complex as a Pinot should be. "
15253,6978094,Smoke and tobacco tones. Strong tannins. Good wine to enjoy on its own. 
15254,1391737,"Wonderful value for money Douro. Extremely fragrant, with gorgeous notes of cherry, plum, orange peel, vanilla and caramel, evolving into an almost chocolate cake-like profile. On the palate, dry, bold and spicy with velvety round tannins, good acidity and a deep, smoky profile of black fruit and dark chocolate. Feel like this one deserves more than it’s getting in Vivino - solid 4⭐️ for my taste."
15255,1391737,It’s a good all rounder from the Douro but maybe lacks a tiny bit of depth. Was sold as a ‘huge reduction’ from €14 to €5 in a Portuguese supermarket ( don’t usually buy in supermarkets!) but needs must on occasions.  It’s better than average; has fine nose and I’d buy it again ( but not at €14! 
15256,1391737,"Vanilla, plum, leather "
15257,1391737,"Full body for a Douro. Solid, but nothing extraordinary."
15258,1391737,Very juicy douro/Portuguese wine. Dark fruits.
15259,1391737,"Notes of cedar, cherries, and blackberry. Fairly smooth but with a lingering finish."
15260,1391737,Surprisingly spicy Douro. And the high alcohol hits the olfactory senses. Not bad but as usual fairly overpriced in a restaurant 
15261,1391737,"Well Bodied as should be when from duro. This is the Hulk from its gentle side.    Instant hit of black currant, pickled cherry and stable.   On the palette it’s packed of red fruit and dark fruits with traits of chocolate licorice and oak. "
15262,1391737,Compot of plums and crunchy tannins. Bold wine with a long finish 
15263,1391737,"Deep burgundy colour. Blackberry, black currant and plum. Soft, but bold feel in the mouth. The tannins and oak has done the wine good after 3 years. Full bodied and lingering aftertaste. "
15264,1391737,Blend of 4 grapes. Makes the wine somewhat different from regular Douro wine. Expressive noise with fruit. Taste cherries with some nuts bitter.  Long finish a bit spicy.

15266,1391737,"Vanilla vanilla and vanilla. Well balanced, pleasantly dry, no acidity. Definitely good value for money 🙌"

15269,2280924,"Bright deep ruby colour with intense notes of toasted oak barrels. Very rich and structured, pronounced aromatic nature with hints of  cherry, blackberry,  cassis,  plum, licorice, mingled with spices and chocolate. Balanced with pleaseant acidity and well integrated alcohol. Long fine and velvety finish. High potential for aging."
15270,2280924,"Great aromatic character of fine barrel toasted oak, mixed with dark raspberry fruit,black cherry pastilles, prune compote and hints of dark chocolate, licorice and tobacco, all in perfect harmony. Elegant wine with great structure , a fine treatment and a huge aging potential!"
15271,2280924,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit). Ruby / violet color, full-bodied, medium-dry. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Douro region. Contains sulfites. 14,5.° alcoholics.   "

15277,2280924,Superb wine - decanted as its 8 years old. 90 points. Lovely nose of rubber and blueberries. Nice burgundy color and a taste of ripe red berries. Lovely viscosity and nice tannins. Medium to fuller body and structure. Doesn't hold as the food flavors get stronger. Otherwise would rate higher.
15278,2495612,"This is an amazing bottle of wine!!! Starting with the branding, bottle, history and label.  Everything is balanced, perfect! Round, long and persistence.  Smoky, leather, rip red fruits, spices. Perfect tannins and acidity  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ "

15283,2495612,"Fresh, probably impossible to replicate in any scenario, it should be, and deserves to, be the only red wine during a long meal. It changes accordingly to the evolution of the menu, always making sure it is the best you could find around the world."
15284,2495612,"bold and smooth with light tannins, very soft and very pleasant "
15285,2495612,Great wine! Pairing dinner with older Mondavi and Bordeaux. This one will grow with age. Required some time to open up the flavour.
15286,2495612,Uau ... wow  Follows previous vintages characteristics and being so young (2014) is ready to drink / drinkable and yet prepared for a long cellar time. 
15287,2495612,"Legado means legacy and is one of Portugal‘s best and finest wines. There’s great complexity on the nose , with fresh red cherry fruit, smoky plum and stewed boysenberries coupled with cinnamon spice, grated ginger, crushed black pepper, cedar, cigar wrapper and pencil shavings . On the palate it is elegant but powerful with great purity and notable freshness allied to silky and very well- integrated tannins that give the wine a harmonious texture and personality. The finale is extremely lengthy and comp"
15288,2495612,Smooth and silky. Bold. Forest flavours with peppery capsicum mixed in. Seriously enjoyable 🍷 Happy drinking.
15289,2495612,"Another amazing wine at Jncquoi in Lisbon. Dark fruit, heavy dark chocolate and amazingly treated oak. Stil waaaay to young and needs at least 15+ until ready. The finish was long and wow, talk about potential in this bad boy!! "
15290,2495612,Magnificent red blend from Casa Ferreirinha. A jewell from Douro valley. One of the best wines I' ve ever tasted. World class wine!
15291,2495612,"Fabulous. Balance. Oaky. Elegance. Delicious. These are just some of the qualities of this masterpiece that, in my humble opinion, is part of my 5-star galaxy and the world's. Please, if you consider yourself a wine addict, save some bucks or just don't look at the tag. Buy it. Final mark. Pleasure guaranteed from the first sip to the empty bottle!!"
15292,2495612,The legacy of Douro! 
15293,1553953,"Oooooooh lovely. Had a yeasty, creamy edge that dulled any oversweetness. Caramel, fig and honey with citrus edge."
15294,1553953,"Normally we don’t enjoy desert wine that much, specially white ones, but this one is from another level. Gold orange colored, thick, very buttery structure, some apricot and some caramel like notes.  When chilled is a very fresh experience."
15295,1553953,"Dessert wine, yellow fruits "
15296,1553953,"14.5% alcohol, pale amber. Botrytis and citrus on the nose, lime, barley sugar and caramel notes on the palate. A ripe late harvest Malvasia, worthy of further cellaring."
15297,1553953,"One of my favourite desert wines. No overpowering syrups or teeth-shredding sweetness. Served chilled , accompanied a light creamy pavlova and finished off a great meal"
15298,1553953,This is a true gem of a desert wine.  Huge orange and citrus notes which deliver on the taste.  More subtle than its French inspirations and I have to say that I prefer it.  This when very well with a rich orange vases desert - a great pairing
15299,1553953,Really nice sticky but without the overbearing sweetness that so often drags down these wines. I'm posturing that this pairs well with a blue Stilton or other sharp cheeses including the humble cheddar!
15300,1553953,Fully matured. Lovely bouquet. 
15301,1553953,One of my favorite dessert wines 
15302,1553953,Malvasia based botrytised sweetly. Lots of  acidity at the end. Wonderful with rich puddings 
15303,1553953,Exceptional late harvest. Perfect balance between acidic tastes and sweet tastes. Reminds me of a very good Sauternes. 
15304,1553953,"Well this is a quite delicious desert wine! Sticky and golden syrupy at first, with notes of apricot, but with a slightly acidic finish to add balance."
15305,1553953,"Malvasia grapes variety brings this late harvest to total different level, apricot and quince notes, good acidity very intense and figs on the last feeling."
15306,1127986,At this price level you get an outstanding port with lots of red fruit and vanilla. Not too sweet and certainly not outstanding but again at this price very very good
15307,1127986,"Intense dark fruit, jam like. Vanilla and a little chocolate. Nicely sweet flavour from start to finish. Very enjoyable."
15308,1127986,"Intense, still purple color. Sweet cherry in the chocolate, blackberry, raspberry, jam, forest fruits, no oak yet. "
15309,1127986,"What a fine port by Burmeister; dark fruit, jam, some vanilla. Simply stunning!"
15310,1127986,"Very smooth, can't be compared to drinking a red wine for example. Sweet, well-rounded, loads of dark berries. "
15311,1127986,"Very dark ruby with violet reflexes in the glass. Nose is leather, oak and dried black fruits. Mouth is more fruity. Blueberry, blackberry, cherry, plum, raisin, oak, leather, vanilla..... Ahh...what a reach bouquet! Wine is smooth, not very sweet and just delicious!"

15318,1127986,"Black cherry, prunes a hint of spiciness and earthy notes. The alcohol may smack your nose around, but this is a very yummy Late Bottle Vintage port"
15319,1127986,"Left this one out for Santa with the kids before getting to actually try it.  Deep violet colour with a sweet delicate nose of black fruits. In the mouth it’s silky and bold, black cherry fruit with notes of black currant and  balsamic. A great balance of fruit, acidity, tannins and sugar."
15320,1127986,"Lovely deep purple color. Aroma of blackberry, alcohol, fruit and wood. Full sweet taste well balanced with acidity and tannins. Juicy fruits, berries, mainly blackberry and cherry, hints of tobacco and wood. Long lasting."
15321,1167128,"Pale yellow color. Soft ripe tropical fruit aroma, with mineral nuances. In the taste it is unctuous, fresh, elegant and with well integrated toasted notes, resulting from the fermentation in French oak barrels.  Persistent finish. excellent value for money."
15322,1167128,"What a surprise, notes of tropical fruits and very smooth finish"
15323,1167128,"Pale yellow colour. 13.5% alcohol. Too much oak. Otherwise it would be subtle, delicate and refreshing."
15324,1167128,Tasted quite dry before we started eating but matched our seafood starters perfectly. Oak vanilla but also tropical fruit maybe toasted pineapple??  Interestingly still seemed to match our ice cream / sorbet desert. Almost a chameleon of a wine!

Pale lemon. Nose of grapefruits, tropical fruits like mango, papaya & pineapple, vanilla, white flowers & honey. Dry, oak flavor dominant and masks other fruits flavor. Med acidity expands from middle palate to finish. Med body & length. On day 1, too oaky & little unbalanced but on day 2, the flavor gets more integrated."
15332,1167128,Pale yellow with peachy undertones. A nice Dão. Saúde!
15333,1167128,Very buttery and heavy white but a decent level of acidity and easily drinkable. At 9.99 euros very decent value.

15335,1167128,"Surrounded by hedges, boxwoods, and labyrinths of flowers: Casa de Santar is a beautiful family-owned winery and also the biggest private estate in the region in terms of vineyard area. Santar has 120 hectares of vines split between two locations. They mostly use French oak from Seguin Moreau, and American oak from Nadalie. Our wine is aged in Seguin Moreau. On the nose prominent notes of floral and tropical fruit. Its acidity shines very brightly and it drops into a palate loaded with citrus notes….."
15336,1148718,"Astonishingly great value, if not one of the best accomplished creations around it packs a velvety punch - damsons and sour cherry with blackcurrants in tow, a sliver of green chilli adds a little spicy element - well rounded purple spiced fruit with a sting in it’s tail - lovely!"
15337,1148718,"Great wine very juicy,plum,raspberry and some earthy notes. Well balanced finish with medium tannins makes it perfect choice for any type of food. "

15371,5036434,Beautiful rich jam and dark fruit on the nose. Super dark in colour. Decent balance but a really heavy rich wine. Took quite a while to get through but in a good way. Had to revert to pairing with cheese to get through the last of it.

This Arinto set the tone, really nice discovery in my favorite local restaurant and from the same city.  Very faint barnyard in the nose at first but this clears up to floral notes, blossom, apricot, grapefruit and tons of minerality. In the palate very pronounced but so pure and enjoyable, crisp acidity, grapefruit again and lime. 3.9"

15383,4995741,"84/100 Notes of green pear, yellow peach, pine, grass, and a touch of chalkiness. This has plenty of texture for a wine made in stainless steel. The salinity here is intense. The acidity and sourness is a bit out of balance here. I like the producer, but this wine isn’t cutting it for me. "
15384,4995741,"Interesting wine,  I can say: “Sharp wine” Especially for Arinto lovers ;)  Enjoy! 👌🏾 Saúde 🥂  "
15385,4995741,"Citrus, great minerality, orange blossom, orange peel"

15389,4995741,"4.3/5.0. Really liked this wine! A rare single varietal Portuguese wine with notes of honey, peach and minerality. Not the most fragrant on the nose, but delicious on the palate."
15390,4995741,"Really nice medium bodied white, lemon oil, fully dry and bright on the palate, med + acidity lots for the region. Has a characteristic grip reminiscing of Savennieres actually. Cucumber mint, eucalyptus, unripe apple. Damn impressive "
15391,4995741,"Beautiful dry juicy white with loads of lemon, minerals and creamy texture. Finishes with a lovely acidic tang."
15392,4995741,Taste on the dry side and as if it came pouring out of a cool mineral cave.
15393,4995741,"Pear notes on the nose, dry with a good amount of sweetness but not overwhelmingly sweet like a sauterne "
15394,4995741,"A lovely expression of Arinto de Bucelas which originates from Bucelas just north of Lisbon. It’s widely planted also in Dão & Vinho Verde, but this unoaked example is from the DOC of Óbidos north of Bucelas.  Pale lemon. Med aroma intensity w. a touch of kerosene, green apple, lemon & grapefruit. Light white peach & melon adds weight. Elegant & youthful.  Dry. Fresh & zesty w. lifted m+ acid, m(-) body, m. alc & zingy apple, lemon & grapefruit. Peach, red apple & orange citrus peel to a m+ finish. Summery!"

15400,4898958,Grapefruit with hints of pineapple and mango. Very drinkable. 
15401,4898958,"This grape called Antao vaz from Alentejo Portugal has a Medium Yellow colour with a light to medium texture, very dry with only 1.6g/L of sugar and a medium-high but refreshing acidity. It has faint citrus and mineral notes with an almost frizzy champagne-like (but not sour) flavour that hide the decent dose of alcohol (14%). It went well with the sautéed shrimp & stuffed rice and mozzarella bell peppers. Great value for money 3.75 rating."
15402,4898958,"Pale chrysanthemum color with medium aromas of tropical citrus, hay, and floral on the nose. Medium-bodied together with fresh flavors of Thai gooseberry, passion fruit, red apple, and touch of salty-mineral on the palate. Dry with medium(+) acidity, and medium(+) aftertaste at the end. Nice wine but a bit light on fruit intensity."

15408,4898958,Great wine! Soft woody and wild berries flavours. 
15409,4898958,"One of rhe best bellow 15€. Sweet, citric and mineral. A slow start, needs some oxidity, but  ends up surprising. A good structure resembling wines with longer staging. A ery good option for  daily wines."
15410,4898958,"Near perfect Portuguese partner for a robalo grelhado, grilled seabass. Distinct gooseberries, grapefruit and pear present themselves. Make sure to tilt this bottle out of the fridge at least 15 minutes before drinking. The sooner the more fruits for you 👍"
15411,1175612,"This is good. Really, really good. Having spent more than 40 years in casks it was bottled 14 days ago and it is in absolutely perfect condition. Pure pleasure!"

15413,1175612,"4.7. What an incredible treat! Absolutely stunning! Still so much life and energy in this bottle. Plenty of red cherry and red plum fruit, along with cedar, potpourri, dried herbs and earthy notes. Long finish reveals different notes in turn, like gentle waves rolling against your ankles on a warm beach at sunset."
15414,1175612,Fabulous. Amazing. Thick and powerful. Sweet and spicy. Dark caramel color. Long finish. A gorgeous Colheita!!!

15416,1175612,"Soft juicy, fresh with walnut and oxydative notes.  Perfect with Chocolate"
15417,1175612,"Tasting at Quinta do Noval. Delicious vintage Tawny Port from the historic 145ha estate in Pinhão. Owned by the AXA Millésimes group since '93. Colheitas are from a single vintage. Unlike Vintage Port, is matured for a long time in casks. This one was aged close to 40yrs before being bottled.  Nose: earthy notes mingle with coffee. Nice acidity.  Palate: concentrated smooth sweetness with oxidative, nutty mushroom. Some smokey cedar+caramel with fresh orange zest. Awesome acidity keeps everything elegant."
15418,1175612,"A wonderful and overpowering bouquet of of sweet caramel and dried fruits, with a hint of tobacco. Amazing!!  Even more thrilling, the senses are blown away. So wonderfully balanced. Dried fruits, aromatic, honey, caramel and roasted nuts.  With a taste so rich and deep and a never ending finish.  97"
15419,1175612,Rust red and brown.  Lifted nose of dried flowers  marzipan raisins and figs.  Medium weight but full on flavour with Nutty notes.   Long finish.  I'm still getting sweet soya bean curd notes!
15420,1175612,"90pts. We ended or dinner with this good Port. Walnuts, caramelized raw sugar, lacking a bit of complexity and freshness. Still enjoyable. @Mövenpick Wein Bar, Wine & Dine"
15421,1175612,"The great old colheita - wonderful choice for ""Portugal"" style port lovers. Perfect balance, deep and elegance body. On the peak now."
15422,1175612,"Fruité, intense, complexe"
15423,1175612,"Nuts baby, nuts, oh yeah! With a great touch, dried citrus zest, touch of caramel walnut wanna try again in the next years :)"
15424,1175612,"This is a great port, vibrant and delicious, and for me half a star better than Noval’s Colheita 2000.  My notes said “drink and celebrate life!”.    Light tawny colour.  Nose of caramel, orange, fruitcake, walnut and wood smoke. The palate is quite developed, very silky, with clove, cinnamon and nutmeg spice. High acidity, but not as high as the 2000 vintage.  Superb! "
15425,1175612,"Great port. Colhetas are bottles on demand. Fully oxidized and elevated on alcool (21.5%), it will age forever "
15426,1192486,Very Nice gift from Portugal. Needs lots of air to reach full potential. Very nice smell with red berries and sweet tannines. Unfortunate medium after taste

Medium body, balanced, present acidity, polished tannins and medium range and mineral finish."
15431,1192486,Good with roasted meats and stews. Bold wine. Blackberry and smoke.   Should be lightly sipped with your meal or some cheese. Reminds me of my youth and the Barbera from Napa Valley .
15432,1192486,This bangs hard
15433,1192486,Super fruity - ripe berries and stone fruit. Easy to drink and delicious

Nose: pronounced, oak barrel, forest black fruits, licorice, smoke barrel, tobacco nuance, leather, earthy accents. In the mouth: a strong wine, full of fruitiness, the taste of ripe black fruit, jam, licorice, vanilla, cinnamon, toast, toffee. Well structured, rich wine has a beautiful balance between mineral acidity and ripe, velvety tannins, muscular. Finish unique, elegant."

15450,1248320,This is a freaking awesome wine- WL 
15451,1248320,"Tobacco, dry leaves and black fruits on the nose. Its still green and astringent palate expresses much less than the nose indicates. I have doubts if further aging makes it significantly better. (7.2 pts) "
15452,1248320,"Came recommended by the waitress in a Vila Real restaurant in Portugal and for €12 can’t complain: the wine is very approachable, inky dark red in the glass, almost intense, woody characteristics, quite complex and fruity. Paired well with rich beef stew."
15453,1248320,"On the nose a hint of stables and leather. The taste of plums, dark Cherry and some acidity, maybe citrus(?). Slightly more than medium tannins. Very agreeable to nose and mouth."
15454,1248320,"Smell of berries, good acidic, mild tannis, become interesting after decant for 2 hours, wine opens up "
15455,1248320,"Earthy nose, strawberry, slightly thin, 7.4"
15456,1614453,"Sneaky one... Starts with sweetness which disappears over time. Red fruits and plums, plum jam...oak later... Long taste... Dark color.. nice...."
15457,1614453,"3.9 is very well matching score for this wine. Full body, tannins is medium, Light sweetness at the beginning, which disappear quite quickly and one can fill that the wine is dry. Cherry and wood/barrel in nose. Taste is based on cherry and plum, with nice dark chocolate at the finish."
15458,1614453,A bit sweet but ok overall. 
15459,1614453,"Unlike its explosive counterpart, this boootlie did not blow me up or away.    But I would recommend it to friends."
15460,1614453,"Almeida Garrett TNT Touriga Nacional - Trincadeira 2017.   Alcohol is just right. A lot of energy and freshness.  Bodegas Almeida Garrett Côte Vermeille 2018 4 is full body, a little heavy, soft and round, but it´s not rough. Sweetness is light, and at the end, after a while it gives you a touch of bitterness, but the alcohol is well balanced.  Bodegas Almeida Garrett Côte Vermeille - Vinha Verde 2018 4.0 is a very good score for this wine, with a complex and long finish."
15461,1614453,No wonder why is the most selled portuguese wine in the UK in 2015. Dry and easy to drink. Same percistence during the session.
15462,1614453,"Next course at Wine and Play, Ottawa. Pairing with Lingcod."
15463,1614453,"Good value, nice drinking wine"

15466,1614453,Fruity with nice tannins.
15467,1614453,"Raisin and plum. Easy to drink, and still some tannins. Perfect to a pasta."
15468,1614453,"A velvety rich red wine with explosive wild fruit flavour and soft tannines. The two grapes complement each other in this harmonious blend, creating body, spice and violet expressions. Aged for 6 months in French oak barrels. Een zeer zachte, speciale smaak! Pure enjoyment!"
15469,1614453,"Fruity, taste of blackberries, hint of chocolate, rich in tannins."
15470,1154893,"Elegant, fruity profile as it still very young, powerful but nice tannins - a solid wine with a bright future "
15471,1154893,N/R corked unfortunately 
15472,1154893,Very nice port wine
15473,1154893,"4.1+/5.0 Finally Vintage. 1999 Bottled in 2002. Already medium garnet color. Nice tertiary aromas.  Prunes, stone, tobacco, coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla, dry berries. Med .tannins.  High alco. Fresh acidity 20%, 98 gr.sugar.  Tinta Roriz, Tinta Amarella, Bastardo, Touriga Franca. Resume: very good, but still, I guess could be better in the future. Degustation: ""Porto, all styles"", 12.2020."
15474,1154893,"35 years in the making and possibly past its best but well worth the wait (can't believe I'd forgotten it was in the cellar!). Very pale in colour - almost rosé. Wonderful mature aromas - raspberry and kirsch fruit, leather and coffee. Light on tannins, but still a bit of acidity to play against the sweet flavours - liqueur cherries in dark chocolate. Shared with good friends after a great meal - unbeatable."
15475,1154893,"Hint of strawberries, raspberries on nose. On taste: Raspberry, chocolate."
15476,1154893,Absolutely beautiful. Smooth and tasty. 
15477,1154893,"Very nice. Rich, mild in sweetness"
15478,1154893,"I'll be the first to admit that this is very early days for the 2011 vintage ports. This one is very pleasant and not overly powerful, leading me to believe that it's shelf life will not be as long as some of the other brands. Dark purple color with a ruby brim. Intense licorice and blackberries on the nose. The taste is  bit.muted so the licorice overwhelms. Aftertaste is rather limited. "
15479,1154893,"🍷Colour: Deep tawny 👃🏻Nose: Dark berries, warm and alcohol. 👅Mouth: Dark and Powerful round and full-bodied with wonderful sweetness and light acidity. Good long dark and sweet aftertaste of dark berries, brown sugar, alcohol and fine tannins.  A lot of sediment so pour slowly 😜"
15480,1154893,"Reached that point in an evening when port is needed, however should probably have held off opening this. Some fig aromas and taste, with bags of fruit and acidity but it’s still raw…would be banging in a few years I’m sure. Went well with the cheese course unsurprisingly "
15481,1154893,"Very tasty old port, some wood and chocolate"
15482,1154893,Amazing with cheese and a drunken Christmas afternoon 
15483,1154891,"Dried fruits, nutty, citrusy zest, caramel and light tobacco "
15484,1154891,"Super smooth and syrupy, lighter color tawny."
15485,1154891,"Again awesome, a Colheita Tawny. Well-balanced and nuanced; just short the 1981 Kopke one: 4.25-4.5"
15486,1154891,"Very powerful fig, caramel, toffee, wood, vanilla, toasted wood, raisin. Very very delicious!  Powerful, fig and toffee, caramel, prune and black giant raisin, wood and vanilla. Super dense flavor and extract. Fresh midpalate balancing the above medium sugar.  Long densely flavorful and fresh finish with notes of prune, fig, raisin and toffee. Very very good! 95"
15487,1154891,"Initially A bit off on the palate with a green note luckily followed by apricot, cane sugar as well as raisins and candied orange peel. Not well balanced. 84 points."
15488,1154891,No notes taken.
15489,1154891,Nice and dry like a sherry
15490,1154891,Great young colheita from Andresen. Will be a great one in 10/20 years time
15491,1154891,"Beautiful Colheita Port! Dark mahogany color, oxydized nose with plum and tobacco notes. Brilliant palate, complex and powerful, round, smooth and very very long. I love Port !"

15493,1154891,"4.7 this is something special, tawny port from a vintage year. Incredible wine with pale color and so much going on. Must try "
15494,1154891,"Rich and creamy with presence, power, complexity and wonderful length."
15495,1154891,"Pale brown color. Dried fruits aroma with notes of tobacco. In the mouth delicious and smooth, with hints of nuts and caramel. Long and pleasant final."
15496,1154891,"[Port Master Class] WOTN for me! Colheita sometimes lives in the shadow of Vintage port but in this case I enjoyed this one most. Smoky and earthy nose with prune and cinnamon followed by a smooth palate with beautiful acidity, integrated tannins, constructive spicyness and a fantastic finish. Effortless quality, this one! 4.2"
15497,1154891,"A vintage port with a garnet colour. In the nose there’s not the typical dried fruits but some cocktail cherries and a more fresh approach, something floral too... Intense fruity flavours. Cherries, the good old fashioned trail mix and a little wood which is gently integrated. In the end a little bitter touch hiden between the sweet aromas, coming from old lost tannin. So good, so distinct, so round, so symbiotic....nice! 4,2⭐️ "
15498,1099392,Final instalment at Mrs A’s b’day dinner at Odette earlier this week. Vintage Port.   1992... a year with many memorable moments.  Incredible smoothness. Raisin. Plum. Great balance and velvety mouthfeel. Eternal finish.   And my first Single Quinta Vintage Port ✅ here
15499,1099392,"The other night we finished this bottle! Nothing wrong with this 24 year old vintage Port. Dark ruby and purple color, beautiful raisin and berry nose. Deep flavor profile with berries and grape layered with nutmeg and cinnamon. Glad I still have a few bottles set aside!"
15500,1099392,Still very young and fresh.  Another 10-20 depending on your taste.
15501,1099392,Classic.  LOTS of sediment 
15502,1099392,"Nose: Classic dusty Vintage. Mouth: Sugar, alcohol, barrel. A fine taste."
15503,1099392,"First wet cement, then cereals growing into British Barley Wine. Later lavender and honestly a little vulgar..."
15504,1099392,"Incredible.  Dark fruit, smooth, black cherry, medium sweet, aged raspberry, blackberry"
15505,1099392,"Very young port ! Very fresh. Maby a Shame to open it, but I needed to taste it. Waiting with the other bottles. Who knows how long I should wait with the next one. Please address me."
15506,1099392,"Aromas of prune, figs, dark fruit, marmalade, soft and elegant in the mouth, long and delicious finish. ADORO. Pour me another one!"
15507,1099392,Quite possibly one of the best dessert wines I've had. Strong dark chocolate notes which makes this very rich. Wish I had a cigar.
15508,1099392,"Still beautiful and dark red colour, a lot of blackberry, vanilla, oak tobacco, light complimentary sweetness and a little alcohol at opening. Not as perfectly harmonious as the 1994 but absolutely stunning glass. The cork is immaculate and looks like it was put in a little while ago. After a few hrs you get a more complex wine with more body and complexity and a floral finish (violet). "
15509,1099392,"🔠 👁‍🗨 week 🍷 👁‍🗨uinta do Vesuvio vintage port 👁‍🗨 is always the hardest.  4.3* Love fortified wines, but notably Port makes me really drunk so I should be careful when I drink. This one almost knocked me out.  Opaque ruby. Liquid velvet with black cherry, plum, black currant, chocolate, leather. Sweet, tart acidity, mouth-coating persistent tannins. Powerful."
15510,1099392,Looking Forward To Taste This Port. Anyone @ Vivino Who Can Suggest Right Age To Pop This 1994...?
15511,1099392,A legend. Seems 15 years younger. Still tense and vibrant. Not at its peak. I would let it rest a further 10 years to say the least. But how delicious it is right now!

15513,7396312,"A hidden gem from Douro. Dark fruit, vanilla, honey. An awful lot of grapes in here besides Touriga Nacional, difficult to place the taste."
15514,7396312,"This is one of those cases where you don’t find anything special but yet it’s good and enjoyable, either by itself or with some black pork belly.  👃 well balanced, doesn’t not reveal himself to much, vanilla , blueberry, it also gives a hint of earthy notes.  🍷 sweet, dry ( it gives you that feeling as if the wine quickly disappears in your mouth), well balanced, weak tannins and medium acidity."
15515,7396312,nice and good very affordable quality price one of the best !!
15516,7396312,"Fruity, excellent choice "
15517,7396312,One of the best wines I've ever tasted for the price of it. 
15518,7396312,"Cherry, Blackcurrant, plum.. Lots of tannins but in good way, lots of vanilla. Long finnish. Slighty to acidic (for my teaste). Leather.  Very good wine, needs time to aeration! ⭐4.3!"
15519,7396312,A heavy red with lots of dark fruit like black currant and plum and an lovely of oak and leather. An earthy wine that wants to be paired with roast meats; would finish the bottle but with food. 
15520,7396312,"Very nice, dark fruit and good acidity, well integrated tannins "
15521,7396312,"Very dark and purple; lovely coloring. Plum, violet, forest floor; like heavy air topped off with vanilla. Really enjoyed this overlooking the water in Porto. "
15522,7396312,"Dark fruits with hint of porto on the nose, balanced and so juicy with nice tanins, beautiful! Definitely will buy again!"
15523,7396312,"4,1⭐Great old wines from Douro. 👀Vivid ruby red. Abundant tears. 👃Intense and quite fruity, blackberry, plum, blueberry, black cherry, oak and leather. 👅Balanced, medium-full body, really dry. Well integrated tannins with medium-high acidity. 🏁Medium-long finish with a bit of astringency. 🗒️At least 30min of aeration please. 😃 Nose promises a bit more, still is great wine delivering very well. Think it can still evolve in the cellar."
15524,7396312,"🇵🇹 very dark, almost black. Mildly dry and rather on the acidic side. Dark fruit palate, including black cherry, and some cherry with oak. Long finish with strong tannins. Decent wine, but not a 4.4. Cheers!"
15525,7396312,"My second red wine in Porto, full body, dry, earth and fruits, very balanced, Douro bordering 4.5"
15526,7396312,What a lovely wine. Beautifully structured and smooth. Not high in tannins albeit full bodied. 
15527,7396312,"Blackcurrent , oak, acidic, good but I expected a more herby wine."
15528,1157592,"Viva Portugal 1...  Powerfull and complex Douro red blend. Nose shows lots of dark berries, plum sauce and dark cherry. Also dark chocolate, salty licorice, fresh asphalt, glue, woodsmoke, limestone, flowers, vanilla, barbecue and meditarean herbs. All this is constantly shifting with more air and increasing temperature. The finish is very fruity and long with graphite, wood and coffee allusions. Great elegant tannin but lots of red current acidity. Would love to revisit in 5 y. 18,5/20."
15529,1157592,Full bodied. Too tannic for my taste but still a good wine! I used to have it in the past and i had a better opinion about it. Its still a good wine.  Encorpado. Muito taninico para o meu gosto mas mesmo assim e um bom vinho. Tinha una opiniao melhor mas penso que este 2014 nao e dos melhores anos.
15530,1157592,"Powerful red blend from Douro. It is a bold wine, with floral notes and a lot of dark forest fruits with some spices and well integrated oak. Still young with high tannins. Need decantation - 1h at least for a magnum bottle. Long finish. 4.1pts  "
15531,1157592,"A dark, bold and complex wine with floral notes, dark forest fruits and liquorice.  Lovely tannins that linger. "
15532,1157592,"Very fresh, floral notes,elegant and trilling mouthfeel"
15533,1157592,"Very smooth, rich and fruity.  Great value, very enjoyable wine."
15534,1157592,"Had a Magnum of the carm! Great wine. Dark fruits, pretty long and quite soft for this age. "
15535,1157592,"Good Tinto - dark ripe plum, dark cherry, spice - good full bodied drop."
15536,1157592,Nice and full-bodied red with excellent red fruits and good amount of wood. Very nice with red meats! 
15537,1157592,"Uplifting red, like the first flowering shrubs in spring.  Dark chocolat, red currants, black fruit, underbush and nutmeg carried by a persistant acidity. Juicy at day 1, improves in balance the following days. Not very complex.    15€ is a bit overpriced imo"
15538,1157592,"Great wine. Deep color, well balanced "
15539,1157592,Heavy my guy
15540,1157592,Holy moly this is some great stuff. On the WE top 100 list and I understand why. Complex flavours and tannic bite. Still young but already performing.
15541,1157592,"Lots of alcohol on the nose, but not present on the palate. Really dark fruit and  and some earthiness. Great long smooth finish with dried fruits."
15542,1157592,Excellent quality wine. Flavourish and excellent with meat
15543,1157592,Holy moly this is some great stuff. On the WE top 100 list and I understand why. Complex flavours and tannic bite. Still young but already performing.
15544,1157592,"Exactly as expected, with perhaps a bit more acidity--which ended up working well with our somewhat-fatty filet mignons. Traditional Douro grapes--with traditional Douro fruits--at the proper Douro age. Give it some airtime for a beautifully-wooded bouquet. It’s not dense or complex enough for a special score, but it’s quite on—and varietally satisfying. Drink this 2015 up now. 3.9 woofs. What a pretty nose at the end of the night."

15549,1157592,"Outstanding, it sustains in the mouth longer than usual."
15550,1157592,"Fruity and fresh. Good acidity. Notes of citrus grapefruit, apricot and green apple. Good balance. Long finish.  Frutado e fresco. Boa acidez. Notas citrico, toranja e maca verde e damasco. Equilibrado e final longo."
15551,1157592,"Medium body, high tannin red wine with lots of cherry notes, some red to dark fruits, a bit smokey. Pleasant finish. Great with salty dishes (aka Portuguese meat dishes :))"
15552,1157592,"This is an interesting one.  It’s big.  It’s lopsided in the way Paso Robles wines are.  But it has the earthiness of a French wine.  Dark fruit.  Probably won’t buy again, but glad to have met your acquaintance, dear wine."
15553,1157592,"Red blend from Douro: Touriga National, Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Francisca. Selection of the best grapes from the Douro Superior. Aged in used american and french oak barrels.  Bright ruby red. Nose of cherry and and forest fruits.  Intense and concentrated. Complex flavor of red and black fruits. Dark plum. Restrained alcohol.  3,7"
15554,1157592,"Not quite ripe, a little a little acidity. Simple on nose and palate but not bad. Easy drinking but nothing amazing."
15555,1157592,Full body but light to drink. Notes of vanilla and raspberry. Needs a little air to produce a full flavor. 
15556,1157592,"One of my favourite wines. 2015 is not the best year for it, though."
15557,1157592,"ES88 RP89. Equal mix of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca & Tinta Roriz grapes 🍇"
15558,1210513,"Appearance: deep purple red colour  Nose: very expressive nose with aromas of red and dark fruits with hints of oak  Palate: full bodied , high acidity and firm tannins  showing notes of black cherries, sour cherries, raspberries and sweet oak"
15559,1210513,"Very dark colour. Vanilla, berries and red wine. Taste not so sweet but satisfying. Clove - fig. - etc. Goes well with cheddar."
15560,1210513,"Good blend from Douro Valley. Black  fruits, vanilla, violets and some oak. Well balanced & round tannins. A pleasant red wine for everyday."
15561,1210513,Sitting next to the door on the label. A bacalao lunch with Isabel from Symington. Beautiful red fruit. Fresh acidity. Full bodied. Lovely minerality easy tannins 1/3
15562,1210513,Deep red color with light dark fruit nose. Definitely sense the Touriga Nationale upfront. Smooths out with a nice lingering finish. Good with red meat. 
15563,1210513,"Medium purple color. Dark cherry jam, broad oak, blueberry, plum, little bit earth, soft tannins, medium acidity, long lingering, little tingling finish. Delicious nose. "
15564,1210513,Very nice typical blend from Douro. Not harsh as some are and not overly extracted. This is a nice well made blend that combines complexity and medium structure. Not a Chrysea or a Crasto Vinhas Velhas but still a good soft Douro
15565,1210513,Facinating red from Portugal’s Port region Douro. This Touriga blend (Nacional and Franca) with a bit of Tinta Amarela has a very dark red purplish hue. Nose is earthy and forest cedar. Lots of fresh red fruit surrounded by smoke and supported by very pleasant tannins. Length is good and fresh. A great find and yet another example of how varied wine is. 
15566,1210513,"Final wine of blends v single varietals with a@[1|7459024|Scottoz], @[1|29011840|Mr Kevvy] & @[1|21994377|- Dan -] This is the blend of my 2nd pairing and is 70% Touriga Nacional, 25% Touriga Franca & 5% Tinta Amarela.  This red is smoky with dark berry fruit, (non peppery) spice & some sous-bois. Closest of all of my 4 Portuguese still wines to a Port flavour profile (obviously without the sweetness).  At 4.2⭐️, this represents another wine for the blends which won out 3-2 overall."
15567,1210513,Beautifully aromatic. Inky purple plum and blackberry bomb. Rustic and forest notes. Earthy and a touch herbal. Dusty minerality. Smooth and silky texture. Oak presence and a little vanilla. Dark fruit lingering palate.
15568,1210513,A great wine to enjoy in the Algarve. Rich dark fruit flavours with hints of vanilla and leather. Very dry with some tannins around with makes it a great accompaniment to the bbq steak we had. With soft alcohol on the the finish it makes it perfect with food.
15569,1210513,Retasting Dark colour; purple rim Medicinal herbs on the nose Dark fruit and minerals in the taste; pepper
15570,1210513,A straight 4. Delicious as it stands and will surely migrate even higher in the next 3/5 years. Great wine
15571,1210513,"Nice dark purple color...  Red berries, cinnamon, chocolate and vanilla... Good tannins with long ending..."
15572,1210513,Sorry. No notes of this one but very enjoyable red with lots of power but also soft mouthfeel. Cheers
15573,1157592,"3,8 wine with character-vanilla,chocolate,plums,blackberries,full-bodied,round tannins"
15574,1157592,4* for 2018. Delicious vanilla choco decent oaky. M body acidity.

15576,1157592,"Nice deep ruby color. Black fruits, plum, blackberry and a lot of oak influence, vanilla, chocolate, and accompanied by spices like licorice and cinnamon. Quite strong but balanced tannins, a bit acidic and full bodied with a long finish. Staged 18 months in oak casks."
15577,1157592,Holy moly this is some great stuff. On the WE top 100 list and I understand why. Complex flavours and tannic bite. Still young but already performing.

15579,1157592,"Good Reserva from Douro region. In the nose lots of dark ripe fruits, plum and spices. Slightly sharp (alcohol) in the nose as well. On the palate clearly round and much more smooth than expected. High intensity, with plum and vanilla (18 months on oak). Typical from this region, but on the other side more smooth than other Douro’s. For sure a good quality Tinto. "
15580,1157592,"Deep ruby red color, dry wine and smooth tannines. Ripe plum, blackberries, floral tones, vanilla. Aged 18 months on mix of French and American oak, which reflects in the smell and taste. Taste red cherry, blackberries and plum, some hints of chocolate. Great Portugese wine and an easy drinker"

15583,1157592,"Smoke, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, plum"
15584,1157592,Full body black fruits 
15585,1157592,Delicious with dark fruit and a dry finish
15586,1157592,"Smoke and licorice, dry wine with medium tannins. "
15587,1157592,"Very enjoyable Douro! Has a good, robust mouth feel but more subtle than, say, a Ribera del Duero. Earthy and dark fruit like plum or prune come to mind. Would definitely like to try more Douro, given how much I enjoy Spanish Tempranillo."
15588,3334065,"Old vines and granite soils. Blend of indigenous varieties, including Malvasia, Encruzado and Bical Fermented in concrete tanks and aged in old oak barrels for 20 months with no batonage  Light gold colour On the nose, citrus, acacia flowers, honey, wet stone minerality  Vibrant and lively, but with a weighty and creamy mouthfeel Hint of smoke Green apples, quince, honey Lemon zest, white grapefruit  Herbal Touch of raw almonds  Lots of steely minerality  Long, pithy finish  Delicious!"
15589,3334065,"Mineral, earthy, herbal, fruity and complex."
15590,3334065,"A delicious blended white wine from the Dão. Citrusy colour with scents of kiwi, peach and pineapple. Mineral but a slightly buttery texture and fresh. Balanced acidity and subtle fruits rounds it all out. Highly recommended! Saúde!"
15591,3334065,"Dry, light and slightly acidic. Citrus lemon notes that give the wine a very nice freshness. Not a favorite but not too bad either."
15592,3334065,"3.9*, at Brasserie Julie. Nice and dry. Matched with some Belgian caviar to celebrate our son’s 16th birthday. The sommelier actually initiated him in tasting wine ! "
15593,3334065,Golden yellow color with a summer fruit nose like pear and fig. Mineral start with a nice dry finish. Pairs with all seafood especially with crustaceans. Also great as an aperitif in the summer
15594,3334065,"It’s been too long since my last Niepoort and this didn’t disappoint! Solid 4* (RP92)  Old vines (~100yr)  Aromatic and somewhat fruit forward. Good depth. Blackberry and bramble. Peppery spice.  H acidity. M+ tannins. Long tail and slightly mouth-drying, but still delish."
15595,3334065,"Fresh and elegant, next to maturing on oak. In combination with ravioli of Portugese sheap cheese, spinach and sage butter a wonderful combination."
15596,3334065,"Elegant with fresh aromas of citrus, grapefruit with subtle oak aromas and vibrant acidity. Very nice bottle evolution and pleasant fresh finish"
15597,3334065,"3.9! La Grande Dégustation de Montréal! Very interesting Portuguese white that made think of the Loire Valley!  Minerals, lemon, saline, melon and pear all around. Medium finish. Very good."
15598,3334065,"I really liked that one, the nose gave me riesling vibe, you get petroleum and a loooot of lemon on the nose, but then the texture is huge with a smooth mouthfeel and a lovely finish"
15599,3334065,"Very well structured. Dry and austere to begin with, but new flavours of tropical fruit emerge followed by fig and chestnut. Enjoyable. "
15600,3334065,Nice at the taverna of Baleal 
15601,3334065,"Enjoyed it! Fresh and elegant. Medium high acidity but well balanced by a well matured, elegant, fruit. Followed a Lampreia very very well!"
15602,3334065,"What a nice Niepoort! Elegant yet bold. Quite opaque and deep red. Loads o earth, leather. And yet fresh with apples. Long, pleasant taste. Bought on sale and well worth the money."
15603,1300960,"Bery pale gold color, ripe apple, pear, medium aftertaste with hint of minerality, vanilla, light butter. Nice, but I am missing some more acidity. 3.8"
15604,1300960,"🇵🇹 Ótimo vinho Alentejano, vestido amarelo dourado brilhante, olfato fruta cítrica e branca, ananás, maçã e pêra, detalhes minerais, caramelo e flor de laranjeira, palato encorpado, elegante, fresco, untuoso e acidez correta, final longo e delicioso.   🇬🇧 Great Alentejo wine, bright golden yellow dress, citrus and white fruit nose, pineapple, apple and pear, mineral details, caramel and orange blossom, full-bodied palate, elegant, fresh, unctuous and correct acidity, long and delicious finish. "
15605,1300960,"Very solid, vivid white blend of Arinto, Antao Vaz, Assario, Tamarez, Roupeiro.  L: dense yellow, pretty viscous at abv.13%. N: white flower, sour yellow plum, pear. Mineral (limestone), buttery notes. Hints of honeycomb, lime peel.  P: med (+) bodied, moderate though lively acidity, buttery, dry. Mineral, savory finale&med.long, refreshing aftertaste. No.1 choice for shashlik (seasoned pork BBQ). Enjoyable sole. 4 points from our summer terrace. "
15606,1300960,"Good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (citrus, apple) and woody. However, it has a very intense fruity / floral (violet?) note, something flourishing, which, lately, is emerging in many Portuguese wines (reds and and whites) from north to south (which I don't like very much). But in the sensorial dimension it`s a pleasant wine from Alentejo. Contains sulfites. Alcohol in the level 13,5.°."
15607,1300960,"Pleasant white to start the tasting at Cartuxa, but still a bit too young. On the nose, quite balanced aromas of citrus, tropical fruit, a nice oaky backdrop and some herbal hints. However still a bit unstructured on the palate, with nice acidity but packing too much punch and dominant spicy notes that just smoothen in a buttery finish. Would love to revisit in a few years. "
15608,1300960,Pale yellow. Pineapple nose. Fruity and fresh in the mouth 🇵🇹
15609,1300960,"Good, many flavours and very complex. Long end with grass and prune. Pear and tropical on the nose."
15610,1300960,"Citrus tones in the nose and also some ash/mineral notes. Big body, vanilla fresh acids and butter that hits you at the first sip. Then som honey and elderberry and less of citrus. Slightly oxidated in a good and elegant way. "
15611,1300960,"One of my favourite whites. Mid bodied, velvety tannins, dry and high but balanced acidity. A very fresh wine. Great structure. Full bouquet of pear, green apple, lime, minerals along with a big mouth presence."
15612,1300960,"Really delightful white wine with a balance of flavours, minerality and body. The arinto and antão vaz grapes impart a range of citrus notes but for me it was the hints of green apple that were most prominent. A fabulous wine to pair with my aged presunto from Barrancos. Saúde!"
15613,1300960,"Great white wine from Alentejo, Portugal, bought at my Friend’s @Joao Passos wineshop Louro wines in Évora. Limpid clear yellow color with pale green reflexes. Discreet nose of green apple, pineapple & lime wrapped in mineral notes. In mouth, ellegant & mouthfeeling, fresh & refreshing, average body in perfect harmony with its acidity delivering delicious mineral fruit flavors honoring nose. Good lasting gifting remarkable pineapple aftertaste. Paired wonderfully with codfish “portuguese style”. Cheers!"
15614,1300960,"Dey, minerals, dry grass, hints of tropical fruit, yellow apples. Very well balanced, fresh and not full body. Light yelow. Light in the nose. "
15615,1300960,"A good one. Serious, medium bodied but with presence. Crispy but not fruity.  A little bitterness in the palate and a hint of pineapple in the aftertaste.  Worthy!"
15616,1300960,"🌍🍇  Excellent Portuguese Souththern white (Alentejo) made from a blend of four grapes. 💪👀  Medium-bodied and pale lemon color 👃 Intense on the nose with notes of green apple, citrus and minerals. 👅 Palate is dry and fresh with balanced acidity and great finish. 💰 Great RPQ."
15617,1300960,Cycled to Évora and had this. Dream meal and wine after a hot day. Fucking loved it   Second bottle on the way 
15618,2816727,"It’s very difficult to find in Portugal many Wineries where are planted international grapes varieties like Syrah but one of the regions when the terroir allows this is Bairrada... where the climate is quite similar. Nice Syrah, expressive and elegant "
15619,2816727,Aged 40 months in oak! Oak on the nose but not too much. Big red fruit jam to start then cherry finish. 
15620,2816727,Intense. Structed. Balanced tannin
15621,2816727,"Light and fruity. Quite ""summery"" in character."
15622,2816727,"Excellent example of Baga from the great Nierpoort who dominates Douro and has bought this Quinta in the Bairrada. Great attack, great acidity, complex, long close to a GC Burgundy. Worth the try "
15623,2816727,"Bagaboom! Bairrada used to be Portugal’s underdog terroir, now it’s on everyone’s lips. The local Baga grape tastes like a fusion of Pinot Noir and Nebbiolo. Boom!  Gripping nose of mushroom, clove, raspberry, violet, rose hip and truffle. Precise, refreshing palate of strawberry, black cherry, tar, tobacco leaf, anise, leather and white pepper slowly fading out as wood smoke. Elastic tannins, low alcohol. Understated power, this Baga draws attention with its elegant structure and deep minerality. Bagaboom!"
15624,2816727,"I had a coup de coeur for this red wine, super elegant bitterness coupled with profond cherry fruit taste."
15625,2816727,"A region and grape I am decidedly unfamiliar with, it was interesting to encounter something so Beaujolais-ish. Stemmy, with good structure.   Look in the corner and you can see this is from the fine folks at Niepoort. "
15626,2816727,"Caves Dão/ Bairrada/ Nelson. the most expensive of the night but not worth the price(375 R in Brazil). Black with little red halo. Jelly of Jaboticaba and fig at nose. Mouth doesn't follow the nose...Medium body ...Good persistence.  85pt.  Preto, com pequeno halo vermelho; Geléia de jaboticaba e figo - nariz elegante. Boca náo consegue acompanhar o nariz. Caro demais. Beba já - se ganhar de presente."
15627,2816727,"If tasting blind, I would have thought this was a Burgundy. Very light, good amount of acidity and drinking very well. Amazing as I read that Baga grapes are tough and harsh."
15628,2816727,"A good amount of stable on the nose. Fruity and light l. Not too much depth, a bit too tangy for my taste"
15629,2816727,Smell sweet cocktail cherries dark smell  taste mineral fruits light feeling  after taste with tannins medium length
15630,2816727,89. A disappointment!
15631,2816727,Not my cup Of tea from Nieeport wine. Soft lacks of character of its cousins
15632,2816727,Wowserz we all loved this one. Red fruits and  lavender. A fine and delicate wine showing freshness all around. Nice round tannins complete the bill for an obviously special bottle when given price for quality. You will not want to stop at one glass. Pair with roasted duck breast.
15633,1201912,"I really need to decant this for a couple days to be fair. It’s young, herbaceous, licorice, extremely long finish. Not overly sweet. Has a bit of fruit tartness. See you in a couple days."
15634,1201912,Powerful nose with notes of cooked red fruits and berries plus some dried raisins. Long powerful palate on the same mature red fruits. Misses a bit of elegance and finesse but what power....
15635,1201912,No notes taken.
15636,1201912,"Had at port tasting, no notes "
15637,1201912,Blissful rich black currant with molasses finish which is rather successful.
15638,1201912,"Enormous sweetness, Velvet power and taste ! Like Amarone revisited. Need to mention, i am not a Port expert !"
15639,1201912,"This vintage port was pored right from the bottle, so it really appeared too young to drink. A bit sad."
15640,1201912,"Disappointing sweet an lack of structure. Unfortunately, I have another bottle. "
15641,1201912,What a Port. With some amazing cheese it was just a fantastic port wine. So want to try a magnum now.
15642,1201912,Could use 10 more years but very approachable for such a young wine. Balanced jammy fruit and smooth tannins.
15643,1201912,"A very good port. Excellent balance and refined. A wonderful combination of subtle flavors like raisins, plums, liquorice and lots more. It is the balance and subtlety that stands out. A very pleasant acidity to balance the sweet tones. Mmm."
15644,1201912,Last from the three vintage port bought at Winefields - now we taste 2003 - nicely full bodied - brown sugar fudge tones and loads of sweet spices like cinnamon. Alcohol fully integrated in a round palate. 
15645,1201912,"Clear, deep purple red with ruby rim, super slow tears. Clean, medium plus intensity nose, filled with stewed plums and raisins. Dry, full body, medium plus acid, medium tannins, more stewed plums and raisins ripe dark cherry, black currant, blackberry and blueberry, baking spices and black pepper. Medium finish."
15646,1201912,"Deep purple colour. Blackberry, black plum, blueberry, tobacco, licorice, dried plum, chocolate, mint, leather. Sweet with high acidity, tannins and alcohol, full body and long finish. 9,2 PM"
15647,1201912,Incredible Port with black currant and blackberries and sweet chocolate and tobacco taste. Vintage Ports are my favourite since I often prefer Ruby to tawny but can’t deny the aging.
15648,76429,"Very deep ruby color, 100 % Alicante Bouchet, very diffetent to 2017, much better, very ripe black cherry, black plum, very nice long aftertaste with hint of vanilla, and oak, but very light. Nice complex wine. 4.8."
15649,76429,"100% Alicante Bouchet, 36 month in oak and steel. Almost black in color and bone dry. long last aromas of dark fruits and berry, oak, smoke, and very balsamic. The tannins are well balanced in this vintage already but i assume you could store it for another 15 years. Excellent stuff, but surely no crowd pleaser."
15650,76429,"My allergies were in full force and couldn't smell a thing.  So getting some help on the notes here.  Pronounced jammy black fruit, blueberry, chocolate black pepper  Pronounced palate follows with hi ratings across structural elements.  Long finish "
15651,76429,"Profoundly dark red, thick and luscious, this wine has pronounced tannins and a wonderfully complex mouth. Chocolate, tobacco and hints of dark fruit. Beautiful acidity, medium finish, it is pretty incredible."
15652,76429,Lovely oak flavour with a full body
15653,76429,"4,85  This wine is named after the Santa Maria Scala Coeli monastery.  Tasting notes: Colour: Intense garnet  Aromas: Evident of toast, with notes of cocoa and ripe fruit afterwards, smells seductively of forest fruits.  Taste: Extremely full-bodied, luscious and voluminous, very well structured, at the same time powerful and elegant, full of race. The aromas that have already been sniffed unfold as wonderfully delicious nuances of taste.  The finish is delicious, long-lasting and opulent."
15654,76429,"This is a wine worth trying! Pronounced nice of black fruit, savory, chocolate and blueberries, vanilla, black pepper. Dry, high acidity, full body, high tannins, and long finish. Intense flavors that follow the nose and are very well integrates. A special wine "
15655,76429,"This is one of my favorites. Bold, creamy,full of simple complexities. Very good with meats. "
15656,76429,"For the scala coeli they choose each year a grape so the label stays the same but the wine is completely different. In 2014 they used 100% petit verdot. The nose is a bit restrained, it takes a while to develop. The pallet is more refined,  less heavy on the fruit. Adorable wine.."
15657,76429,"When bought had just been launched. Very good wine, not iconic as Pera Manca but still excelent. Very easy to drink , harmonic and light nose . Slightely overpriced but still very good "
15658,76429,"Ruby dark red. Nose of mocha, vanilla and decadent dark berries. Cherry with a touch of vanilla. Espresso and mocha. Wonderfully smooth tannins that round the mouth.  "
15659,76429,Petit Verdor. Not available every year. 9000 every year.bottled and produced by Fundacao Eugenio de Almeida.
15660,76429,"Very intense, blueberry and red fruits, toast and smoke but mainly fruit. Medium acidity, long finish, not cheap but a great wine!"

15665,76429,"4.7  This is the best Portuguese red I've tried yet.  Beautiful dark purple appearance.  Nose is fruity and elegant with hints of blackberry and oak.  Pallette is packed with vibrant dark fruit,  blackberry, oak,  tobacco a bit of dark chocolate.  This wine is well structured.    Be sure to decant well.  Lay this one down for some years for max potential.  Overall, this is a top quality wine that delivers a lovely experience.   "
15666,76429,"Long aging different grape variety from vintage to vintage, Violet colour, discrete aromas, balanced, full bodied with long astringent finish, chocolate taste. Simple taste but rich structure, very gastronomically versatile."

15779,1126473,"Floral and light red fruit aromas. Notes of black currant, caramel and spice. Lower acidity than one expects from Alentejo. Soft tannic structure. An elegant, well structured wine and for that it receives 4 stars. I was disappointed with the strength of the flavour, especially with the Syrah blend. Defiantly needs some cheese to bring the wine to life. For the price, I won’t be going back. "
15780,1126473,"Pretty much the same as the 2014 I've tasted in Belgium, just before travelling to Portugal, but with less tannin dominance. What's more, with the dish (meat in a cabbage leaf with beetroot sauce) it was superb."

15783,1126473,"I can say, O wow! That's pretty good wine. Confirmed that Alentejano region is becoming one of my beloved. I was very curious when was opening the bottle as price was good one. But to the point. Plummy colour on the glass. Nose? O my gosh, the nose is full of fruits of blackberry, cherry, blackcurrant, plum and blueberry. Not expected such palette of fruity smells combined with oak, vanilla and chocolate additionally. The palate followed the nose but a little toned and not so intensive. Bold, soft tannins. "
15784,1126473,"Black fruit, forest floor and oak in the nose. Full flavoured red with pepper and chocolate added to the long lasting taste."
15785,75987,"Such a complex, rich chocolatey wine.  For me its perfect balance of plum and blackberry, tannin and sweetness, lightness and body.  "

Slowly opens up to its grand mouthfeel, and a heavenly experience combined with its just appropriate sweetness"
15804,81431,Mineral. Peppery. Wild fruit. An enigma! How will it age

15806,81431,"99 points. Vintage 2019 opened in 2021. 👀The color is deep purple. 👃The nose is offering blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, oak and eucalyptus. 👅The palate is bold! Its offering blackberry, vanilla, baking spices, cloves and black currant. Long aftertaste! Keeps evolving! The tannin structure is amazing! A fast tasting at the quinta, not for long showed the wine with a little suttle nose but the palate is very complex. Medium tannins and high acid. "
15807,81431,95 pts. Dark Violet red. Rich dense komplex and concentrated dried figs and prune. Full rich textured body still a bit tannic but with huge potential. Very very long. Will last forever

15816,80415,What a year! Strong and beautiful tastes of prunes and spices. The alcohol and sweetness has already been tamed. This feels more aged than the 2000 tried recently.   Its up there with the best
15817,80415,"Dark red with purple rims, this oozes blueberry and blackberry jam, chocolate, spices. Tannins are fine and getting resolved, there is density, black and candied fruits, a hint of graphite, and persisting cocoa taste. Good acidity and mild heat , long finish."
15818,80415,"Dried fruits. Dry taste with perfect sweetnes. Tobacco, Licorise, plums. Starting to mature wonderfully."
15819,80415,"What a fabulous port, depth of flavor and elegance galore. "
15820,80415,Dark ruby. Bouquet of dried  black fruit raisin fig. Flavour profile to match with some spice and eucalyptus shining through. Superb. 
15821,80415,"Second time that I drink a Port vintage wine! The first one didn’t impressed, but this one one perfect, for one that was used almost to tawny 20 years port, this One Came to open not only the eyes but the palate to vintage port!"
15822,80415,"Great vintage port. Garnet colour, non-fruit characteristics such as forest floor liquorice and caramel."
15823,80415,"Nice, but woody in finish - may be the bottle. Moderate aroma with cherry, figue&pear dominant. Full mouth of sugar, prune&pear. Powerfull&reach tannins as producer says... )"
15824,80415,This was absolutely marvellous with Roquefort and Stilton.
15825,80415,Not a ton of experience with port.  But solid for the style. 
15826,80415,Very nice purchased in 2003
15827,80415,"Oh, my wow!!! "
15828,80415,Grest potential for further storage. Young vibrant fruity character 
15829,80415,"Found this at the bar in Ballyseede Hotel in Tralee. Smooth, elegant and full of flavourful but bit sure how long it had been decanted."
15830,1126473,"Hint of spice,  dark fruits,  pungent yet smooth.."
15831,1126473,"Medium tanins, rounded, velvet on mouth. Red fruits, spices from wood. Very nice alentejano wine."
15832,1126473,Good wine. Nothing more.
15833,1126473,"Dark ruby. ripe fruit. open nose. herby. palate of ripe wild berries ,dry fruit and floral notes.  smooth mid and late palate."
15834,1126473,"90 points - medium ruby; nose of rubber, oak, sweet cigar; taste of cassis and licorice. Full body. Medium finish. Smooth wine."
15835,1126473,"Red ripe fruit aroma with some oak notes. Full bodied, round in the mouth and persistent tannis. Very good aftertaste. Recommend wine 🍷 "
15836,1126473,Deep ruby red. Smells almost port like. Dark fruits continue into the taste.   Heavy wine once aired. Balanced acidity.   A tad dry for me but it’s a good quality wine
15837,1126473,"Deep ruby color, concentrated with complex aroma of ripe black fruits (blackberries, blueberries and plums), subtle oak nuances, round, silky and mature tannins. Long and velvety aftertaste"
15838,1126473,"Likeable Portuguese, nice deep red colour and good nose. Slightly sweet, smokey and notes of plum and pepper. Fine glass to the price and the slight sweet tinge is perfect for those not to keen on prevalent tannins. All in all I liked it."
15839,1126473,"Very fruity, soft tanins, full body, deep colour with brownish rim. Dominates American oak vanilla flavour which will get stonger and stronger because other flavours are declining. Generaly surprisingly good for this price. I wouldn't keep it for more than 3 years  Acid is alreay low, tanins soft - this wine is not designed for decades. Drink now - now it's nearly perfect."
15840,1126473,"Full rounded white with vanilla and toasty almond notes, could use a touch more acidity, perhaps by adding a big of Arinto. The vegetal notes of the Verdelho are apparent and balance well the heavier structure of the Viognier and antao vaz."
15841,1126473,Very nice and well balanced for every day drinking.  Medium bodied.   oak blackberry cherry and raspberry come to mind.  
15842,1126473,"Dark colour, medium body. Aroma of blackberry fruit and oak. Smooth and fruity, and very drinkable once opened up."
15843,1126473,"3.8, more purple in glass, some prune and cherry on nose, in palate smooth great with pork ribs at Cantina 32 in Porto!"
15844,1126473,An Alentejo wine that I really appreciate. Ripe black fruit and earth aromas. Strong body and round tanines. Long final.

15847,1222725,I picked up a few bottles for a good weekday red wine. I taste raspberries and strawberries and the tannins are well balanced. 
15848,1222725,"Beautiful fruit but tannin is too extreme. Raspy, hoarse dried out nose, but perfect with burgers "
15849,1222725,"(EN) Slightly fresh with a nice touch of pepper and spices.  (PT) Um vinho fresco com notas de frutos silvestres e especiarias. Pronto para consumo imediato, é um vinho generoso com taninos suaves."
15850,1222725,"Follows a great release of Prazo, the 2014, and is less than one year! It shows already a great personality and is drinking well although will surely be much better in a few months. Juicy, full of dark plums, great concentration, good medium long finish but always smooth and balanced"
15851,1222725,"This is a beautiful blend of several local Douro varieties (and touring nacional playing only a supporting role) with lovely ripe black fruit aromas and plenty of black cherry on a long, well-balanced finish. Wonderfully eclectic wine."
15852,1222725,"RL = 3.8 (my rate) and VV=4.0 From the famous Portuguese region of Dão comes this mix: Touriga Franca/Nacional, Tinta Roriz  👁Dark Ruby with. 👃Very complex ripe fruit spectrum red & black: Plums, BlackBerry, strawberry, blueberry, cherries and gooseberry. 💋 repeat the 👃 with robust tannins in balance to the ripe fruits layers and spices: black pepper, cloves. 3rds notes of  Vanilla, tobacco and wet oak. 👚Robust 💫 Pleasant passage with spices prevalence ⏰Long stay...and a medium aftertaste  "
15853,1222725,"Deep crimson colour. Medium intensity nose of sweet red fruit. Palate is dry, high tannins, medium acidity, medium bodied, nice ripe red cherry and raspberry fruit, hint of vanilla. Good length. Very good."
15854,1222725,Inky purple color. Black fuits and smoky tannis on nose. It's a blend of the Touriga's  and Tinta's   of the region.  A big bold complex Douro red yet subtle and elegant at the same time. Black fruits well integrated with tannins   herby and tobacco tones as well. Love it and it went so well with our Italian food at Anella's in Belo. Will get better.
15855,1222725,"Dark ruby color. Tobacco and leather on palate. Bold, medium to high tannins and acidity. Strong alcohol. Dark berries and cherry on palate with oak notes. Decent wine without particular sophistication. "
15856,1222725,"Delicious dark Portuguese red. My favorite characteristic is the tangy, zingy spiciness you get on agood one. Just great for this one. The fruit is lingonberry and blueberry mix. Slightly translucent but dark. The nose slight fruit and alcohol. Mineral content is not at the forefront but adds to the tang. A taster for sure and closeout at Fred Meyer half price."
15857,1222725,"A very lovely blend of 7 Portuguese grapes with fantastic deep purple red colour. Very intense aromas of cherries, plums, blueberries & delicate spices. Also on the palate very intense, layers of different fruity, spicy & subtle sweety concentrated flavours. It's a complex, well structured wine with great balance, silky and soft round tannins. All these flavours fully fill the mouth  with pure pleasure which lead to pronounced finish and savourty aftertaste. Much better then vintage '10. So, drink it young."
15858,1222725,"A decent quaff, & a rebuy at this price.  A blend of Touriga Franca & Touriga Nacional from the famed Duoro region.  Deep ruby. Med aromatics with buttery leather, black cherry, & charred oak. Dry, full body, med+ tannins, med acidity, med finish. Palate is black fruit forward with primarily black cherry & tobacco with little else.  A simple juicy quaff at the right price point!"
15859,1222725,Very good. Balanced with nice acidity and tannins. Long finish. Paired with sirloin and pepper sauce
15860,76382,"From the leftover table at Ouwerkerk this morning. Dried raisins, strawberries, tobacco and ultra smoooothhhh. My mother brought chocolate cake which went excellent with it. Excellent !!"
15861,76382,"18.5/20. Seems to be older. Sauer cherry in chocolate, sweet plums in chocolate, sweet dry apricots, light alcohol. Very balanced sweetness and acidity. Many fruits, berries and tobacco on the palate. Great porto."
15862,76382,very njce and ballanced but a little alcohollic
15863,76382,"Bad cork , yet the flavours and alchool are still strong"
15864,76382,Fine compliment to cigar
15865,76382,"A bit sweet,  but taste together with cheese"
15866,76382,92/100 Basalmic and more savory for a Port. Full of red fruit and herbal notes. It's more of a medium body in style compared to other vintage Ports. Long finish. 
15867,76382,Great Port. Nice fruity nose with raisins and honey. Complex palate with dried raisins. Nice sweetness. Well balanced. Very very nice. 
15868,76382,3.8 👀 Intense ruby red color  👃  raisin leather cheese tobacco chocolate red fruit almond caramel cherry  👅 Med.- acidity  High alcohol  Full bodied

15870,76382,"Really nice Vintage Porto, Happy new year🍾🍾"
15871,76382,"Very good, a lot of tastes in this"
15872,76382,"Medium light ruby colour with a light orange hue. Raisin nose. Medium light acid and low smooth tannins with flavours of red currant, raisin, currant, sultana and fig. Lovely stuff "
15873,76382,"Ethereal bouquet of spices, x-mas spices, creme brulee, rancio and woody nuances. Super!  Incredibly well balanced with notes of nuts, dried fruit, caramel, x-mas spices. Very big taste with great complexity. Over medium sugar. Very very delicious indeed! I had not expected such awesome showing for this brand. Wow! 96"
15874,76382,90 points. Vintage 2000 opened in 2020. Perfect balance but still a young gun with lots of power and fruit. Lacking the depth some vintage wines gain with age but indicates it will be good in 10-20 years time. 
15875,45454,"""DRINK RATHER THAN SIP""  Who am I to argue with Rupert Symington? Their family is responsible for one of the greatest Duoro vintages of all time here! Father Peter, 6 time fortified wine maker of the year, produced this. An astounding history from 1820 to present!  Layers & subtlety! Insane brilliant color! Perfume and black raspberry give you rich sweetness, velvet tannins with firm but delicate brooding power. World class with a smoldering finish for weeks.  Perfect harmony like angels singing!"
15876,45454,"Still dark red. Wonderful long, long taste of marzipan, sweet cherrys. Still the best!  Tasted again in october. Liquid marzipan. Fantastic."
15877,45454,"Fabulous! Light in color, with caramel. Sweetness that lingers. Honey, toasted nuts. Vanilla. Gorgeous port from a wonderful year!"
15878,45454,"Another great elegant aged vintage, a bit more solar profile, plummy, rich, burned cigar notes, spicy character - a nice wine "
15879,45454,"This port is a great, delicious after dinner drink with a sumptuous, luscious mouthfeel, with smooth taste and tannins. One of my favorites.  "
15880,45454,"Elements of a tawny or colheita. 45-year-old magnificence. Notes of Carmel. Even so, the 77 I believe is superior. This was part of a 14 bottle vertical toward tasting. Make my life"
15881,45454,"Normally I’m not a fan of tawny port, but time has buffeted the more harsh qualities to reveal a splendid digestif: leather, cigar box, and tobacco somehow with honey.  Celebrating a dear couple’s 50th wedding anniversary with joy!"
15882,45454,"Beautiful notes of mint, red plums, tobacco and chocolate. Lovely texture and very well balanced with alcohol well integrated into the wine. Stunning with the stuffing to go another 5-10 years with some more development. Perfect pairing with chocolate mousse cake. 95"
15883,45454,"Without hesitation the best wine I’ve had in 2020, tasted at Xmas. An absolute pleasure for me and my family, an unforgettable moment where it all comes together in the existence of a wine. Words would be superficial, the memory will be eternal. "
15884,45454,"Another fabulous Port experience! Bright, fresh and svelte. I truly enjoyed this as much as I did the recent Dow's 1977. Both wines could easily have passed for a 1994 or even 2000 because the freshness of its aromas and flavors really belied their age. I'm no expert of vintage ports but it's not far fetched to think this can go on another 30 years because of how well balanced and integrated it is. Just brilliant.  "
15885,45454,Pow! What a beauty. Drinking so well. Ever sip is pure joy. 
15886,45454,Great story behind this bottle
15887,45454,"Just perfect, nutty,plum,leather,"
15888,45454,"My year of birth, so always 5 stars!!!"
15889,45454,It amazes me how port such as things with outstanding quality has gone out of fashion. What an amazing wine I hope I never fall into some trends of wine fashion that would be a sin.
15890,1126473,"UNDERRATED !!!  So often Portuguese table wines are forgotten, especially in the states. Big mistake! Many like my Vivino wine friend @[1|2076745|Daro] have posted reviews of this and others, with great results!  So fresh and clean, this was EASY to drink. Dominating flavors of dried potpourri, black cherry, cedar & spice box. This will age nicely. 90 pts"
15891,1126473,"Spicy herbs, flavourful tannins, plums and some cherries. I made hamburgers yesterday and this one was a good choice together with that"
15892,1126473,Tannins very present. One of the best portuguese wines I have ever tasted. It was wonderful with cod. Bacalhau a Bela Cintra.
15893,1126473,"WIP.... tinto alentejano in Lisboa. Bom! Coupage: aragonez, alicante bouschet, touriga nacional and syrah. 9 months in French oak barrel. Good QPR."
15894,1126473,"Very well integrated taste, extremelly smooth, ligth lemon fruit. Great smooth aftertaste without any acid. Just miss more fruit flavor four perfection :) serve only chilled!"
15895,1126473,"Medium body, soft tannins, some high notes on acidity tho, medium dryness. Hints of chocolate, cherry, black currant, tobacco. The finish is interesting. A very pleasant red."
15896,1126473,"Reliable, very good 🇵🇹 Red offer and very good value! Pretty complex, elegant and smooth.Dark fruits,blackberries,blackcurrents,cherries, some plums with wood, chocolate,vanilla, leather and earth notes and delicate pepper. Midium to full body, rounded, soft tannins, good balance, pleasant, lingering smooth finish with subtle sweet and spicy accents. Always a pleasure to drink it! 3.8  Happy weekend everyone! 💪🍷🍷😎"
15897,1126473,"This is serious stuff! Profound dark plum colored robe, nose of some undergrowth and green pepper mixed with fruity notes. Mouth is complex, long lasting...with red fruit and hints of green pepper following with leathery finish. After a dinner last night with friends who love gamay, this wine puts my taste buds in a nearly catatonic state...and oh boy! they do enjoy it!!!!"
15898,1126473,"Takes a hell of a long time to loosen up (opened it on a Monday, worth drinking on Tuesday, magnificent by Wednesday) when it does, such a delight.  Initially tight, tannic, almost inky and then blooms into a soft pillow of rich blackberries."
15899,1126473,"This is a big-boy wine — robust, outsized flavors and a tongue-punch of tastes. Deep dark cherry, dried fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, leather, and earth. More than a tad of tannins. Definitely a meat-paired accompaniment. Bought on sale in a northern Portugal grocery store for under 10 €. "
15900,1126473,"The first smell was of damp socks. Some toasted notes, slightly peppery, something like the stone of plum or cherry. Rather complex with a satisfyingly full and very smooth body. A lot to take in, also because of a high alohol content of 14%. Good length. Surprisingly easy to drink though. I would have it on its own, maybe with some dark chocolate."
15901,1126473,"Charred plums, cherries and damson, with     plenty of oak and chewy leather, slight cocoa and vanilla notes"
15902,1126473,"Citrus fruits , some pineapple with good length and balanced acidity. Excellent with mackerel and sardines. "
15903,1126473,Medium to dark burgundy. Great fruity nose with good spice and pepper. Palate full and great finish. Very enjoyable.
15904,1126473,"Aragonez, Alicante Bouchet, Touriga Nacional, Syrah was 9 month in French oak, cherry nose, round, soft tannins, "
15905,1200518,Wife thought it was a bit tart. I personally loved it.  It's definitely full of citrus flavours and for me superbly easy drinking.
15906,1200518,"This alvarinho ho has been distinguished itself among several other vinho verde. Nice complexity, tipical green apple with nice and strong tropical fruits complement.  "
15907,1200518,"Pale yellow colour, ripe stone fruit nose. In mouth, a lovely wine. Fresh, crisp, nice balanced acidity, smooth  citrus, tropical fruits, salt and stone fruit notes. Medium finish, great fruity aftertaste. "
15908,1200518,"It’s always a pleasure to taste this great wine, an 100% Alvarinho made with passion for the grape variety and the terroir. Fresh, intense, elegant with pleasant acidity. Crispy and textured. Balanced with long fresh finish. "
15909,1200518,"Strong acacia nose and peach. Nice summer aromas, good alcohol for the acidity and strong and long alcohol. Fresh, apple, hay, peach and citrusy.  Chill it well :)"
15910,1200518,Just a slice of Portuguese sun. Fresh and crispy Alvarinho made by the master Anselmo Mendes.
15911,1200518,"Well, I will like to drink it in snow, outside 😁"
15912,1200518,"Passion fruit all the way. So drinkable, fresh and yummy. Just go for it!"
15913,1200518,"Fresh and crispy, green apple and tropical fruits"
15914,1200518,"Anselmo Mendes knows how to make Vinho Verde (maybe no one else knows, by the way 😬) ! This Alvarinho displays passion fruit, kiwi, lemon, herbal. It is very close to Sauvignon blanc, when made like this. Nice kick off !"
15915,1200518,"Luminous yellow. Great on the nose, Minty and tropical notes. Fully body with the sweetness well integrated with the acidity and minerality. It will only gain with age, but ready to drink now. Fresh and vibrant. One of the best Portuguese Alvarinhos. "
15916,1200518,Light tart easy drinking
15917,1200518,"Enjoying 🅾️ctopus (aka 🅿️olvo), gambas, ameijoas a bulhao pato and robalo by the 🅾️cean… this is about as close as I‘ll get to 🔠 Saturday this week 😂😂😂  100% Alvarinho with green apple, citrus fruit and tropical notes (mostly passion fruit, some unripe pineapple). Med+ acidity, med bodied. A nice and light lunch wine, (sea-) food friendly…  3,5 ⭐️ (location bonus included). "
15918,1200518,"Alvarinho from renowned winemaker, Anselmo Mendes.  Punchy tropical fruit & citrus notes as well as green and red apple. Lively acidity. Med body. Med finish.  We aren’t able to purchase much 🇵🇹wine in Calgary, but we do enjoy this one. Cheers!"
15919,1200518,"Very pleasant floral nose with some green notes. Moderate acidity, slight minerality which brings freshness. Not to long finish with some bitterness at the end."

15922,1834367,"I really like this, very balanced powerful wine, nice intense nose, black fruits, very spicy, leather. Very earthy, firm tannins in good balance with the alcohol sweetness and the acidity. Lovely"
15923,1834367,"Good catch! This one has a very aromatic and strong nose of dark chocolate, coffee and oak. Tongue feels pleasantly stiff, palate provides notes of cherry, black currant and honey. Dominant and with lots of alcohol, needs to be paired accordingly."
15924,1834367,"This top shit almost had a Bourgundy nose! It has oak,  bread yeast even a hint of  banana yet more the sweet after nose, if that exists at al;) great fruit and minerality. It’s dry and crisp at the same time. Elegant and alive and vibrant. Balanced and out there. Love the contrast of  honeydew melon and green pear, hints of honey blooming through. Acidity is medium high and takes you through a mouthfeel that keeps on going! Great wine to be short;)"

15932,1834367,A well-balanced Portuguese Red. My first time to try this region. Aroma of raspberries. 
15933,1834367,"This is a great tasting red, deserves a 4.3."
15934,1834367,Nice medium bodied wine. Really well balanced. Hints of cocos and berries.
15935,1099392,"N: raisins, floral notes P: medium bodied, sweet, medium- acidity, medium- tannins T: figs, cherries, toffee, raspberries  F: long, elegant "
15936,1099392,"Perfect harmony. The alcohol, the acidity, the sweetness, the tannin structure, the fruit. Lovely! And this wine still has decades to go until it reaches it's peak."
15937,1099392,"Raisins, raisins, raisins. If all raisins tasted like this... Wow, this is full of all the goodies you're after. Complexity mixed with simplicity that's is in fact just a fantastic Port."
15938,1099392,"Elegant murky nose of raisins and dried cranberries. Complex palate. Long finish. Tastes the same as Warre's Quinta da Cavadinha 2001, but much more elegant and complex. Six years can do a lot..."
15939,1099392,Stunning and will probably get better and better over the next decade or two. Lovely big smooth taste and gigantic hangover. This is what paracetamol was invented for - FACT!
15940,1099392,"We had 1995. Good exotic boquet with nice character. Coffee, dark chocolate, black currant, fully matured now, but can still be drunked the next 10 years or so, long aftertaste. A good wine, 91p"
15941,1099392,"Retasted and what a beautiful wine this is. Very rich with a profile of plums, sweet candied yet minty and fresh fruit, raisins. Warm and full of grip but totally balanced. Probably drinking at the peak of its lifetime. Probably."
15942,1099392,"These guys only do vintages, and they sure know their way around them.   👁 dark ruby 👃 marked balsamicness, backdrop of coffee and honey, then flowers such as violet 👄 juicy, jam-like, medium acidity at the end, beautiful finish. "
15943,1099392,"4.3. This is when owning a Coravin shines: fancying a glass of vintage port but by no means wanting to open a bottle.   Love you vintage Port. Deep dark color.  Raisin, tobacco and a hint of  licorice. Balancing acidity and whiff of tardiness. So nicely balanced. Very enjoyable now but still has legs to age quite a bit.  "
15944,1099392,"Symington tasting at the Graham’s Port Lodge 2/8. Outstanding ruby Port with notes of cigar box, spice, black cooked fruit, nuts and even mushroom. The traditional foot treading technique is still in use in this Quinta, one of Graham’s five."
15945,1099392,"Structured Symmington's premium tasting Oporto: Wickedly friendly. Pets you and then kicks you in the ass. Dark, maybe just starting to change colour. Nose: Dark berries with some spice. Initially smooth and friendly in the mouth and then boom powerful fruit. Still primary tastes of big fruit. Long finnish. Of the ""younger"" ones my favourite."
15946,1099392,96pts me  The single vineyard vesuvio only made in years when a general vintage could not be declared is quite a good bargain at lesser years   A port driven by minerality with roasted liquorice cinnamon mulberry jam and a hint of mint over rich dark cherries and firewood but smooth yet peppery  Ripe massive yet soft and wonderful mouthfeel with good intensity in check and balanced by it's acid and long finish   Quite beyond belief. Wonderful
15947,1099392,"Hannukah is over (just...) and i have a spare candle. Never mind that the black glass on the Vesuvio is virtually rated 'Dragon Glass' and even my black diamond head torch can't start to penetrate it... i still keep to the tradition of a candle. This is just divine. Vesuvio needs no introduction. This 1995 is only 6 years after the Symmingtons had bought this gorgeous piece of paradise.The'old style' is still here, lots of power but also flowers  (violets), low/med tannins. Mesmerizing stuff.Happy Xmas ! :)"

15950,2422330,"Excellent Douro, love it!  Very good value. Bold, complex, dark, with pleasant tannins and long tasting curve. Versatile with various dishes, but also spectacular solo!👏🏻👌🏻 Needs some decanting. Blackcurrant, blackberry, cherry, oak, leather, chocolate, tobacco, and some earthy and vanilla tones to complete this masterpiece. 4,3, with the price in mind. Cheers!"
15951,2422330,For the price is amazing wine delightful and very tasty. 91 92

On the first sip I was not impressed and couldn't identify the flavors either. But after the first glass I liked this much more. Still a strange wine for my opinion, not a dime s dozen white.

16104,2014583,"Peachy, sweet but good"
16105,2014583,"We sipped this with a plate of cheese and fruit.  Probably a 3.8 in my field notes.  Inscrutable subdued nose; something like a damp hayfield with a dose of dry sherry thrown in. The taste is a bit subdued also, but pleasantly so.  Sour cherry, minerals, orange zest, strawberry, and prunes are all in the mix.  Bone dry and peppery with subtle leathery tanins. Well crafted wine."
16106,2014583,"Purple red in the glass. Not a huge nose initially but opens up a little to some black fruit. Blackcurrant prominent on the palette. The finish is full of spice, very dry with strong tannins. Went well with my steak. Enjoyed at Steak House, Alvor, Portugal"
16107,2014583,"Oak and wild berries nose with a nice dark almost brownish red color and great tearing. On the palate there are hints of sour cherry, dark chocolate, spices and a bit if caramel. Pairs with game, cheese, saucy dishes and red meats. "

On palate, med + acid, med + body, med finish. Was a richer,oilier mouthfeel and bone dry.  Oak and fruit  presence a component that can't be ignored when pairing with food.  Went great with my spicy  potato dosa with coconut chutney.   Really fresh, fun, fat, and fruity.  "

16115,5127002,"Tart, crisp, and complex at the front. Buttery pear finish. Very complex for a white. "
16116,5127002,Costco $20.  100% buy more to always have at home 
16117,5127002,"Straw yellow colour. Tropical fruits, minerals and oak on the nose. Taste of tropical fruits, minerals, butter and sweet spices. Long and oaky finish with nutmeg and toast. High acidity. Goes well with fish and poultry with creamy sauces."
16118,5127002,A little too robust for me. This was actually a red wine from Portugal 
16119,5127002,Dry but full of stone fruit flavor 
16120,5127002,"Very nice Portuguese blend from Douro,  a delicate, silver-gold color with warm straw reflexes.  Nose: ripe yellow fruit, floral aromas, fresh herbs, vanilla and oak.  In the mouth: ripe fruit, mango, melon, apricot, exotic fruit, some citrus and yellow apple, spice, vanilla whit oak accents, dry hay.  Wine well balanced, smooth and fresh, with a full body and a nice texture.  Finish: creamy-buttery."
16121,5127002,"Really good PQR. White Douro showing a lot of oak, peach, touch of citrus and some buttery notes. I recommend not to drink very cold...12*C is enough. 3.4"
16122,5127002,Medium bodied good balance. Slightly sour. Great wine.
16123,5127002,"From the «Fin vin & brennevin» tasting at Gamle Logen in Oslo.  3,5+⭐️ Sav. Blanc meets Chardonnay kinda style. Citrus. "

16128,1223379,"Black fruits, slight volatile acidity reminding of balsamic vinegar, really elegant aroma. Strong tannins, smooth texture, long finish. "
16129,1223379,"Drinking this before Italy vs Spain semi final match , go Italy ! Plums , tobacco , dark chocolate , velvet tannins . The one you want to order when having steak , or spice & rich flavored food . My husband also enjoyed it . It tasted even better on the second day , I should buy more "
16130,1223379,Absolutely breath taking stuff here.   What a beautiful combination of aging rich fruit and stunningly integrated oak.   Maturing fruit and a fresh herbaciousness is such a wonderful combination.   Let it breath for no more than 30 minutes and watch as the wine evolves.   Beautiful.   https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKE9aiRgb5V/?igshid=1ph4snkbwnhkl
16131,1223379,Paired well with a 36-hour confit suckling pig. Me likey mucho. 
16132,1223379,"Deep ruby in the glass, plum, black cherry, balsamic vinegar (volatile acidity), earthy. Dry, high acidity, high grippy tannins, medium + acidity, full body, flavours of black cherry and plum, long finish. Very good"
16133,1223379,"Good flavors and aromas of fruit (black fruit and red fruit). Oak, exotic yeast, coconut nut, notes, that gives a sweet sensation, but cuts by a pleasant slight bitter (black chocolate). Ruby / garnet color. Full-bodied, medium dry. Overall, on the olfactory / gustatory level its a pleasant wine. However it's not my style of wines.  I found the notes very alien.  The vineyard and terroir seemed to me to be overshadowed by the winery... I prefer a more natural style... Contains sulphites. 14. Alcohol."
16134,1223379,"This a very good and refreshing wine, but I was expecting more from this fantastic winery and by the expensive price!"
16135,1223379, oak chocolate leather balsamic dark fruit oak chocolate vanilla
16136,1223379,Full bodie with light fruit notes of raspberry and red currant. Leads into an amazing cigar box smokiness and forest floor vegetation note. Great wine to pair with venison or a fish stew.
16137,1223379,"Bull bodied, rich and lovely"
16138,1223379,"Full body, with balanced tannins, medium dry. Vanilla, oak, leather, plum, raspberry,. Lovely with bratwurst and red meat. Great red!"
16139,1223379,"Sweet nose, jam, dark fruit. I totally also smell the balsamic vinegar in the finish, but it disperses fast. Mouth first sensation - I like it a Lot! A lot of pepper, earthy, dark fruit. It is a very pronounced, bold taste. "
16140,1223379,"Dark ruby, lovely bouquet of ripe black fruits, pepper, cocoa. Complex and well balanced, a delicious wine on the palate with super long finish of plum, prune and toffee. "
16141,1223379,"Deep purple red color with violet rim reflections. Notes of ripe black fruit, blackberry, black currant, black cherry, dried herbs, coffee, toffee, tobacco leaves, cigar box and licorice. Well structured with firm tannins, full bodied, balanced, good acidity and long seductive finish. Great wine !!!"
16142,7215499,"Bought by curiosity as it isn’t common to have a 100% petit Verdot. Deep deep garnet in colour, aromas of red cherry, Chocolate, Licorice and some subtle Minerality and stone.   On the mouth it’s fresh, fruit dominante at first, the deep velvet feeling supported by fresh and short tannins. The acidity keeps the whole wine in balance. The more I sip the more i’m impressed. "
16143,7215499,Encorpado seco e com final
16144,4460318,"Well made Douro wine from Dick Niepoort. Dry, medium body and lighter than most Douro, “only” 13o alcohol. Still early days for this 2016 crop, but almost 4.5 for me. Notes of oak, cocoa, nutmeg, cherry and pomegranate. Paired with roasted pork with chestnut and apple purée."
16145,4460318,"Great place for a matured steak, I always let them surprise me with a nice Douro 🥩🍷"

16150,4460318,"🇵🇹 tinto do Douro, bebido em casa do meu pai. Sem menção das uvas usadas. Estágio de 12 meses em barrica. Suave, fácil de beber. Agradável.  🇬🇧 Red wine from Douro. Drank it at my father's house. No metion of the grapes used. 12 months in barrela. Smooth and easy to drink. Nice wine."
16151,4460318,A bit thin and not as complex as I expect with Portuguese reds.
16152,4460318,Full body very decent douro
16153,4460318,Huge fresh berries. Slightly floral. Moderate tannin. Tart acid. Very nice wine. 
16154,4460318,"4,25. 2015 is the first vintage made by Dirk Niepoort at Maria Izabel. Judging by the quality, I assume it won’t be the last, and the association of the Niepoorts and Georges Dos Santos (Antic Wine, Lyon) to run this Quinta is already very exciting.  Served blind, everybody guessed a ripe and subtle Pinot Noir supported by gorgeous cherry and raspberry aromas, warming spices (white pepper), floral and discreet oak.  Sorry guys... welcome to the Douro !!  Tasted with Jack Madrid and Chantal Montcher. "
16155,4460318,Pleasant to drink alone or with pork or other lean protein. A little one dimensional - palate is a little flat. 
16156,4460318,Juicy tobacco on the nose makes the mouth water. Tannins dance around the mouth but are balanced out by dark cherry in this well-structured wine.
16157,4460318,"Dark violet color, scent of red berries and hint of leather, present acidity, fresh blackberry and black cherry, undertone of tobacco, body and finish on the lighter side, young but fine grained tannin."
16158,4460318,Bought this at a wine shop in Lisbon on the recommendation of the sales person.  It was a great surprise. Light but round and complex. Great to just drink it with friends but also to have it alongside food. 
16159,5666689,"Splendid red from Alentejo! A rich and elegant Pinot Noir, aged 10m in French oak barrels (500L). Concentrated and complex, with great acidity and length. Ruby color, ripe red fruits/berries aromas/flavors, specially cherry and raspberry, floral, with notes of cassis, eucalyptus, spices and an hint of salinity. Medium to full body, velvety tannins and a juicy lingering finish. Excellent Pinot Noir, with great value and already drinking very well, but still growing!"
16160,5666689,"Bright garnet red color.  Elegant aroma with notes of cherry and eucalyptus.  In the mouth it remains elegant, confirming the notes of cherry in a smooth combination with ripe tannins and balanced acidity.  Nice finish, salty and prolonged.  A great wine."
16161,5666689,"#600. Excellent come back! I'm still sure this is one of most successful PNs from PT tasted so far. Layers&layers on the nose and palate-original notes from October are fully viable. After half a year it shows a light evolution where vegetal notes transform to herbal spices with cardamom&white pepper leading the endless orchestration. Balance&structure are simply great on the palate. Salty, mineral, v.long aftertaste. 4,3 again. VFM! Lay down, take a glass, pair it with Peter Green's 'Albatross' or... love."
16162,5666689,"Fresh and chilled strawberry and raspberry fruits. Minerality. Slim and fruity Pinot Noir with velvety mouthfeel, good acid. Slight licorice. Cranberries and pomegranate. Sour-cherry freshness."

On the nose eucalyptus, wild strawberries, hint of licorice. High acidity and too much perceptible alcohol on the palate. I felt it was still unbalanced. My guess was Croatia, 2017. But Gintaras was faithful to himself - Portugal😁 3.7🍷"

A weighy wine where lots of melon and honey come through on the nose and palate. Deep in flavour but with mass appeal as the acidity and minerality of it leaves a long lasting finish.   "
16193,7441897,"Not a very pleasant nose of resins and wax. But the wine itself is amazing. Straw color. Honey, melon and apricot. Dry metallic finish. I could drink this one forever."

16216,1825692,Lemony with hints of melon. Balanced acidity and a nice body. Delicious wine for lunch with fish.  Saúde!
16217,1825692,"Quite decent for the price. Faint nose of canned peach. On the palate, grapefruit, lemon, citrus rind, and peach. Not a lot of presence, and has blind spots on the tongue (especially towards the front). Slightly metallic on the finish. The overall effect is like a muted canned fruit salad to my palate. Unlikely to knock anyone’s socks off, but certainly a better-than-average option for the <$20 range."
16218,1825692,"Flinty to start, them opens up, excellent "
16219,4424318,Ridiculous.  Wine is aged 30m underwater in a “lake cave”.  Smooth from start to finish.  Let it open for 5+ minutes and you have a totally different wine.

16222,4424318,"Thanks Rodrigo👍🍷😃 Amazing Portuguese blend, nice mature(30meters under water)wine, deep purple color with cherry glow. Nos: soft, aromatic, red berries, cocoa, round oak barrels, violets. In the mouth: juicy red fruit, berries, cherries, plums, soft dried herbs, spices, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, a bit of forest rustic notes with mild tobacco aftertaste. Wine medium heavy, full body, balanced, smooth, velvety with great ripe tannins and dense fruity acidity. Finish elegant, sophisticated and extremely long."
16223,4424318,"Medium bold red with medium tannin. The nose was primarily leather, cedar and blackcurrant. Wood focused. Complimented with some cherry on the palate. "
16224,4424318,"4 ⭐️ it gets way better with some waiting time, something like 30 min is sufficient. Better enjoyed at 18dgC Dry with medium body, round in mouth.  oak cherry leather blackberry violet"
16225,4424318,We loved tasting with the land based wine  of same vintage - really cool different tastes- this has a vanilla prominence and is amazing.
16226,4424318,"""The wine from water"" or Vinho da Agua. The wine, which has already matured, eight months in barrels, was placed 30 meters below the surface of water for 8 month for the second maturation. Very elegant. 5 🌟 nose. 3 🌟 mouth, half 🌟 for innovation."
16227,4424318,Famous wine from Ervideiras due to its storage under water. What’s the difference? No idea! Worth the marketing though 
16228,4424318,"Very good wine, and with a story behind: in the production process, once in bottle, it is aged 30m underwater in a Portuguese river, the absence of light and the pressure or water being 2 key factors. I suggest you try it and compare with the red wine from same producer that instead follows normal ageing (on ground) to appreciate the difference in taste!"
16229,4424318,Either most reviews here are wrong or someone didn't take care of this bottle properly before it got to me. And I think it's the latter. Shame! 
16230,4424318,"Good flavors and aromas of fruit ( black fruit and red fruit) and lots of oak and exotic yeast notes. Ruby / garnet color. Full-bodied, medium dry. In terms of smell and taste, it is a pleasant red from Alentejo region, for those who enjoy oaked and yeasty wine  (which is not my case).         Contains sulphites. 13.º alcohol. "
16231,4424318,Silky smooth very soft tannins and abs no sentiment. Is this a result of maturing at 4 bar pressure 30m below a lake surface. Sublime.👍
16232,4424318,"Delicious, slightly dry with the most amazing floral bouquet. "
16233,4424318,Very fruity in the end...
16234,1183111,"A star that is a bit on the expensive side but true winemaking skills exhibited. The reserva means oak, Dark fruit and leather but also a first  easy kiss on tongue. "

16252,2630148,"A very enjoyable Alentejo. Deep dark color, full bodied, nicely depth. Definitely opened it a bit prematurely, think I need to give it some more time. Notes of black fruit and oak, quite a lot of tannin. A bit tight still, so let’s see how this develops "
16253,2630148,"Good, but not exceptional. Not a 4.2 for me. Somewhere between 3.5 and 4.0had this in restaurant Veneza in Paderne, Algarve"

16261,2630148,"Delicious, prunes, blueberry, oak, vanilla and sweet spices. Tannins are marked but really well integrated and match nicely the ling finish"
16262,2630148,"Smooth, dry, fruit forward"
16263,2630148,Complex stuff with chocolate coffee oak black fruit plum and balsamic aromas on the nose. Put it in the cellar and don’t look at it for the next 15 years. This one is going to be a gem!
16264,78243,"Deep purple - a bit sour in the nose - nice balance - medium weight, with more finish than I remember from last year, and more delicious. 4 hour decant. Syrah, Merlot, and Tinta Roriz."
16265,78243,"Nice blend of Syrah, Tinto Roriz and Merlot this red is already on a ideal point of evolution. Showing a bouquet of dark cherry fruit, dusty plum, sweet spice ( cinnamon,aniseed and gingerbread ) On the palate smooth, with fine tannins and pleasant and long lasting length ."
16266,78243,"Very nice, bold red with prominent aromas of leather, tobacco and spices. A bit of a bitter back taste and good acidity make an overall balanced and very good wine. "

16273,1146705,"PnP and it already tastes so good. Silky red-purplish wine with loads of licorice, red/black fruits, balsamic, and spicy back end. Absolute elegantlicious! And pretty solid mid palate. This flagship wine came from the best selection of pre-phylloxera Alicante Bouschet of some 80 year old, which were then trodden in marble presses and vinified at controlled temperatures. Spent 42 months before release. ABV 13.5%."

16277,1146705,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. Full-bodied, medium-dry. Still young. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Alentejo region. Contains sulfites. 13,5.° alcohol.   "
16278,1146705,"Fantastic wine served in a Portuguese tapasbar. Price below EUR 20,-. Fruity, elegant and body. Supurb. "
16279,1146705,"Fruity, cherry, woak"
16280,1146705,"Nicely balanced. The right amount of wood for me. Some complexity, depth, and dark fruits. Maybe some leather at the end. A great way to spend an evening. "
16281,1146705,"Does anyone knows how Alicante Bouschet is known in Spain? And in France?  A:mid ruby N:amazing complexity with aromas of black fruit (blackberry, plum), black pepper, lactic touch, mint, bit of undergrowth, just crazy to find so many different things P:dry, high acidity, ripe mid tannin, mid+alcohol with mid+body sensation and almost long finish with nice fruity aromas and roasted coffee C:very good but still young wine,great expression in nose but didn’t deliver as much in mouth!"

16287,1522830,Great red sparkling 
16288,1522830,"Interesting Baga wine, complex and spicy flavour but softer than expected on tannins. Plum, berries and vanilla on the end."
16289,1522830,One of the best… @[1|32004841|Tiago Luiz]
16290,1522830,"4,2 - amazing QPR and example of the Baga grape. Extreme softness of fruit however with lots of depth and complexity. Amazing wine"
16291,1522830,I liked the wine this time also. Medium tannins and acid. There is oak in this one and both red and dark fruits. A lot of plum
16292,1522830,"A perfect match with lamb racks! Very balanced by the ripe blackberry fruits, weight and richness. Good density and mature fruit. oak plum."
16293,1522830,"Sophisticated licquorice, milk chocolate and dark flower perfume. Baga is a complicated variety, but they really mastered it here."
16294,1522830,"Really nice! Eye: bold ruby Nose: red berries, tomato, rooibos, lacquer Acidity: high Taste: chocolate, cherry jam. Light tannins and finish"
16295,1522830,My flavour Portugese wine of the day. Nice deep cherry red with med/full body. Fruity and woody nose.  Decent structure and good balance. 
16296,1522830,Dense ruby color with violaceous tons. Incredible buquê with red flowers at nose. Smooth and soft at mouth with a persistent aftertaste. 
16297,1522830,"Plums, dark cherries, tobacco and vanilla. Round velvety body. Strawberries and wood in a fresh finish. Needs some time to open up. Initially may look a bit obscured by the oaky notes. "
16298,1522830,"Great Portuguese wine.  Nose: dark berries, a bit of leather and chocolate.  Mouth:very soft wine with great balance, dark berries and cherry.  Good stuff: 3.8"
16299,1522830,"Really good - tannic at first, after some time transforms into dark and silky black fruit with a pinch of leather flavor. Has some complexity in it. Good pair to a steak"
16300,1522830,"3,8⭐Nice Bairrada red showing off the 🍇Baga. 👀Ruby with garnet rims. Quick tears. 👃Pleasant and different (for those not familiar with Baga) with cedar, pine, oak and cherry. 👅Balanced and bold with punchy tannins. Dry and nice acidity. 🗒️Pretty good to pair with strong cheeses. Think it will age well. One to retry in a few years for sure."
16301,1522830,"Ruby red colour with many fast legs.  Bold bouquet fruity with black fruit, plum and vanilla.  Bold, elegant, complex and dry on the palate. Red fruit, plum, oak   Grape Bairrada 13% alcohol Portuguese bold wine good with red meat, lamb and matured cheese.  From Adega de Cantanhede, 2 thirds up to Porto from Lissabon."
16302,4262275,"This wine is hay coloured, an intense yellow longing to be poured. Presents us with a buttery nose, with hints of honey. When tasted, I sensed mature cereal crops on a rainy summer day but also some acidity, like very mature lemons. Probably the best Chardonnay in Portugal."
16303,4262275,"Unexpected find in Lisbon. Tropical mango, pear, and stone fruit nose. Medium high acidity. Medium full body. Lightly saline, dehydrated apple, dried white peach, and dried pear. Light caramel and Citrus panna cotta finish 4.3⭐️ balanced and full of flavor. "
16304,4262275,"Golden in color. Tropical fruit nose. Pineapple, guava, lemon and lime. Medium plus acidity, oak, vanilla and tropical fruit on the body. Great find!"
16305,4262275,"Light brown color and  crystalline appearance.  Intense ripe wellow fruits aroma, with some floral  notes.  In the mouth shows great impact, voluminous and enveloping.  At the end they appear the nuts  and wood notes  from the barrel stage. The salty notes are very present and make this wine a great pleasure and a great discovery. I liked very much this wine."
16306,4262275,"Green apple, citrus and smells of valilla"
16307,4262275,"A very pale Chardonnay with a real hit of fresh green apples on the nose but with the true oaky hint you expect of a French barrel aged Chardonnay.  On the taste it is very bitter with the green apple really coming through.  While you do get the butter taste and feel you expect, it is far more subtle and actually closer to a Stainless aged wine than oak.  This is a Chardonnay you could drink without food but it really did work with our food pairing.  Chardonnay still not my favourite wine but this is close"
16308,4262275,"Nose saline and minerals, mouthfeel clearly Chardonnay. Good weight/concentration. Light oak. Great pairing wine. "
16309,4262275,Very Chardonnay and yet with different tones
16310,4262275,"Excellent Portuguese Chardonnay  from Lisbon, a pale straw-yellow color, with platinum reflexes. Beautiful wine with aroma of ripe exotic fruits, pineapples, melon,lemon, red grapefruits, some spices, yellow apples, and baked apples, vanilla,  Wine soft, creamy, with nice structure, velvety texture, and perfect balanced. Finish elegant, smooth and memorable."
16311,4262275,"Hand-picked grapes and fermentation in French oak.  Intensity on the nose is pronounced. Aromas of tropical fruits, peach, vanilla and butter. Creamy texture. Full body and long finish.   Very good wine. Would be amazing when pairing with fatty fish. "
16312,4262275,"Very nice. A bit of punch with tasty citrus and apple notes, the fuller mouth feel of Chardonnay, and a clean finish. "
16313,4262275,Intersting Malvasia. Oak in colour and taste. “Madeira” like. 
16314,4262275,Enjoying our 6th wedding anniversary in Porches at olea de porches 
16315,4262275,Very good. Some fried apple. Very little mineral. Some oak.
16316,4262275,"Lovely ripe pears and apples, a hint of salinity, thinner on the palate. Good finish"
16317,1150822,"Very balanced and delicate. Showing well with medium plus structure, rich but not overwhelmingly fruity, with a lighter spicier and drier style than other 2013 VPs I've tasted. Approachable and will possibly be good for 15-20 years. More than that will be risky"
16318,1150822,"Nutty and really raisiny, but shows the very hot nature of the vintage. Full-bodied and very sweet, with loads of fruit and a long finish.  "
16319,1150822,Lacks a bit depth or complexity but it will provide immediate plaisure by its juicy and candied fruit with hints of chocolate. 
16320,1150822,Very young. Sharp
16321,1150822,"Very nice. Impressive aroma, some leather. Lots of fruits and flowers. Very impressive."
16322,1150822,Intense nose of red and dark berries. Nicely  tannic and very drinkable but too obviously sweet. Lacking a bit in depth and structure. 89-91p.
16323,1150822,"Powerfull aroma of dried red berries and fruits.  Full taste of same, with a long pleasant aftertaste. Recomended."
16324,1150822,Dark fruit. Tannic. Not too sweet. 
16325,1150822,Eye: Dark ruby. Nose: Sweet port tones. Mouth: Some sweetness. I was not impressed. Not much to offer.
16326,1150822,Tooooo young. A crime to drink now. 
16327,1150822,Fruity yet surprisingly dry. A lovely port to have with chocolate. 
16328,1150822,"very good, smooth, bold, a little too sweet"
16329,1150822,"Nogenlunde, men dog for let."
16330,1150822,"Tasty and developed Porto. A bit more acidity and it would be really great.  Smokey cherry nose with baking spices, some clove and nutmeg. Medium acidity, thick and creamy, medium sweet, jammy red fruit, cake, marzipan, roasted hazelnuts, mint chocolates, mild but drying tanines, some alcohol burn.   Fantastic with the classic pairing with blue and Limburger (Hèrve) cheese, grapes and almonds."
16331,1150822,"A powerful vintage Port. Black fruit on the nose, dried fruit, almonds and chocolate. Tobacco, coffee and leather on the palate, hints of cheese on the finish. Overall complex, lasting and enjoyable."
16332,2044638,Fantastic length and complexity. Original and elegant combined with strength. Super wine. 
16333,2044638,"My experience of this wine expressed by Robert Parker scale: 50 pt in start color and appearance 5/5 pt aroma and bouquet 11/15 pt flavor and finish 15/20 pt subjective factor and experience 7/10 pt. Sum is 88 pt and it corelates with Vivino 3,7⭐️"
16334,2044638,Cherry and leather in a good way ..smooth and mouth filling
16335,2044638,Very full bodied portuguese red.  Delicious.
16336,2044638,"Still young wine, with great potencial to evolve. violet color. Dark berries aroma. In the mouth is fresh, tasty and full bodied. Long finish"
16337,2044638,"4,0⭐My 2nd Alfrocheiro monovarietal. 👀Dark ruby with slightly brown rims. Abundant and slow tears. 👃Shy at first. Oak, vanilla and a bit of black fruits. 👅Medium-full body but quite fresh. Dry and with medium-high acidity. A bit of astringency from those tannins, let it breath a while. Medium finish. 🗒️I'm starting to really enjoy these monovarietals, although this one didn't reach M.O.B.'s one level because it showed a bit more unbalanced. I think this would match very nicely with some octopus dish."
16338,2044638,"Delicious varietal from a prolific blended grape. Wine is probably peeking down by its raisin and Danes jelly. Also by it’s orangeish halo. Tannins are smooth and acohol balanced. Fruit that seems sweet, but it isn’t. Great buy."
16339,2044638,"Wines from Portugal, June 10. Great Wines of Dão tasting, #4 of 6. Winemaker is Manual Vieira, the Pope of Dão. Medium ruby color, balsamic and red fruits aromas, fresh acidity, firm tannins and long finish. Aged partially for 18 months in used French oak. 14% abv. Rate 3.9"
16340,2044638,"Taut, muscular dark fruit, with great structure and considerable refinement. The ripeness comes through on the sweetish finish, but there's a wonderful dark, brooding nature to the wine.  From an excellent, medium sized producer, in what is possibly Portugal's highest quality red wine region, Dão.  Relatively rare to find Alfrocheiro made as a varietal wine.  This could age for 5-10 years, although no need to wait. A lot of pleasure to be had right now!"
16341,2044638,"Daō (central Portugal) - 18 months of french barrique is quite noticeable ripe tannins -  vanilla licorice some rough edges. Some medical tones. Drying tannins which I find strange the age. @Awwijn, Amsterdam "
16342,2044638,"The Alfrocheiro grape variety originates wines that are distinguished by the freshness and tannic structure. This wine is packed with ripe blackberries and black plum. There's a strong sizzle of acidity on the tip of the sip and together with medium tannins structure doesn’t celebrate a fine balance. Its body is full, and the finish ends short. Not my favorite Dao"
16343,2044638,"Another Portuguese powerhouse. Made of the niche Alfrocheiro grape. This dark colored red benefits from a little air time, releasing the rich deep flavours and heavy scent. It has an earthy bitterness that's very appealing and dried ripe plum or tutti frutti. Enjoy!"
16344,2044638,"Well, this was a strange one at the Portugal tasting. My first association was a Dogliani; purplish colored, unfiltered. Spices and fresh near ripe red fruit, vivacious and a little tangy. Med+ acidity and med tannic. Lacking balance due to acidity. It is either a love or hate style or this was an off bottle, I recon. Not really my thing. 13 pts."
16345,2044638,"Single variety Alfrocheiro, aged for 18 months in the oak. Nice fruity expression with dark fruit, fresh coffee notes and baked spice. Bold and rounded. "
16346,2044638,"Not really my cup of tea (or rather glass of wine...). It is not bad, but I think it is not properly balanced, does not have real character and is too “warm” and not complex enough.   On the nose: vanilla, oak, some faint hints of dark fruit but other than that I could not get much on the nose... on the palate: incoherent, unbalanced and simply too warm for my liking.   Cheers!"
16347,1180029,"3.9 Husband wife team. Located between Vidigueira and Cuba, lower alentejo.Blend with moreta, tinta grossa, trincadera and aragonez in tinaja. Red cherries , blackberries, oak. Very young fruity , evolved nicely and more interesting on D2"
16348,1180029,"90 pts; med-ruby with a pink rim; raspberry, lilacs, and a hint of tomato leaf on the nose; flavours are consistent with red popsicles tossed in; there is a bit of a chemical note that I don’t like but it will soften over time; young tannins with good structure that will continue to develop. Solid finish. Lay down for 3 to 5 years and you’ll  be rewarded. 12 euro at the winery. Recommended."
16349,1180029,"Taste of skin and blueberries, full bodied, still too much tannins, some years later I think it is much better "
16350,1180029,"A good entry-level red - rich, balanced, structured, showing the promise better expressed in Rocim's reserva, SVs, etc"
16351,1180029,Really unusual and delicious. Vanilla and cinnamon and red fruit. Quite smooth.
16352,1180029,Lovely sense dark fruit and a bot of oak PV €9.45
16353,1180029,Nice medium body Portuguese red. 
16354,1180029,Juicy Portuguese boi 
16355,1180029,"Tastes of vanilla and chocolate, very smooth tasting wine. "
16356,1180029,"Nice balance to this, with strong blueberry and damson notes held together by the tannins. An enjoyable close to the evening. "
16357,1180029,Went beautifully with roasted goat dish at Porto restaurant. Tasted black berries and complemented entire meal. Recommended by waiter. 
16358,1180029,"Lovely notes of plum, oak and vanilla. I was surprised by how enjoyable this Red was. We paid it with NY strip steak, mushroom and garlic risotto, and butter bib lettuce. "
16359,1180029,Will benefit from a bit of air. Medium all around but fairly longer finish. Plum is most dominant but more to discover
16360,1180029,"Dark garnet color, medium body. Violets, pencil shavings, spice and green pepper on the nose. Plum, red stone fruit, vanilla, leather, and cinnamon on the palate. Paired wonderfully with squid marinara, focaccia, and grilled asparagus"
16361,1180029,Decent. Notes of vanilla and cinnamon on the palate. 
16362,6760878,"Fully mineral, almost metalic, as is usual in Arinto and especially in Bucelas, its home ground. Very citric, but oak provided a balanced oiliness."
16363,6760878,"Got as something to try with an Arinto masterclass (instagram @viannawine 19 Nov 2020) and it was a worthy choice: vegetal suggestion on the nose, shade of honey and nut (3yo), carrying a buttery sense of sweet wood into the palate, with a nice length of clean, pleasing citrus to finish - subtle, balanced, 'complete'; a very well made and enjoyable white, albeit perhaps for the purist not a 'straight' Arinto rendition. (12.5% abv)."
16364,6760878,"Lemon, lemon, lemon, with some minerals great acidity, medium persistence.  Very good wine, great personality and a fantastic example of the Arinto grape. Highly recomended."
16365,6760878,"Bright medium intense golden yellow with very elegant aromas of green apple, grapefruit, lemon zest and hazelnut. Balanced with good structure, smooth texture, high acidity and lovely finish"
16366,6760878,Very interesting. Mineral and austere but highly structured. 
16367,6760878,"Best expression of oaked Arinto I’ve tried. Gorgeous mix of those citric, herbal hints typical of the grape and really big, buttery notes from the oak aging. On the palate, beautiful minerality with great acidity and this enveloping, creamy, vanilla and buttery profile while keeping a gorgeous elegance. Wowed by this Arinto - 4.3⭐️ with room to grow"
16368,6760878,"This Arinto from Jorge Rosas Santos is a surprise to me. The creamy texture with a very welcoming, long-lasting and elegant acidity are the king here. It's very delicious and seems never get bored with. The salty aftertaste with some subtle bitterness really give the wine true character and very enjoyable. Very impressive. The only thing that I expected more from this wine is the aromatic profile, it's relatively reduced and shy of expression, but it doesn't affect the drinking experiences. Lovely."
16369,6760878,Such a good surprise!
16370,6760878,"Typical arinto acidity, well balanced and tasty "
16371,6760878,"Acidez média-alta, nota a pão torrado, toranja, fruto seco e citrino maduro. Intense golden yellow , notes of toasted bread, ripe citrus and hazelnuts. "
16372,6760878,A little acid
16373,4490927,"Delicate, light citrus, mineral notes. Very pleasant, "
16374,4490927,"Minerally, lemony with just the right amount of acidity to enjoy cheese. A good qualitu wine."
16375,4490927,"Some interesting notes, of the dry, dried fruits kind, and atypical of Portuguese wine, but perhaps missing just something to make it great"
16376,4490927,"Great legs, clean, crisp & refreshing, drink appropriately chilled. Not a complex wine or finish. Best for for enjoying beach or poolside on a hot summer’s day. "
16377,4490927,"Black fruit, dry, dark cherry"
16378,4490927,Full body and light colour. Notes of strawberry and earthy. Paired with home made tagliatelle and meatballs.
16379,4490927,This is a surprisingly clean and complex natural wine without anything else clinging to it - no notes other than smooth fruitiness (and I’m usually an oak person!) I feel you could happily enjoy this with most meals and on a special occasion too. 
16380,4490927,"Ripe plum, cherry and dark berries. Finishing tones of leather and tobacco. "
16381,4490927,Dry full bodied hints of berry and earth 
16382,4490927,Full bodied. Black fruit but to me seemed a little light for a 2016 should have had a longer finish
16383,4490927,Crispy and string 
16384,4490927,Fantastic balance between acidity and freshness this is what this grape is all about the heart of interior of Portugal one of the best white grapes in Portugal. 
16385,4490927,"Clear color and citrine. A little expressive aroma of green apple. In the mouth shows fresh fruit, and minerality with a refreshing citrus acidity. Long and very nice finish"
16386,4490927,"4⭐️ for this Portuguese Dão 🇵🇹 red wine. 👁 Dull visual with a dark ruby color. 👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry with some fruits and a second sniff focused on vanilla, chocolate, tobacco and plum. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of plum and tobacco; full body. Good persistence in the mouth with medium finish. Elegant red wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🍷"
16387,4490927,Light and beautifully balanced  
16388,1361674,"With personality and presence. It’s not a traditional Dão wine but for sure a good red wine, maybe a little too expensive."
16389,1361674,Nice intense nose and finish. Black fruits 
16390,1361674,"Really nice surprise !  Touriga Nacional 40%, Tinta Roriz 30%, Jaen 30% blend, with 18 months of wood.  This 2012 is dark ruby, complex nose with aromas of green leaves, berries, plums, menthol. Great acidity, well integrated wood, nice, long and agreable finale ! 👌 Recommend ! Different Dao Wine and a surprise, a very nice one ! "
16391,1361674,"2010 great year better wine. Smooth, medium dry, plum aroma"
16392,1361674,"Dark fruits, black currant, toast and violet, some smokiness. Good intensity and acidity, a touch of liquor ish. A nice wine"
16393,1361674,"Very pleasant, smooth, dark cherries, oaky and barrel notes. Strong tannins, long finish."
16394,1361674,"Encorpado, intenso e graduado!"
16395,1361674,Encorpado e frutado
16396,1258875,"Toasts, roasted. Prunes, very matured raspberries and blackberries, dry and peppery. With food ok, if sauté look for another one..."
16397,1258875,"Ruby color. Aromatic, ripe fruit. bodied, tannins still present and still s little bit harsh. Long and persistent final. A different wine, not easy to drink but not bad. I would like to taste in a 3/4 years from now but... It's the only bottle! "
16398,1258875,"Average value for money, too bitter, no specific taste"
16399,1258875,Do not buy at full price. At 66% discount can double as a decent table wine. But Reserva? Come on. Watery and emptyish.
16400,1258875," Dry fruity wine deep Colour and a fine wine for daily use, and priced right "
16401,1258875,"Medium soft, but very good"
16402,1258875,"Very dry, acidic taste. Breathing doesn't make it smoother and it is hard to notice the oily taste of an Alentejano."
16403,1258875,"A delicious, lively, well-made wine. Medium bodied, fruity and well balanced. No pretensions of being a classic wine, just very nice to drink! Excellent with pasta, or more or less anything else."
16404,1258875,Nothing special. An average wine for average moments.
16405,1258875,Top wine. I do not understand why is classified so low. 
16406,1191944,"Intense grenade color.  Intense aroma of wild black fruit, violets and some orange peel.  In the mouth is very expressive, complex, with generous and elegant tannins.  Very gastronomic.  Long and tasty finish.  Excellent and powerful wine"
16407,1191944,"Spicy notes, cardamom, cumin, pepper; dried violet, cherry, blueberry, chocolate; bold wine with refreshing acidity."
16408,1191944,"Amazing Dao! Great producer! Clean, soft, balanced "
16409,1191944,"Red deep cherry color. Balanced acidity soft fresh tannins, lasting aftertaste. Powerful and multi layers. Tastes and aroma of fresh red fruits, minerals, herbs. 91"
16410,1191944,Amazing Daõ! Slightly reductive in a very oddly enticing way-unfiltered Pinot comes to mind. Extremely balanced on the 👃  Black cherries touched with figs without being overpowering. Superfine tannins - it's like rating an intelligent Bourgogne producer. Portuguese wine is at its worst acceptable and at its best completely outstanding. This falls closer to latter. 
16411,1191944,Good but hoping it will improve over age. 
16412,1191944,"Aired for 30 minutes. Rich noise, strong palate - solid overall"
16413,1191944,"WhaUUUU! This is a intense dance between the senses of dark chocolate,  tobacco leaves and gooseberries,  blackberries and other wild and passionate dark berries,  it is TANGO! Piassola...."
16414,1191944,"Red Ruby.  Raspberry, Red cherry, Strawberry.  It took him time to open, but he brought out wonderful flavors, delicate, elegant, good acidity, medium-bodied. The beauty of wine."
16415,1191944,"RL = 3.9 (my rate) and VV=4.0 From the famous Portuguese region of Dão.  👁Dark Ruby with violet rimm 👃Very complex ripe fruit spectrum red & black: Plums, BlackBerry, strawberry, blueberry and cherries 💋 repeat the 👃 with round and robust tannins in balance to the ripe fruits layers and spices: black pepper claves together with tobacco leaves. 👚Robust 💫 Pleasant passage with spices prevalence ⏰Long stay...and a continous aftertaste  "
16416,1191944,"A rich nose with hints of kirsh, some forestfloor, lots of berries and cherries topped off with herbs. The same impression on the palate. This wine has a great body and a long, meaty finish.  This must be wonderful in a couple of years. A solid 4⭐️!"
16417,1191944,"[Portugal Collection tasting] This is more like it, I’m not yet a card-carrying member of the Dao fan club but this wine is doing its best to convince me. Nice nose with kirsch, fresh undergrowth and moss followed by a palate with pronounced acidity, nicely integrated tannines, cherry and raspberry. Room for further evolution too."
16418,1191944,"Another great wine from Dão from Álvaro Castro! dark violet with aroma of red fruits, slightly floral, with notes of resin, menthol and cocoa / chocolate. Full bodied with firm but well tamed tannins and persistent finish."
16419,1191944,"Warm rich woody and red fruits on the nose, palate follows the nose without being heavy, not sophisticated but a good crowd pleaser, highly drinkable on a cold afternoon"
16420,1191944,Ruby red color with violet and brownish tones. Some oak at nose. Tannins still alive at mouth. Could wait a little longer. 
16421,1662584,Very well balanced wine
16422,1662584,"Hints of big fruit, muted by even bigger wood that leaves traces of mint. Very inky. Again, silly cheap. 14%"
16423,1662584,Fruity and very delicate on the flavour
16424,1662584,Not as full bodied or rounded as waiter suggested. Disappointing for Douro
16425,1662584,Fruity. Value 4 money😉
16426,1662584,Delicious with a steak 
16427,1662584,"The best from Douro region. Simply the best. Intense, strong flavor."
16428,1662584,"Fresh, complex & well balanced "
16429,1662584,"Typical Douro wine , complex mature red berries, secondary aromas and the oak wood smooth  but very present . Full bodied and powerful"
16430,1662584,Nice structure. Great tannis. Tastes like a Spanish tempernello. Very very enjoyable 
16431,1662584,"Smooth, tastfull, hinds of almonds"
16432,1662584,"3.8, dark purple in glass, sweet cherries and plum on nose, velvet mouth feel with fruit finish, delicious blend of grapes including my favorite Portugese one-Touriga Nacional :)"
16433,1662584,"Cherry and oak. Full bodied, but would have expected a bit more muscle for a 2011"
16434,1662584,Perfect with rillettes and cassoulet 
16435,1662584,Frutos vermelhos maduros e final intenso.
16436,2867649,"Perfect wine for fantastic evening in jazz bar AveNew. Rich taste of black fruits,  plum, ripe sour cherry, oak, vanilla. Long aftertaste. Nicely tannic. Good pairing with beef carpaccio or lamb with smoked cheese. Yummy 😋 "
16437,2867649,"Nice wine in AveNew jazz bar in Lisbon. black fruit blackberry oak pepper black cherry. Complex and bold. BTW. If you look for a small jazz bar with atmosphere, this is a place for you. It is near Pombal plaza. Cheers. "
16438,2867649,Reminiscent of a typical Ribera del Duero tempranillo. Fruit forward with a creamy smoothness on the finish. Not super complex but definitely super drinkable 
16439,2867649,"Blend of touriga Nacional, tinta roriz and alfrocheiro. Garnet ruby colour, blackcurrant and cherry. Pepper, vanilla and farmyard. Made using a field blend. 14% alcohol, the 2017 vintage had good acidity, integrated tannins, rich fruits with a full body, blackberry persistent finish "
16440,2867649,Nice wine that I will try again 
16441,2867649,"black fruit , oak "
16442,2867649,"I’m going to have to look for more Dão wines because I’m falling in love!  Sweet plum, vanilla, blackberry and stone on the nose. More black fruits, black cherry, sweet vanilla coating the sides of your mouth, very expressive and aromatic wine, and a touch of oak on the palate. Light+ tannins, medium+ acidity and medium body. Medium+ finish. Very good."
16443,2867649,"Spicy plums, black currant, pepper and oak. Spicy bold palate."
16444,2867649,Smoky and buttery flavors. Fresh and ideal with fish.
16445,2867649,"Rich, fruity, well balanced and full bodied. Clesrly one to return too. Try it if you find it!"
16446,2867649,"Smooth, warm, medium heavy mouth feel."
16447,2867649,Balanced and complex. Notes of spices.  Great value for Money.
16448,2867649,Had this Dao red at one of good seafood joint at Matosinhos.  Too oaky and need some decanting before. Not ideal pairing for me because it has too much torque with some delicious seafood. 
16449,2867649,"Quite subtle fruit, with high tannic quite acidic and full bodied - nice but a bit muted overall if the flavours coming through compared to tannin and acidity "
16450,2867649,"Cedar, dates, sandalwood, red fruit. Long aftertaste that dries quickly into relatively tough tannins"
16451,1723060,A beautiful Syrah from Alentejo. This producer sounded a safe choice for me and I was not wrong. Great representation of a Syrah and great choice for a Friday night. 
16452,1723060,"Smells of red fruit, slightly oaky, medium dry and slightly acidic, the tannis are pleasant but not strong "
16453,1723060,3.7 I have not seen many Portuguese syrah.  This one was a complete different type of syrah. A few words Blackberry aromas followed by raspberry flavors.  Weird and different.  It grows on you.
16454,1723060, cherry red fruit dry light tannins balanced
16455,1723060,Kirsche toller Wein one of the best
16456,1723060,"Fruity, easy to drink, slightly acidic but not too bad at all "
16457,1723060,"Portuguese wines aren’t known for Syrah and this isn’t a bad effort to be fair. Very fruit forward, it’s all BlackBerry and oak on the smell and taste. Has some tannins to it but not overly so. It needs to mature for me, be  a little more complex with other things going on. It was nice with lamb but I wouldn’t say memorable."
16458,1723060,"Nice Syrah and with personality. Dark ruby color, some vanilla on nose, soft tannins, cherry, vanilla and oak notes. "
16459,1723060,Mmm so fruity! 
16460,1723060,A spicy oaky Syrah with dark fruits. A bit too powerful for me to really enjoy. 🐺 score 6/10
16461,1723060,This wine gives a taste definition to Smooth. It velvet in a bottle! It had the expected plum and cassis but also nutmeg. It worked very well with light meat and fish but it would not manage a tornedos.  
16462,1723060,"Tannins 3.5/5, Acid 2/5, Fruity 1/5, Complexity 3/5 - 1 is low, 5 is high "
16463,1723060,Dry and light with a notch of space
16464,1723060,Rich in fruit and very smooth 
16465,1723060,"Okay, vanilla hints of dark chocolate, not the usual Portuguese red, but I liked this a lot."
16466,1900355,"Fresh, citrus, brioche and butter aromas (autolysis) with pleasant acidity, crispy and fine bubbles. Creamy and balanced. "
16467,1900355,With 1st meal in Viseu.  Refreshing with very very fine bubbles.  Long finish.
16468,1900355,"Great fresh taste, with fruity flavors "
16469,1900355,"Simpel yet elegant. Salty, rich of minerals. "
16470,1900355,Dry but no fruit on it
16471,1900355,"Light straw color.  tropical fruit aroma with vegetable notes.  Fine bubble.  In the mouth is fresh and citric, with  toasted notes.  Nice finish.  A sparkling wine to taste."
16472,1900355,Very nice traditional method fizzy wine from Portugal. More body and depth than some Prosecco I have tasted. Brioche & apple notes. Great value from Lidl. Nice to try something a little different. Would agree with others the bubbles don't last as much as some other sparkling wines. 
16473,1900355,Cheesy at the nose. Very fresh floral and citrusy. Small delicate bubble. Lacks though body and length.
16474,1900355,"Medium lemon color, medium + intensity nose, lemon peel, white peach, grapefruit, wet stone, medium + acidity, elegant bubbles, medium finish"
16475,1900355,Dry Apple flavours and quite refreshing
16476,1900355,Just perfect for a plate of seafood at Pesqueiro 25 in Lisboa. Even though it is dry it has enough structure and sweetness to compliment various seafood. 
16477,1900355,"Also had this at OFICIO. This one is got more mineral than the Blanc de Noir. Grapes are Arinto and Bical. Minerals, oyster shells, salty citrus. Palate is elegant, fine bubbles. Both sparkling wines were great!"
16478,1900355,"Pale lemon color Very refreshing, medium intensity, apple notes, honeysuckle and toast notes. On the palate good acidity, stone fruits notes, red apple with medium finish "
16479,1900355,"Nice sparkling wine from Portugal, with nice toasty nose, fresh citrus and green peaches  Taste is also nice and fresh with medium plus acidity and nife long aftertaste.  Good- Very good wine "
16480,1900355,"Nice and fruity, good acidity, slight toastiness and  nice fine bubbles. Solid sparkling wine for a decent price."

16483,1305159,Some grass. Very light 
16484,1305159,Glamorous white with noble scents.
16485,1305159,"Bistro Barão lunch in Evora. 1/2. This Chardonnay and Sauvingon Blanc from Alentejo with 8 m FR barrel aging did not meet iur expectations. C: pale straw. N: very shy, line.

16491,1305159,Smoky and woody....
16492,6170444,"On the nose the moscatel shines through. On the tongue, honey, peach and rosewater. Long dry finish. A very pleasant and interesting wine."
16493,6170444,"Excellent! Complex on the nose and full of aromas (honey, peach, ripen fruit), acidic, mineral. This is my kind of white wine"
16494,6170444,"Field blend of more than 60 grapes varieties of old Vines from a single plot, single vineyard. Intense and expresive aromas of black fruits, prunes, violet involved with fresh aromas of oak, vanilla, pepper, licorice and wild flowers. Well integrated tannins, pleasant acidity, good structure and very long finish"
16495,6170444,"Beautiful nose, some honey, minerals, lightly nutty, vanilla. Palate is acidic and not very well balanced."
16496,6170444,Very nice balance and a lot of green fruits
16497,6170444,"Very interesting nose with citrus, ripe banana, wild flowers and flint. Mouth with citrus and minerality, creamy with high acidity. Good structure, long finish. Fine to be paired with food. "
16498,6170444,"Very impressive nose of nutty, minerals, stone fruit, peach, pear, toast.   The palate slightly brings down the wine. Hints of honey and citrus. Very round but not super concentrated. A long finish. "

16502,6170444,"Light golden color. Honeysuckle, fresh peach and apricot, undercurrent of slate, and white pepper on the nose. Slight cumin edge. Range of peach, kick of orange citrus, rose water, creamy minerality, slight tang on the back end. Mid-weight. Lovely compliment to rare sashimi tuna. Not particularly cheap though."
16503,6170444,Interesting white from Douro. It’s a field blend. Good bouquet with stone fruit and good acidity on the mouth
16504,6170444,"Flower, citrus, clean, oaky. Nice in the mouth and well balanced. I prefer the more playful moscatel galego. "
16505,6170444,"Another example of Portuguese class and real value for money. Balanced, smooth silky with some peppers and spice"
16506,6170444,"Pale yellow color.  Mineral aroma with citrus notes.  In the mouth it is bulky, with a very balanced structure and a vibrant acidity.  Very fresh and tasty.  Long aftertaste "
16507,6143513,"You cant tell if its a red or a wine, very interesting for the experience but difficult for me to drink it"
16508,6143513,"Light but a full body , very well balanced! Excellent drinking "

16516,5643278,"Perfect! Mature, mild and round. A grown up wine which is perfect with life."
16517,5643278, oak lemon vanilla butter
16518,5643278,"Like a Chardonnay / Albariño hybrid: buttery with vanilla and toasted almond, but with an undercurrent of lemon and grapefruit sorbet. "
16519,5643278,"Grapefruit palate, apricots on the nose. Subtle oak"
16520,5643278,Tasted at the FNA
16521,5643278,Strong flavoured. Not for the faint of heart. But very well balanced for a stronger fish dish
16522,5643278,"2016. Quite expressive and powerful over the palate, elegance is not the term, which occurs to me but it remains fresh with pronounced buttery and pastry notes, toasted almonds, oak was overwhelming right after opening but much better integrated 1 h. Nice find, lots of personality although I miss some fruit. 3.25🌟"

16527,1149939,"Always happy to find this kind of surprise a top wine crafted from old vines as field blend traditional from the Douro, an intense and complex red - 18 months in French barrel part new part used"
16528,1149939,"I bought this wine with Andrea Biaggi at Mercovino Ribeirão Preto. Deep intense red colour. Nose of dark red fruits with subtile spicy herbs. In mouth despite its 10 uears it presented itself fresh and vigorous with medium body, rounded up tanins, and fine flavours. Ended up with personality and persistance leaving a pleasant and prolonged fruity aftertaste. A typicall Douro to have handy when it that uncontrolable desire to eat codfish appears! Cheers!"
16529,1149939,Dry and slightly spicy. A bit flat compared to many other wines from Douro region
16530,1149939,"Absolutely fantastic, smoky blackberry and tobacco. Great elegant body! "
16531,1149939,"Quality to value a plus plus, bold aromas & flavours "
16532,1149939,"Trophy from Douro! Blend of 7+ grapes in FR oak. This bottle (1 out of 4045) born almost on the same day with my son 18y ago.   L: muddy dark ruby, classy stripes, still purple rims at abv.13%. Developing N: black currant, dark cherry centering with anise, licorice, forest floor intensely floating around. Blows of etheric oils, tar.   Bold but elegant P: vivid acidity, ripe tannins-full bodied, still fruit forward-amazingly perfect shape!  Mouth covering, rowan dry mid-way. Licorice, mint, peat finale. 4,3."

16535,1149939,"Fullbodied, really nice"
16536,1149939,"not as good as the previous vintage, but probably will evolve into it. Dark color with the scent of red fruits, mainly blackberry. The tannins are a bit hard yet, but you already feel a very long end.. to drink it again in 5 years..."
16537,1149939,"Criminally under rated based on my experience and a steal at what I payed for it! Very aromatic, slightly animalic nose with sweet, ripe prune and black fruit followed by a palate with more prune, tart, enjoyable acidity and perfect tannines. There is quite some sweetness that absolutely doesn’t bother as it is so constructive. There’s also a lot of power and long finish with vanilla and a bitter edge. Nice age, also for the vines (80 years) practically promises a good time! 4.3"
16538,1149939,"Velvety, elegant and pleasent"
16539,1149939,Nice balanced wine  with present taanines and fruity notes

16544,5113733,Fresh and a bit sour
16545,5113733,"Funky butte and oak nose. Perfect pairing with grilled octopus. Lime, oak,  butterscotch (San) on palate.  Had at bonbon (Michelin *) in Algarve."
16546,5113733,Clearly not bargain basement but you get what you pay for. It was both complex and sophisticated. A decent 4*
16547,5113733,"we are going to ear about this one, first name 😀"
16548,5113733,Notes of vanilla smooth very clean tasting fresh  
16549,5113733,Fruity not dry nice light wine easy to drink

16562,2657925,"Regular wine, nothing special besides the bottle…"
16563,2657925,"Deep black currant, plum and dark fruit notes. To taste it’s smooth, still black currant and dark fruit but lightened with cherry and vanilla. A very enjoyable red. "
16564,2657925,"Not quite a full 4.0 but a solid red from the Douro Valley. Notes of dark cherry, raspberry, plum, and some oak. A whiff of vanilla and earth makes it a smooth quaff."
16565,2657925,"Strong dark fruit like blackberry on the nose. To taste, a bit acidic but fruit-forward and not overly tannic. Easy to drink, has structure but nothing that makes it particularly memorable. "
16566,2657925,"@4.0 for this Portuguese deep red. Nice character of rich berry and cherry, tobacco, hints of vanilla but won’t knock out your taste buds when the glass temperature rises. "

16571,1288299,"Vintage 2015: concentrated yet balanced and smooth forest fruit mixture...jammy blueberries, spices, menthol and licorice or even smokey tones with a hint of tobacco to set its firm character. A character that yet needs to unfold some of its secrets although the palate gives away hints of the some mysteries ahead: a refreshing acidity fused with a lingering bonfire finish of concentrated ripeness, chocolate and a herbal touch"
16572,1288299,Very smooth wine. Surprising
16573,1288299,"Great red Douro from Touriga National and Touriga Franc Apperance: dark purple, almost pitch black Nose: its complex, starts with sweet cherry later vanilla, and cedar wood Palate: structured, bold, off-dry, medium acidicy, lots of well balanced tannins Long finish. black cherry dark chocolate but later also fig leather  and anise  Can drink now, possibly can age more.

16575,1288299,"Absolutely incredible. Big oak flavours, but well rounded due to its age, with back notes of vanilla. Had with a fillet steak - sublime!"
16576,1288299,"Dark colour. Hints of chocolate, prune, some vanilla. Complex ending. "
16577,1288299,Very balanced and tasty wine! Great value! Serious wine at a good price. 
16578,1288299,"Grande Reserva - elegant and tasty. Made from rigorous selected Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca. Full-bodied and very complex. Ripe black fruits, dark chocolate and vanilla aromas."
16579,1288299,"Serious Grande Reserva blended from Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, probably still a bit too young but the quality is obvious.  Intense nose with fine oak, black cherry, black pepper, warm prune and undergrowth followed by a palate with pronounced acidity augmented by nicely cooperative tannins, lots of still fresh red & black fruit, licorice and capped off with a nice finish. 4.0"
16580,1288299,"Very good red Grande Reserva  from Douro,  a deep purple color with violet nuances.  Nose: ripe black cherry, blueberries, ripe black berries and ripe raspberries, a little bit of licorice, chocolate and oak nuances.  In the mouth: black wild forest berries, blackberries, blueberries, and also cherry, dark chocolate, spices, vanilla, anise, cinnamon, a lot of balsamic herbs tones, and lightly smoked cherry wood.  Wine, juicy, fruity, velvety, medium body with good structure.  Finish, fresh, balanced."
16581,1288299,"100% Sousao. Savoury, leathery, liquorice, acidic, tannic... this is a pretty edgy wine with some serious punch to it. I only wished we had more time to enjoy as this wine was tight... For its level of complexity, it can certainly see aging and has a long window for greater potential."
16582,1288299,"Beautiful, deep & dark Red berries, Cocoa, flesh, leather, eucalyptus and fresh mint. Complex and very pleasant nose.  Very nice attack, great acidity and well integrated wood, smooth velvety but present tannins. Peppered long lasting and pleasant ending.  Incredibly young although with 9 years, great wine and a great candidate to cellar and forget you have it for a decade or more. "
16583,1497085,Full of pineapple notes 🍍
16584,1497085,A bit yellow for its age. Well matured on the nose with some notes of honey. Citric on the mouth. Medium finish. A would like a bit more acidity.

16588,1497085,Fruity and fresh. Great summer wine and good value

16602,1893716,"Garage wine series, I missed a good wine from Douro, lately I have tasted a lot of wine from Alentejo.  👃 imposing as expected because of the year, lots of spices and wood( maybe some American or French oak), leather, dark chocolate, mint and dark fruit.  🍷 a bit disappointed with the body, light bodied, simple and light texture, medium acidity, good tannins and a decent aftertaste."

16605,1893716,Outstanding. Black fruit and pencil shavings 
16606,1893716,"Nicely balanced. Ripe fruit (blackberry, plum) with moderate tannin and oak. Stood up nicely to spice. Just the barest hint of sweetness. Lovely."
16607,1893716,"Real tasty wine with great qpr. Delicious ripe red fruits with strawberry, cherry cola and blueberry. Tobacco, ash, clove give depth and there is a nice acidity that clears with way for mod tannins. Finishes nicely, although a touch sweet to start it develops well and did well with a thorough decant. "
16608,1893716,"30% Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), 30% Touriga Franca, 30% Touriga Nacional and 10% misc., this wine delivers a rich purity of baked red fruit (particularly red currant) and baked plum, alongside cinnamon and fruitcake spice.  Medium+ velvety tannins, m+ acid and m+ alcohol. Yum. "
16609,1893716,"4.1..  Made from organically grown grapes. Not as full throttled as many Douro reds can be. Juicy red fruit and tobacco notes. Fine, grainy tannins. It’s medium bodied and fits this producer’s style to a Tee."

16617,3862528,"An ‘Alentejano’ made with Syrah, Touriga Nacional, Franca and Aragonês. Pstaged 22 months In new French Oak barrels. This 2012 is just perfect to drink as of today. Granade with ruby borders, starts shy but assuringly in the nose, with complexity, hints of berries, cocoa, green vegetables, flowers, sweet plums and syrup.  Fresh and smooth attack, firm and velvety tannins, great acidity and long lingering and ‘agreable’ finale.   "

16628,3862528,Very pleasant wine!
16629,3862528,Great example of a solid wine from the Alentejo region of Portugal. Full bodied red that's so easily drunk. I need more..
16630,3862528,"Black cherry, blackcurrant, marzipan, sweet spices, well integrated fruit characters balanced by oak, not much in the way of tertiary flavours for another few years I think. Lovely drop though."
16631,3862528,Rich dark deep. tastes like a wine cellar. In a great way. Earth chalk oak plum. Beautiful
16632,2001042,"In price range of course Wine reflects the Atlantic influence, which translates into a very particular freshness and acidity;  at the same time, it presents an excellent minerality, resulting from the predominantly clay-limestone soils  40 km north of Lisbon, one step from the sea, in a region of moderate temperatures and permanent sea breezes.  Touriga Nacional is a deepbodied red very complex and mineral. Great value under USD$ 12"
16633,2001042,Ripe black fruit in nose. Berries and jam with some oak on the palate. Bold with moderate to high tannins.
16634,2001042,"14.5%, 12m in French oak. cherry, shortbread, biscuits, butter, caramel, spicy, oak as much, deep. Aroma is better than taste.  Strong Cheese power."

16636,2001042,oak vanilla black cherry cassis 
16637,2001042,"Interesting wine.  Small nose but big bouquet .. full of fruits, flowers, earth, tar.. Worth trying with good cheese 😊"
16638,2001042,I found the Touriga Franca much better in every possible way.
16639,2001042,"Oak, some blackberry, very full-bodied wine, but it smells better, than it tastes. "
16640,2001042,Simple nice dark fruit smooth wine 
16641,2001042,Heavy & great! 
16642,2001042,Fruits rouges … 👍

16644,2001042,"Vivino average 3.9 spot on for this Lisboa TN aged 10m in 40% new French barriques. Great value too.  Med purple. Bright & fruity w. floral top notes. Dried dark flowers, violet, leafy black cherry, raspberry, mulberry & creamy blackberry. Soft vanillin, a touch of anise & cassis. Youthful.  Dry.

16647,1200518,"Pear, apple, citrus, grass and pineapple. A touch of saline and stone on the palate as well. Very crisp and refreshing. Great qpr!"
16648,1200518,Bright and fresh but with body that I don’t expect from al(b)varhinõ... almost syrupy when you really concentrate on it. Sharp acid. Delicious.
16649,1200518,"Beautifully fragrant, elegant and easy to drink. One of the better bottles around. Impressively holds its weight with a wide variety of seafood. Well priced and delicious bottle!"
16650,1200518,"I’d enjoyed the ‘17 vintage of this in a Lisbon restaurant last February so, when I saw this for sale a few months later in Faro Airport duty free, I had to pick up a bottle. Probably not quite as good but still a great patio wine in the Scottish summer sun (who knew?!!). Driven by lemon character with underlying minerality and a touch of saline. Med+ acidity as you’d expect."
16651,1200518,"When we talk about Alvarinho our minds run to Anselmo Mendes and when we talk about him, we necessarily think of the Alvarinho variety. He is known in the wine world as Mister Alvarinho or Alvarinho King for his tireless and uninterrupted work in the knowledge of this variety. Full bodied wine, subtly fragrant, complex with delicate and discreet of peach, lemon, passion fruit, lychee, orange zest, jasmine, orange blossom and lemon balm. The wine has a very high aging potential, rich, textured and structured"
16652,1200518,"Lots of citrus mixed with pear, fresh summer flowers and minerals. Mature yellow fruit on the palate. Lightly carbonated. Quite acidic.  Nice wine that likely pairs well with many types of food. Worked nicely with grilled seabass. "
16653,1200518,"[PT in comments] Another beautiful Alvarinho by Anselmo Mendes.  Very intense of tasty pineapple, lemon, peach, honey. Excellent fruit. Fresh grass.  Good minerality, good acidity, fresh.  Long citric and grassy finish.  Not being extraordinarily complex, everything about feels right. Very very good.  It went well with grilled salmon and later with boiled codfish."
16654,1200518,"Great Portuguese white wine  from Vinho Verde, 100% Alvarinho a lively straw-yellow color with greenish reflexes.  Nose: ripe citrus and bright ripe fruits, white spring flowers and big minerals.  In the mouth: juicy ripe citrus, lemon, pink grapefruit, gooseberry, green apple, mineral accents.  Wine soft, juicy, fresh, with nice fruity acidity,  with a great mineral accents at the finish."
16655,1200518,"Citrus and slightly tropical notes. Yellow flavours like orange peel, yellow apple; peach, stone fruit. Dry on the palate, citrus again, green apple, with minerality, saltines and medium acidity. Dry finish with the light bitter citrus."
16656,1200518,This is a dry & crisp wine with a great mixture of of citrus fruits tropical fruit & a hint of pear really nice. 
16657,1200518,"Bright, fresh wine, with pear, green apple and lemon. Wasn’t paying attention and then suddenly - half a bottle gone."

16662,3817636,"[Alves de Sousa PW 1/5] Served by Mr. de Sousa himself, fantastically pure and authentic in a way no marketing buff can ever be. We stated we wanted to focus on red but he insisted we’d try this gem of a white! Am I glad we listened! This is one of the best Portuguese whites I ever had. Complex from the nose with lemon, toast and characterful oxidated notes to the fresh palate with perfect acidity, sherry impressions, oak and beeswax and into the long finish. 4.3"
16663,3817636,"Much developed oaky nose which reminds me of some aged Rioja white. Intense aroma of vanilla, jasmine, spices with hints of yogurt. Dry, medium plus acidity, medium body, 13% alcohol. Great to pair curry and nuts. I enjoyed it very much. "
16664,3817636,Bouquet of warmed caramel with a tounge of toasted vanilla clay combing an underlying mineral effect that falls off the tounge with a gentle saline wash and finishes among a tinge of pleasing acidity with an obtuse  silk-like ending. This is a most perfect and extraordinary production that deserves high praise!
16665,3817636,"Made from white port grapes and given long ageing, this has nutty, oxidative character. Very dry finish, unusual. Needs food"
16666,3817636,"It’s a good wine, but not my to my personal taste for drinking on its own. It would work good with food though. Heavy apple beeswax minerals"
16667,3817636,"It’s always something special, having wine with the winemaker himself. In this case an icon who put out the lines for the “new Douro vague”, Mr. D. De Sousa. We wanted to go for the reds but were we glad he insisted to start with this one! A little oxidative hint but so fresh at the same time,  ofcourse mature and complex. I’m wondering if this wine had malo...? Anyway, a little gem we were handed out by a very nice man!"
16668,3817636,"Light elegant aromatic oak stone fruit aromas, beautifully rounded soft tannins and minerality, memories of sea breeze over the Duoro hills, sour apple apricot honey toasted almonds caramel with complex smooth finish "
16669,3817636,94pts me  What a wine!!! A portugese white wine from douro with more than 10 grapes blended   Aged for 7 years in bottle   oxidative style similar to a Lopez todonia yet it offers more minerality from the old vine and pre phylloxera vineyard   Roasted pear saffron ginger smokey honey suckle on a long baked walnutty flavor   Medium plus acid rich flavor yet medium body and somewhat light and dancing on your palate   Amazingly flavorful on a long mineral finish   Like musar meets chablis
16670,3817636,Almost orange in colour. 19 Euro a bottle. Best of Portugal during Essência de Vinho concourse in Porto 2016. Almost 5 star. A little bit too alcohol.
16671,3817636,"Golden orange in colour. Apple, soft citrus, orange peels, honey, caramel and hints of dried herbs. Rounded acidity and smooth finish. Quite similar to an orange wine."
16672,3817636,Beautiful wine. Tiny production. Aromas of yeasts but keeping lively freshness and being a 2008 vintage !  Wonderful white 
16673,3817636,"Almost-Orange Portuguese! 10-grape blend, 48 hrs skin contact, 6 m new oak aging+9 yrs in bottle before release in 2015. Thanks Joao Passos! & Simon Woolf for writing about it.

16680,2351986,"Light, fruity, complex rosé😍 @Sonja Horelli loves this"
16681,2351986,"Yellow, greenish color, with moderate acidity. Good flavors and aromas of citrus fruit. Lots of strong oak notes. Sweet. Hot profile. In terms of smell and taste, it is a pleasant white, for those who enjoy  oaked and sweet wine  (which is not really my case. I didn't appreciate it very much).         Contains sulphites. I applaud alcohol at 12.5 ° because it is a moderate value that makes wine more friendly and therefore more gastronomic."
16682,2351986,"3.75* very good QPR.  Citrics, crispy but with a creamy and mineral touch too. Very easy drinking white Alentejo 🇵🇹 wine. "
16683,2351986,"Trip to Portuguese land with @[1|7741911|Boris Sarin] & @[1|8023512|Jeff Sauvage] (2/6).   Beautifully intense nose, charming, where mixes with harmony perfumes of apples, kiwis, bananas, peaches, passion fruits, citrus as well as more floral & herbaceous notes. Well balanced mouth, with fat and minerality at the end of the palate that stretches the whole. And especially, a more marked acidity that brings some ""boost"". Nice wine. My rate : 3.75🌟"
16684,2351986,"2018. $20.65. A nice departure for what we've come to expect from Portugese Alvarinho. Noticeable lack of the fruity nose and honeyed taste were used to, this has strong minerality, butter and stone fruit. Quite dry and very pleasant with food, awesome value at 20 bucks. 3.8/5"

16691,2351986,"Second of two white wines tasted during the evening in Lisbon. Much more better than first one. Light-straw colour in the glass with delicate green hints. On the nose palette of fresh citrus fruits. What a smell!!! In the mouth lot of fruits of citrus, peach, lime, grapefruit, lemon, melon, pear, green apple with very delicate herbs. I still can bring the taste in my mind. That was very interesting mix of fresh citrus fruits and herbs. At the finish minerals. I am sure I will try one more bottle of this 🥂"
16692,2351986,"Nice! Between 3,5 and 4 but quite close to 4...a bit too acidic which damages the overall balance. Despite that the fruit is lovely, peachy on the nose, very citric on the palate and long. A good white from Avery consistent producer"
16693,2351986,"Great white from Alentejo! A rich blend of Alvarinho and Sauvignon Blanc, from the Atlantic coast vines, with Viognier, from inland vines, partially aged in French oak barrels. Deep and complex, with vivid acidity and very good length. Golden yellow color, mineral, citrus, peach and apricots aromas/flavors, with notes of spices, honey, an hint of vanilla and well integrated oak. Dry, creamy and fresh, with a nice long finish.

16719,1226145,"Yes, yes and yes. Light up front yet somehow full, like when I step on a scale. I would drink a bottle of this without a second thought."
16720,1226145,"Amazing wine!! Not a 5* just as a principle. Strong body, amazing aromas, long taste in the mouth. Great! Independent of the year, Monte da Peceguina never lets you down!"
16721,1226145,"Took a fair but of air but very good mature nose with reasonably balanced acid, you can  taste the 14% in the finish but it's not overpowering."

16725,6454628,"91/100 This translates to mother’s foot. Trincadeira aged for 18 months in foudoures. This has a nose of black raspberry, violets, pepper, and tobacco. This has depth and distinction. For a wine from Alentejo, this has a lot of elegance. Tart fruit flavors and high acidity with firm tannins. After bottle age this should become quite Pinot Noir-esque. Only the second vintage of this wine, but it should age well. "

16755,2372259,"One of my favorites of the tasting. Marialva likes to sit on their wines to make sure they are not opened too quickly. That’s right up my alley! Here Baga works excellently together with Touriga Nacional, making the most of 12 months in toasted French barrels.  Perfume nose with balsamic, mint, raspberry, red cherry and that toasted oak from the barrels.The same fresh, juicy sensations in the palate with perfect acidity and dry, constructive tannins!

First bottle I rated 4🌟. 4,25🌟 seems to correct for this stunning wine of a beautiful deep ruby red colour an amazing bouquet and flavours of rich blackberry, raspberry, plum with skillfully interwined nuances of herbs, spices, cocoa, vanilla. Slightly herbaceous and earthy. Full-bodied, great tannins."

16778,73949,"This is a good wine but absolutely not my taste... aromas reminded me of artificial red fruit bubblegum. Velvety mouthfeel, smooth tannins and a rather long finish. Reading the other descriptions here makes me wonder if I grabed a faulty bottle... "

Never gonna push to 4.5 but a very competent 4.1 and, setting aside the €13.49 I paid, this is the sort of wine I need to drink more of!"

16891,5376404,"Dryer and more acidic than German late harvest Rieslings, it still has grapey, almost muscatelly notes on the finish. A keeper. "
16892,5376404,"3,8⭐My first Riesling tasting. 👀Deep golden yellow. Slow tears.  👃Orange zest, grapefruit and a hint of minerals touch. 👅Medium-full bodied. Balanced and with spot on acidity. 🗒️This show a profile different from every white I have tried so far. Feels a little liquorish, but still is not sweet. Not really gastronomic (for me) but goes well at the end of the meal by itself. 😁"
16893,5376404,"Зашкаливающий пиаш! Я не знаю сколько, по ощущению все 2.8! Pale gold bright color Nice aroma full of expectation for wet leaves, oily, dried apricot, silky nectar. But. Rubber, wet apple, lemon juice. Extremely high acidity. rustic, too natural style. Even for me.  13% 2017 "

16901,5376404,Good surprise. Very mineral and not boring at all. Drinking very well but surely with some potential to age and to develop the more classic Riesling notes which are now just apparent
16902,5376404,"🇵🇹 Muito agradável este Riesling da Beira Interior, tem uma cor palha claro, nariz vegetal e cítrico destaque de toranja, algumas notas florais, na boca é seco com muita frescura, bom volume e suavidade, uma acidez fina, termina longo.  🇬🇧 Very pleasant this Riesling from Beira Interior, has a light straw color, vegetable nose and citrus highlight of grapefruit, some floral notes, in the mouth it is dry with lots of freshness, good volume and smoothness, a fine acidity, long finish.

Smells like it would be a brusier but it's quite medium-bodied on the palate with high acidity. Slightly grippy tannins. Well done for a minimal intervention red. "
16955,6654643,"Somewhat cloudy bordeaux color to this wine with little tearing as the alcohol percentage is low for a red. Mineral as well as summer fruit on the nose with a nice light, mineral taste on the palate. Had it slightly chilled and it pairs well like this with red meats, seafood, strong cheese and I would recommend it as an aperitif wine when chilled. "

16989,1295490,Lovely wine - purple hue with rubber and earth tones; taste of licorice and blueberries; nice acidity and fruit forward. Good tannins and taste lingers long. Needs time to open and is still tight as it’s young. Great value. 91 points.
16990,1295490,"Quick notes from vineyard visit and tasting in Q de S.José.  Nice! but still young!  Red, thin bluish rim. Full body, plenty of acidity, nice tannins.

16998,1295490,"Part of the new trend of high quality Portuguese wines hitting North American shores, we’re finally learning this small country is so much more than Port. Hailing from the Douro, same as Port, and using Touriga Nacional (a native grape with huge potential) and Touriga Franca. Very deep purple in colour, aromatics and flavours of cassis, black plum, graphite, oak char, with some leather and vanilla. Big ripe tannins. Can hold for a few years. Give these wines a try if you’re a California Cab Sauv fan."

17008,4260850,Will lay the next bottle down
17009,4260850,"Stone, brioche and unripe pear. Quite high acidity that tickles the back of your tongue. Had it with Mexican and it paired very nicely."

17011,4260850,"A superior Arinto. Discrete nose suggesting orange and a hint of development (cheesy hay) (3 years old at time of drinking). Palate showing mineral and citrus (lemon, orange, grapefruit) as well as a 'sweeter' shade of perhaps resiny pine. Has structure, subtlety and finesse to go with that Arinto acidity. (average vine age >30yrs; Arinto ""exclusivamente""; bica aberta; partial fermentation/maturation in used oak; 12% abv)."

17058,1255594,Amazing wine! The age of the vineyards is easy to fill on the mouth for a long time. Fruit and fresh QB! Great wine!
17059,1255594,"This was so good, smooth, vanilla, tabaco, a little roughness in the mouth."
17060,1255594,great balancw between acidity and minerals. 
17061,1255594,"It has a shiny citrus color.  The aroma is delicate, with notes of fruits and flowers. In the mouth is structured and creamy, with marked acidity Long and attractive finish."
17062,1255594,Seems like a quality wine but definitely not my style.  Too sweet upfront for me. 
17063,1255594,Full and fruity on the finish

17072,1706208,Chocolate up front together with plum black fruit and oak. Smooth tannins and medium plus finish. Great for the price!
17073,1706208,"Excellent wine : one of the best combinations of aragonez, cabarnet Sauvignon, Syrah and Alicante bouchet gives it a mix of flavour and taste which for me symbolises alentwjo wines perfectly. "
17074,1706208,Very pleasant. A good quality price relation.

17076,1706208,"Revisiting again. Uncork’d, Jun/2018. Cheers!"
17077,1706208,Very good wine!!
17078,1706208,This was our last wine from yesterday afternoon. What a nice Alentejano!
17079,1706208,"Actually a 3,8 to this Alentejano, crafted by grapes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Aragonês and Alicante Bouschet, aged for 12 months in French and American oak barrels, had a dark ruby in color, bringing aromas of very ripe black fruits in the form of jam, coffee and  certain minerality with wood  being discreetly present. From medium to full body, the tannins are tame but still angry which makes it have a long and persistent finish. Still young. Better wait at least five years to taste it."
17080,1597554,"Bought it by mistake....thought I was buying their white....hahahahahaha.  However, it was delicious, fruity and smooth....even better as it was shared with good friends! "
17081,1597554,"Eyes: Deep purple  Nose: Intense aromas of violet, blackberry, black plum, blueberry, bouquets of clove, milk chocolate  Palette: Dry, medium(+) acidity, hard tannin, full-bodied, medium(+) finish "

17083,1597554,"Very good Touriga Nacional with deep purple color and elegant aromas of black fruit like blueberry, blackberry and plum and flowers like violet. Balanced with pleasant texture and structure, lovely smooth tannins and good acidity. Discreet and fine cigar box aroma with long finish. Very high aging potential "
17084,1597554,"Great intensity of flavours and rich layers of black cherries, ripe red prunes, clove and hints of sour cherries. Full bodied, silky tannins long finish"
17085,1597554,"A great profile red with character, pleasant finesse and nice firm tannins, nice concentration easy to drink- a good buy"
17086,1597554,"Big, dense, acidic mouthfeel with bitter dark chocolate and red fruit. Muted nose with a bit of hazelnut. Kinda cool. Dusty tannins. Needs lots of air to shine. 3.8. "
17087,1597554,"(92/100) 100% Touriga Nacional,   Fragrant nose with a lot of finesse, violets, raspberries and blueberries.  Fresh, oak perfectly integrated, powerful and serious, gives a long and juicy finish."
17088,1597554,"This was delicious. So much fruit on the nose with a decadent opaque purple color. Blackberry, plum, vanilla, tobacco. Incredibly well balanced. Acidic enough to drink on a hot summer night. "
17089,1597554,Viva la Portugal.  Very pleasant blend. Somewhat fragrant on the nose and medium tannins. A half star for value- nice with tequila lime chicken. Will not hesitate to pick up again.
17090,1597554,"Well...the bouquet is definitely like a good Pinot. The color would point to a full body but it is not. In the end the wine defies your senses with a balanced, medium body with fresh and crispy taste."
17091,1597554,"Good Wine. Very fresh Fruity nose, very perfumed, very seductive nose. On the palate very fresh and well made with higher acidity. Will age well and is drinking very well. A fresher style of Dão with beautiful integration and showing the potential of Nacional in this amazing region"
17092,1597554,"2nd wine of Portugal Dão region tasting meeting, made of 💯% Touriga Nacional grapes aged for 12 months in used French oak barrels. Dark purple red color. Nice, intense, complex ripe red and black fruit aromas with hints of oak, spices, pimento and, lately, chocolate. Medium-bodied (13.5%), very well-balanced wine disclosing nice, proper acidity and alcohol and velvety, elegant tannins. Finish is smooth, slightly dry, savory and persistent. A 93-GB pts beautiful, delicious wine!! Highly recommend!!"
17093,1597554,"93 Pt Parker!  Color:Dark ruby/purple color  Nose:Very expressivee, bright raspberry,hints of smoke and flowers.  Palate: in the mouth is very rich,smooth and voluptuous with a velvet texture filled with plun,black tea,dark cherry,chocolate and vanilla.  Finish: Finishes longround and soft  Strong body with acidity very balanced, but also so young.You must give at least more 5-8 years to improve in bottle.  Note:92"
17094,1597554,"A refined and well-crafted red, with concentrated flavors of dried cherry, red raspberry and currant, supported by fleshy, medium-grained tannins. Delivers a long finish of tar, spice and smoke."
17095,2540669,"Soft, impressive, easy drinking. Amazing structure "
17096,2540669,"Great mineral and citric flavor, and well balanced vanilla notes. A small fatness appears. Would be great to some grilled seafood or light meat."
17097,2540669,"Weekend with friends from the gastronomy & travel group.  Bargain! Tropical fruits on nose, gastronomic acidity, creamy.  Rate 3.8"
17098,2540669,"Crystalline and intense citrus color. Predominant aroma of melon very ripe, with notes of toast. In the mouth it is fruity and fresh. Average finish. great price."

17101,2540669,"Wow! Refrescante, macio, damasco..."
17102,2540669,Staying local. Goes well with freshly boiled Brussels sprouts 
17103,2540669,"4,3. - same notes as before. Just a great white wine that is cheaper than most at the same level "
17104,2540669,"Excellent, robust, apple, crisp, smooth, slate. "
17105,2540669,"tasted briefly - has a poise and a nice 'tingle', but showing too much vanilla. (Adega Coop de Cantanhede; unfiltered; 13.5% abv)."
17106,2540669,"Arinto keeps impressing me, such a versatile grape capable of ultra fresh quaffers but also, like here, complexer types benefitting from judicious barrel aging. In this case 50% of the grapes spent time in French oak.  Mineralic nose with vanilla, buttered toast, lemon and grapefruit followed by an oily palate with lemon, peach, mango and oak. Just had to bring a bottle home to see what a couple of years might do. 4.0  "
17107,2540669,"One of the best Arinto’s I have drunk.. Surprisingly, because although the vintners goes back to the 1600s - it’s still a “just” a competent medium to large scale wine factory. Arinto‘s trait comes with a narrow and slender approach - here there must be a couple of chemical improvements to this wine – the mouth feel is fantastic, fruit integrated though the vanilla which comes from 6 m. in 50% new oak, is a bit in front. But here’s the question, if I can’t detect the chem tricks - it must be a good wine?? "
17108,2540669,"Yellow, greenish color, with moderate acidity. Good flavors and smells of citrus and tropical fruit. Sweet. In terms of smell and taste, it is a pleasant white from Bairrada region, for those who enjoy sweet wine  (which is not my case).         Contains sulphites.           "
17109,2540669,"Considering it's an Arinto, it's well soft at the edges but with a flinty heart. €8.95 PV"
17110,8277349,"Fruity, fresh & enjoyable both together with a meal or on its own for casual sipping. Well worth trying and coming back to."
17111,8277349,I don’t know if the price is correct as we had it in a restaurant with a wonderful fish. It went really well with the meal. 
17112,8277349,Very nice. Local wine good to swordfish;)
17113,8277349,"Decent white, fair price "
17114,8277349,"Encorpado, adocicado no final"
17115,8277349,"Another good time with this one. 👁 pale yellow color. 👃 apple, pear, citrus and honey. 👅 good accidity, better with food."
17116,2501397,"3.9 New interesting grape from Portugal, in the aroma it has a lot of pepper like Syrah. Medium acidity, medium body, medium/long aftertaste. Blackberry, tobacco, pepper, chocolate, plum, dark fruit."
17117,2501397,"Dry but a nice balance and round aftertaste. Oak flavor along with cherry. Very price worthy wine, even nice to drink on its own. "
17118,2501397,"Garnet color. Smooth red fruit aroma, with vegetable and chinese ink notes. In the mouth is   very juicy, dry and shows polished tannins. Medium and tasty aftertaste. Very gastronomic, accompanied very well a roasted veal lunch."

17120,2501397,"Very dark ruby color, nice smells of cherry and black currant, tastes of cherry, black currant, soft pepper and tannins "
17121,2501397,Cortesia do Nelson. Categoria 👍👍👍 23/07/2021
17122,2501397,"This wine is made from Alfrocheiro Preto, a red Portuguese wine grape grown in Dao. The first thing you notice about the wine is the colour. Its very dark. This continues on the nose with dark fruits of blackberry, plum and cherry. Fairly bold wine with lasting tannins and definitely on the dry side with chocolate and oak from 12 months in the barrel."
17123,2501397,Slight oak taste Very smooth and dry  Goes well with meat and fish
17124,2501397,"fantastic, complex wine. heavier than older vintageI know, fuller. confiture red fruit, hint of tobacco, late plum. balsamic aromas. rich, intelectual wine. 92"
17125,2501397,"Interesting boutique producer. Mature wine, concentrated. I am not great fun of Portuguese wine but this on was correct. Recommend with cold cuts."
17126,2501397,A great pleasure
17127,2501397,"Very tasty Portuguese red wine from Dão Dark ruby red color  with purple reflexes. Wine with great structure, medium to full body, great concentration, aroma of black wild forest fruits, blackberries, black fleshy cherries, balsamic herbs, strong spices, nice minerality  Finish elegant, clear and very durable."
17128,2501397,"Black berries and black current. Soft tannins, really nice mid palate. Approachable and ready to drink at this point. Herbal on the nose with the aforementioned dark fruit. A very nice alternative from the mainstream. In it s prime and a fun wine. "
17129,2501397,"Extremely engaging! Rustic in a very pleasant way. Nose: black olives, leather, animal hide, baked tomato, a bit of smoke... Black fruit on the palate, but quite seasoned, with minerality, tobacco and bold, but subtle tannins which become stronger with decantation. Interesting sensation: it's round and easy in the mouth, but ends with long, warming, dry finish.  Very opaque and deep dark red, almost black.  We paired with with tom.ato sauce fresh pasta - very good choice."
17130,2501397,Very cool wine with a dark ruby ​​color in the aroma and taste dark fruit in the background red fruit notes oak chocolate tobacco pepper smoke well balanced high acidity slightly delicate tannin good wine solo.🍇🍷👍🏻😃👌🏻
17131,1799282,New vine. New taste. New feel.
17132,1799282,"Earthy, blackcurrant, full body, rather delicious! "
17133,1799282,"Punches above its weight, delightful! Bright red cherry but rounded out beautifully by a deep earthiness of smoke and gravel, along with notes of anise and fennel that really bring it gorgeous depth and gravitas. Really very lovely. "
17134,1799282,"Catch up notes & another complex field blend of 14 varieties including Trincadeira, Aragonez, Alicante Bouschet, Grand Noir, Tinta de Olho Branco & Castelão. Aged 2yrs in oak.

17135,1799282,"Full bodied wine without the heavy tannins. Delicate, fruity and enough complexity and flavours to age some years. And then, it will be much better."
17136,1799282,"Dark ruby color with nice tearing. Notes of caramel, vanilla, dark chocolate, forest berries and oak with a nice crisp, dry finish. Pairs with red meat, oily fish, strong cheese and bitter chocolate desserts. "

17138,1799282,"Alentejo wine bought this year at Porto city, made of Alicante Bouschet, Tinta Caiada, Trincadeira, Aragonez, Castelão grapes.  Dark ruby to grenade red color. Intense, complex ripe red/black fruit/plum preserve aromas, notes of wood, spices, veggies, wet earth, toasted coffee, leather.

Deserves 94-GB pts! At its peak!! 👏👏👏👏👏"
17139,1799282,"Balanced, fruity aroma, silky, fennel and cigar notes, mid body,  easy to drink "
17140,1799282,Lovely organic wine with very soft tannins.  This is a complex wine who’s appearance would have you think it is far younger than it is.  A very earthy wine with hints of wood and  undergrowth almost.  I liked it very much but question the price for the quality.
17141,1799282,"15 grapes... don't know them all, secret from the house. Vineyard of 100 years old! A complex but intrigent wine... pure enjoyment!"
17142,1799282,Light burgundy-like Alentejo red. 
17143,1799282,A “light” Alantejo…
17144,1799282,"Well made, perfectly balanced. Nice rich fruit caracther, fresh, persistent and long. Good red"
17145,1799282,Rich but not too heavy. Perfect
17146,1594682,A very special wine made in the wrong place: the west coast of Portugal. It is a mineral and salty wine. You notice some acidity but if you like the style this is a great achievement. Very low production so drink it fresh and savory it.
17147,1594682,"Excellent minerality, dry and with just enough fruit."
17148,1594682,"Very excited to drink this White 🇵🇹 Colares for the first time. Colares DOC is a ”endangered” wine region in the suburbs of Lisbon that is rapidly disappearing from the ever expanding sprawl having shrunk from around 2,500 to approximately 25 acres.  The vines also happen to be some of the oldest in Portugal.   👃 Ripe Green Apple,  mineral, white pepper 👅 Very dry, clean, Lemon peel, almost a weak cayenne pepper, crab apple, cayenne wet stone, sharp finish  I liked but a little too dry mineral for me"
17149,1594682,"Many citrus fruits (lemon, grapefruit), as well as vanilla and butter aroma. Good, but not worth the money"
17150,1594682,"Pronounced collage  Nice, light dry white wine"
17151,1594682,"3.9 medium lemon. In nose: wax, minerals, honey,smoke, hay, lime, lemon, grapefruit. Really attractive. Smooth and palate coating. "
17152,1594682,"Great example of bone dry Malvasia. Golden colour. Nose of wax, lemon, white flower. Salty, almost sherry like palette, lemon, olive, pink grapefruit. Great acidity and length. Very moreish and sold in 50cl bottle that leaves you wanting more 🥂"
17153,1594682,"Wine number two (for some reason we are only allowed to taste 4 wines each, so have dropped the entry level which is described as unpretentious!).  Very different style 100% Malvasia from sandy soils. Stainless steel ferment and 6 months in old BrazilIan 🇧🇷 barrels.   White blossom, touch of minerality, salty austere long finish.   Great, more my style than the first wine.   "
17154,1594682,"You can smell flower notes mixture with honey, and the after-taste is really intriguing - purely minerals combination with slight wax notes and apple. Really rare and unique taste. Goes increadible well with fish. "
17155,1594682,"This wine needs food. Salted mango, lemon meringue, grapefruit, and melon nose. Medium full body. Medium high acidity. Salt, melon, kiwi, and petroleum. Complex and fun. 3.9⭐️"
17156,1594682,"A rare white colares. Bone dry, salty, almost reminiscent of a Fino. "
17157,1594682,"Nose of dry hay and a bit of lime stone. Taste is interesting combination of unripe nectarine, clay like minerals, solid acidity of rhubarb with a spanky lime kick to it. Very interesting wine!"

17161,22317,"93/100 Current release of this wine made from ungrafted vines of Baga. The yields are very low, only one bunch per vine. This is a soave, silky Baga. There are notes of mountain berries, pine, and white pepper. Full bodied but not brooding. The tannins are grippy and fine grained. It's mostly fruit now and the high acidity ensures a long life in the bottle. "
17162,22317,"Pale-medium ruby color. Cranberry, raspberry, cherry, and huckleberry nose. High tannins. Medium high acidity. Medium full body. Rich cherry, blackberry, raspberry, black currant, and earthy iron. Balanced and loads of complex flavors. 4.3⭐️  100% baga. 12.5% abv. This wine is made with its own rootstock - not on American phylloxera-resistant rootstock! "
17163,22317,"Pale ruby with a pronounced nose. Raspberry, tart cranberry, cherry, black cherry, black raspberry, smoke, tobacco and black currant. A lot going on in the nose of this wine. Dry, medium acidity, medium plus tannins, medium alcohol, and medium bodied. Medium plus flavor intensity. Grippy oak tannins, cherry, plums, black cherry, and leather. Can easily lay this one down for 10 years. Outstanding quality of wine. Medium finish. "
17164,22317,"Once again a beautiful example of the great potential of Bairrada wines, this red made again by Luis Pato ""king of Baga"" focusing on old vines, it is mature, rich and round a blend 50/50 of Baga and Touriga Nacional, a beautiful structure and complexity "
17165,22317,"The producer's dream, 20 years ago, was to create a wine that demonstrated how pre-phylloxeric wines were.  He planted vines of the Baga variety, directly, as was used in pre-phylloxera Europe, in sandy soil.  You need six vines to get one single bottle of this wine. Powerful aroma of ripe red fruits. In the mouth is fairly full, with polished tannins and excellent acidity. Very long finish. A fantastic wine. "
17166,22317,"17/20, 93/100. Black cherry, plums, blackberry, resin, oak, chocolate, black pepper. Dry, with medium alcohol, high tannins, high acidity and medium body. Very impressive. "
17167,22317,"The alluring nose feels fresh with a bouquet of tobacco- enriched plum fruit and some autumn leaves. The palate entry has an earthy / tannic concentration , vintage leather scents,mocha,saline dried cherries, smoked beef , orange rind and eucalyptus touches joining too with further aeration. Good silky mouthfeel with lovely tertiary notes and a superb balance and excellent , impressive length!   "
17168,22317,A wine with too much personality. Full bodied and very much concentrated and complex. A very special Portuguese red wine!
17169,22317,For the money I wonder when it will stop to get better and better? Baga from Luis Pato... A master....
17170,22317,Great wine by Mr. Baga (Eng. Luis Pato) Amazing
17171,22317,Exquisite. Delicate and elegant yet full of life
17172,22317,Amazing. Very complex. Fruit. Flower. Structed. Large. Final elegant acidity.
17173,22317,"Four up tonight, a great northern red, full body great taste"
17174,22317,"4,0 ⭐. Blind tasted, I wish this Baga red by iconic Luis Pato would've had time to properly decant, as it improved a lot in the glass.   Fresh crisp cassis on the nose, with hints of menthol & a ghost of medicinal herbs.  Mid body feel, super crispy rusty acidity & mature yet spiced tannins.  Crisp juicy mouthwatering palate with crisp juicy yogurt flavored cherry, strawberry, tar, medicinal herbs & stems.  Possible uprate if enjoyed in a calmer setting with more time."
17175,22317,"Surprise Portugal wine and excellent balance between sweet and dry , fantastic tannins "
17176,5643278,"Grapefruit palate, apricots on the nose. Subtle oak"
17177,5643278,Strong flavoured. Not for the faint of heart. But very well balanced for a stronger fish dish
17178,5643278,The best value white? Probably...
17179,5643278,"Like a Chardonnay / Albariño hybrid: buttery with vanilla and toasted almond, but with an undercurrent of lemon and grapefruit sorbet. "
17180,5643278,Fruity sweet and complex
17181,5643278,"2016. Quite expressive and powerful over the palate, elegance is not the term, which occurs to me but it remains fresh with pronounced buttery and pastry notes, toasted almonds, oak was overwhelming right after opening but much better integrated 1 h. Nice find, lots of personality although I miss some fruit. 3.25🌟"
17182,5643278,"I heard from a distributor that this wine could please many folks, but did not surprised nor it pleased me though. Calm nose of floral notes, properly balanced but not intense tropical and citrus palate, some pear, nice long finish. Good wine in general"
17183,5643278,"Perfect! Mature, mild and round. A grown up wine which is perfect with life."
17184,5643278,Tasted at the FNA
17185,5643278,"Dry, blackberry and tobacco on the nose. Jammy but not soft on the palate. Lots of structure but not lingering."

17189,3722798,"Red fruit. Strawberry, floral anf fresh. Very easy drinking, extremely pleasant. Light elegant tannic structure. Truly a delicious rose. "
17190,3722798,"Perfect for summer, a decent combination of floral, caramel and cherry notes make a perfect nose.  The body has a bold pale rose tone, with orange, cherry and vanilla notes. Light, fresh and medium acidity."
17191,3722798,"Peach and light coral colour. I actually have strong star anise on the nose, which is odd, but it won't go away. I hope I'm not having a stroke. Either way, drinking this with a delicious meal in Porto made the experience worthwhile. "
17192,3722798,"Cítrico, boa harmonia com frutos do mar."
17193,3722798,"N: strawberries, red currants  P: light bodied, dry, high acidity, medium minerality T: follows nose more mineral F: medium long, mineral"
17194,3722798,Relacao custo x beneficio imbativel. Excelente Rosé.
17195,3722798,"Very nice pale pink color. Peach, loads of peach, strawberry, clementine and a liiittle touch of goosberry when given a good swirl. Very nice! Nicely balanced, missing some complexety and length to be top notch. But I think its going to put a smile on your lips on a sunny day."
17196,3722798,Fruity very smooth and great to accompany our fish lunch . 
17197,3722798,"Super smooth, light but complex rose. Perfect summer wine! My current favourite! "

17203,1199470,Great surprise. Very pink but not sweet. Nice and dry crisp and tasty 
17204,1199470,Vanilla and some tannins give body to this wine. 
17205,1199470,"Blackberry, quite tannin, tobacco"
17206,1199470,"Good match with pasta, and needs a pairing as too acidic by itself."
17207,1199470,"Tasty, drinkable. I get rhubarb, dark fruit and well integrated tannins. "
17208,1199470,Very aromatic wine . Surprising flavors
17209,1199470,"Fruity, extremely good value. "

Interesting though, it is pure touring National. Usually touriga is mixed with other grapes. oak black fruit cherry plum tobacco. It is not bad, but does not bring me to my knees 🤓😛😜🤪 Cheers 😘😘😘😘"
17215,4108060,Wonderful full bodied red to be enjoyed with food or stand alone!
17216,4108060," Very reasonable and drinkable red. Medium intense nose, some cherry and spice. Palate is more impressive with cherry jam, earth, must, and dried fig. Slightly too tannic but drank young and btg, will grow into a pretty good bottle."
17217,4108060,"Bold, good mouth feel, well rounded red. Slightly tannic on the finish. Pairs well with meat or fall vegetables. Enjoyed at RIB in Lisbon, Portugal. "
17218,4108060,"Medium-full body, cherry, pepper, and earthy palate - more spicy than I anticipated, nicely complex for a three year old wine. Very good value! Will buy again. "

17225,4108060,Light and smooth. Hint of cherries. We had with beef and pork. Very drinkable and reasonably priced.  (We paid 21 euro at restaurant in Lisbon).  Nice Douro Valley red.

17239,1183111,Fris en fruitig. Like it!
17240,1183111,"A star that is a bit on the expensive side but true winemaking skills exhibited. The reserva means oak, Dark fruit and leather but also a first  easy kiss on tongue. "
17241,1183111,"As a Reserva, nothing surprising with the smell: woody notes jump at you. In the palate the blueberries take over and give this wine a smooth finish and a medium aftertaste. Good bang for the bucks"

17247,1243856,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. It has a certain very intense fruity / floral (violet?) note, something flourishing, which, in recent times, is emerging in Portuguese wines from north to south. Full-bodied, medium-dry. Still something tannin. Still young. It needs time to reveal its splendor. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Douro region. Contains sulfites. 14.° alcohol.   "
17248,1243856,"Very powerful red. Blackberry, cassis. I think it would get better, more smooth with age. "
17249,1243856,Absolute bananas good. Fucking amazing for the price point.  Let it decant and drink away.

From the nose to the aftertaste it has all characteristic what I'm expecting from wine. Deep red colour, plum, olive, spices, Coffee, floral aromas. On palate roinded, dry, rich, spicy with red fruit, leather, healthy tannins and pleasant acids. On aftertaste long lasting with taste of Coffee. One complete wine. 🍷"

The body is full, round medium+ tannins, medium acidity, beautiful complexity, predominant black currant, ripe sour cherry, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, roasted coffee. Long rough finish but nevertheless pleasant since it holds a promise that it will develop wonderfully in the bottle."

This wines starts to impress you right at the bottle presentation: an ilustration of the Douro river, one of the best Portuguese wine zones. The wine itself shows a full dark color and a great exhuberant tear - beatiful liquid. The mouth has the right density, paired vanilla and toast hints from the oak barrel. The end of mouth is super balanced and adictive! Served fresh!  Nose 4,4/5 Mouth 4,6/5 Color and Tear 4,5/5 End of Mouth 4,5/5"

17259,1243856,"Clear, deep ruby. Clean, medium intensity aroma of black cherry, currant, plum, tobacco, earth. Dry, medium acidity, medium plus tannins, full body and medium finish. Palate confirms the nose. Opens up beautifully after an hour: prune, licorice. Excellent. "

17282,1146629,"Easter Sunday lunch, great blue sky and nice temp in Portugal 🇵🇹 today.   This orange coloured Rose is freezing cold hampering my ability to get a decent nose or flavour profile however here goes.   Nose is strawberry, raspberry and orange blossom and the palate is marmalade, nutty with a bitter finish which may all change when it warms up to 0 degrees!!!!"
17283,1146629,Color is a bit darker rose.  A wine that is light enough for drinking alone but works well with food.
17284,3757562,"Region: Vinho Verde Grape Variety: 100% Avesso ABV: 13% Stopper: Cork  Medium bodied white wine. Straw yellow with green reflections in colour, on the nose, aromas of sweet pear and citrus with notes of blossom. Light tannins. High acidity. Green and flinty white wine in style.

17288,3757562,"3,85⭐Revisited, a bit better than the 2018. The aromas are pretty similar but with a slight citrus touch this time that suited it well.  Previous TN: 3,8⭐My first Avesso monovarietal. 👀Deep lemonish yellow. No tears. 👃Soft and pleasant with pear, green apple and a hint of melon. 👅Balanced, light and fresh.

17298,3757562,"Appel, peer, fris fruitig"
17299,1443588,Another fabulous 🇵🇹 white. I’m getting a little reduction (super attractive and subtle). And I’ve got a pet fly. 🪰  Possibly too rounded for shellfish…

17308,1443588,Good wine but not my favorite style. Shows an aromatic nose with interesting floral and slightly tropical fruit notes but in the palate has too high residual sugar and with its lifted aromas it reminded me of moscatel. Good winemaking but not my style
17309,1443588,"After a long hot day, this really hot the spot. Great with sea food"
17310,1443588,Fresh and smooth. Had on the rooftop in Lisbon for sunset

17314,2334566,Very young but already quite sophisticated
17315,2334566,"Nose of vanilla, apple and citrus. Tastes of melon, apple and after taste of citrus.  Bold and slightly acid. Tastes better if cold. Dark yellow. No wine tears. "
17316,2334566,"Nice white from Alentejo!  An aromatic blend of Viognier, Verdelho and Antão Vaz, vinified in new French and Hungarian oak barrels. Fruity and complex, with crisp acidity and good length. Pale yellow color, floral, peach and other yellow fruits aromas/flavors, mineral, with notes of lime, spices and an hint of vanilla.

17329,1146596,"For 🔠 E week, an Encruzado, one of my favourite Portuguese white varieties grown on just 295ha, mainly in the Dão from where it originates.  Med lemon. A heady mix of wood spice (part barrel-fermented) w. nutmeg, cassia & buttercream. Layered pineapple, white peach, white violet & orange blossom. Pretty & honeyed. Think white Burg meets Condrieu. Developing.  Dry. Rich yet fresh w. gorgeous peach, pineapple, melon, lemon sorbet & buttered pear. Light cinnamon spice w. m+ alc & a lightly toasted m+ finish."
17330,1146596,"Full of pear, “dushes” lemonade, butter with elegant orange zest nuances! Medium- body, medium acidity, bright but short taste with light bitterness! Not bad👌🏼 🇵🇹 "
17331,1146596,"Amazing wine from Dao. A bit darker yellow color, distinct pear aroma.  We had it with Pedro’s orzo with seafood and courgette "

17336,1146596,Good balance between the buttery texture and the peach flavours
17337,1146596,"light golden color. Intense  wood. Aroma. In the mouth it has high acidity and is unctuous.  Wine with a profile too marked by the wooden stage, which hides the characteristics of the variety.  Long and tasty finish."
17338,1146596,"As far as Encruzado goes – unusually clean, slightly understated, maybe because less acidity in front compared to other interpretations of this mono grape wine."
17339,1146596,"My first Encruzado white wine, from Dao. Mineral, subtle floral notes, a bit of a zest and spice. Paired well with variety of local, Portuguese, food in Madeira island. "
17340,1146596,"First try of an Encruzado from Dao. Balanced notes with hints of wood, butter and a slight metallic after taste. Elegant, slightly bitter finish. Enjoyable with fish and pork. "
17341,1146596,"My first Encruzado and it made quite an impression. Fresh, vivacious and vibrant. Ripe fruits: lemons, passion fruit, papaya, orange zest balanced with crisp acidity along its suave, creamy texture oozing with flavour personality. It reminds me of a lighter version of an excellent white Burgundy. I can understand why this is considered one of Portugal's flagship whites. The joy of discovery. "
17342,1146596,"Dão/Bairrada tasting #4/8 White wine from Dão region. 100% Encruzado, gaining popularity recently.  Partially de-stemmed. Fermented half in French oak barrels for 7 mo with twice a week batonnage & half in inox controlled at 16-18C.  Pale lemon with green hue. Ripe stone fruits of pear, peach & apple with yeasty nuance. Dry, med+ acidity, more citrus on the palate and delicate oak flavor supported by mineral backbone. Good weight. Ooh, this is my style of white!  "
17343,1146596,"Interesting varietal! Not my 1st encruzado, but this had different flavours. Floral nose, but tasting notes were of vegetal and mineral, like straw and oily. Very smooth, dry and acidic. Paired with octapus and fried chicken, went better with the fried food."
17344,1478434,"Unripe prunes, violets, petrol, hints of vanilla. Beautiful acidity that gies along with fine tannins. Medium finish with persistent oak, spices and flowers."
17345,1478434,"100% Baga wine from 80 to 120 year old vines. Very intense aroma of ripe forest fruit.  In the mouth it is complex and powerful, vegetable and spicy.  Present tannins polished by the passage in the barrels.  Intense and prolonged finish.  A great wine."

17348,1478434,Sense of ancient and strength
17349,1478434,"A ripe, powerful and brawny red, delivering concentrated grilled meat, smoke and ripe dark fruit flavors. Lots of bacon fat and chocolate notes mark the exotic finish. "
17350,1478434,A great Baga from Bairrada.
17351,1478434,Absolutely special.. nose is gorgeous with intense vanilla leading to dark fruit..  tannins are still too aggressive.. open this one in 15 years to enjoy it at its peak.. it is bloody lovely..
17352,1478434,"This Winery has one of the most special wine 100% Baga. I had the privilege to taste several vintages like 2009, 2011 and I wanted to taste again this 2010 to check the aging. Still young with enormous again potential. Great wine!!!"
17353,1478434,"Really good Portuguese Bairrada Red,  a deep opaque purple color with violet reflexes.  Nose: ripe black fruit, black cherries, black currants and red currant, plum, vanilla.  In the mouth: aromas of spices, aromatic dried herbs, oak barrels, red dark fruit, coffee.  Wine, heavy, full body, strong character tannins.  Very nice and long finish."
17354,1478434,"Baga a grape variety that makes me feel far away, earthiness, dried leaves of tobacco, red ripe fruit, nearly overripe... Not too much volume, just right on the spot of complexity, but this elegant acidity runs marathons... A bit more aging and it will be unbeatable... What a great wine!"

17357,1478434,"Violet florals, black fruits, plums cherries, smoke cloves, Chinese five spice, meaty loganberry, coffee fresh fruits and lively but has some robust tannins that need softening as a bit out of balance at the moment. I’m sure will be a delightful wine. "
17358,1478434,Hints of dark chocolate nuances and spices such as black pepper. Its freshness makes it very versatile. Must confess Im pleasantly surprised
17359,8404724,"Very mineral, light oaked  for a Rose wine, sangionese, "
17360,8404724,"Fruity, light and crisp. I will definitely buy again. "

17362,8404724,"Beautiful Sangiovese rosé! Gorgeous raspberry aromas, outstanding acidity, not a lot of depth or complexity but just a very well put together, refreshing rosé."
17363,1508612,Oak vanilla plum 
17364,1508612,"Absolutely outstanding. Oaky, fruity, everything you want - where is this unbelievable wine coming from? Big cherry notes, blackberry hidden in amongst it. Such fantastic length that keeps you wanting to come back for more. Exquisite."
17365,1508612,"Deep, dark and devious. Black Forest gâteau, tobacco, mint and liquorice shoelaces. Still so young but tannins subtle and smooth with some freshly cut cigar box. So much to like here - such value. I don’t think you would look stupid calling this a Southern Rhône.  Possible WOTN, Nuno!"
17366,1508612,Black fruits and spices aroma/dry and bitter taste.
17367,1508612,Fruit foot forward but this heavy overweight not disruptive 
17368,1508612,Delicious red. Smooth but not too much oak. Went really well with beef chilli and on its own too. 
17369,1508612,3.8/5 Good everyday red Dão blend from a rather large producer. Excellent with all kind of meat roasts. In the palate typical plumy taste that characterizes red wines from Dão

17378,1900580,Spicy wine. Taste of pepper Nice 
17379,1900580,A Douro white wine without any history.

17381,1900580,"Deep lemon-green, nose med, white peach, nectarine, pear, quince, some tropical fruits, floral, dried herbs, minerals, stone, tea leaves, vanilla and apricot. Mouth dry (some residual sugar exist), body med+, acid med+, med+ aftertaste. Very good, very tasty, with good balance and structure. "
17382,1900580,Dry and rich. Starting to get a little rainsy  but still full of delicious fruit. Spicy - cinnamon mainly. Hint of butterscotch. Great wine for food. 
17383,1900580,"Vibrant, fresh and citric "

17387,1900580,"A delicate fruity flavour, smooth till the end"
17388,1900580,"Interesting nose - wild strawberry, ocean, and kitchen cleaner. Quite light and neutral taste with some aftertaste of fish and seafood. Not the best pick of this vacation but not bad either."
17389,1900580,Very different to any white I’ve tasted. Pleasant. Sure it will go well with food 
17390,1900580,"So much wine for such a small price tag. Yellow golden colour. Melon to the nose, lots of tropical fruits, melon and citrus to the palate. Slightly sweet start with an off dry finish. Paired to perfection with our calamari and cod dish a Terra Nostra Garden Restaurant."

17392,1900580,Fruity and dry very nice !!!
17393,4075219,The proof of wonders you can do with Alvarinho grape in northeast Portugal. Very versatile with elegant minerality and soft acidity. It paired very well with Portuguese tapas. Unfiltered.
17394,4075219,"Greatly unusual wine 👌🏾 Yeasty taste The color reminds unfiltered light beer  Notes of yeast, yellow fruits yellow plum, white peach, citrus zest, minerals, gooseberry   Delightful flavor! Once you definitely have to try this wine! It doesn’t taste like anything else. Elegant and gentle.  Food: you can drink it without food. Light appetizer, salads, roasted vegetables, seafood.

17397,4075219,"Yes, also this can be vinho verde!! Straw to golden yellow, unfiltered. Floral bouquet, some tropical notes like pineapple and mango. Small hint of Licorice. On the palate again tropical, with a caramel and nutty touch. Mineral finish. full bodied with floral notes. "
17398,4075219,"Holy shit! Is this vinho verde? Incredible juice. Unfiltered indeed greenish. So concentrated it is an excellent match to the spicy ice horns of coquilles and avocado and then the pizza slice of foie gras, grapes and the best pecorino ever. "
17399,4075219,Great wine to have with friends and love ones with a different and natural young grapes  pineapple citrus apple pear lime minerals
17400,4075219,"Tasting with the wine maker Nr 2 - apple, pear, citrus.  Our favourite white from Soalheiro. Paired surprisingly well with cheese "

17402,4075219,"This wine is natural, unfiltered and unfined. Visual is cloudy with slight golden hues. No translucence. Pear, green apple, slight funk, and citrus on the nose. Medium to medium plus acidity, slightly lower than most green wine. Pear, apple, and melon body finishing off with some tart lemon. A fun find. "
17403,4075219,"Golden and hazy, just dry and quite rounded, melon, grass and herbs and minerals. Vanishes unbelievably quickly. "
17404,4075219,Delicious dried apricots on the nose. Syrupy honeyed apricot to follow. Crisp enough to cut through.

17406,4075219,Pairing: pizza  Winesday!!
17407,4075219,apple citrus pineapple 
17408,1758888,"Chablis!  That comes to mind first. Clean, fresh, dry, vivid, minerally, good intensity and long finish More towards lime than lemon but a clean stainless steel style that I only know from Chablis, Germany and Austria but absolutely not from Daõ, Portugal.  Excellent company for gruyere, onion and smoked bacon tarte flambee Under €9 this is good stuff. Very curious to taste the Encruzado from this quality house."
17409,1758888,Great white for a reasonable price
17410,1758888,"Lovely peachy aroma. Citrus on the tongue, crispy with a little bit of sweetness. White wine is not my forte, but this one is nice."
17411,1758888,"Golden colour. Nose of yellow apple, ripe pear, lime, white flowers. Some salty minerality on the palate, integrated acidity and a dry finish. It developed a bit after opening, and there is some lees-like here too. High alcohol for a white at 13%. Good, clean Portuguese wine here!"
17412,1758888,"Backlog from Winefest in Fredrikstad. No time for notes, unfortunately."
17413,1758888,Butter in the nose. Dry fruit on the tounge. High complexity. 
17414,1758888,Easy drinking fruit on nose and palat but does not liger. Easy drinking enjoy with all foods including cheeses
17415,1758888,"Full bodied wine, grew on me more over time"
17416,1758888,Quite fruity notes in a solid white. Good price/quality ratio

17421,1758888,"Acid, fruity wine"
17422,1758888,Complex full body wine on lees. No oak used. Best for food paring. Shamelessly overpriced at Fallon&Byrne (Dublin) at 35 eur 
17423,1257837,Good bang for the buck. Bold dry and easy drinking 
17424,1257837,"Juicy, jammy, notes of dried blueberry, dried fig, and dark cherry. This is a very typical entry-level Duoro red wine."
17425,1257837,"If your question is what's the best everyday Douro I can buy, this one is the answer! Lovely, no frills, medium yet silky tannins, loads of dark fruit, fig and a tiny touch of oak. Low alcohol, medium to thin bodied, with medium legs with wonderful tastes. "
17426,1257837,"Good wine paired w/ pasta ""negri"" w/ seafood and pork (another dish). Cheers!"
17427,1257837,"Deep ruby in color. The nose has violets and other flowery aspects, almost a bubble gum note. Fruity on the palate but a bolder mouthfeel than other Douro reds I've had recently. Good length on the finish, with almost faint sweet flavors. "
17428,1257837,"Plummy, juicy, touch of wood, easy drinking."
17429,1257837,"Rich, rough and ready - welcome freebie from my Lisbon hotel. I’m not looking this gift horse in the mouth. The drunken porty fruit belies its relatively tame 13.5ABVs."
17430,1257837,"Violet,  cherry red fruit"
17431,1257837,"It delivers what expected, mature and well developed flavs great to slowly bbqed hogrev."
17432,1257837,"Plummy, with a touch of dark berries and a hint of oak. Moderate tannins with a puckery finish. Good with a steak or burger; looking forward to trying it with pasta and sausage with a rich tomato sauce."
17433,1257837,Rich Dark forest berry taste and a beautiful dark scarlet colour.
17434,1257837,Good price quality ratio. Tannins and frut al over it! Slightly dry.
17435,1257837,"Fresco,  sobressaem as frutas vermelhas. "
17436,1257837,Dark red-bluish colour with lots of dark red fruit. Well-balanced with hints of chocolat and vanilla at the finish. Nice value for the money but that is all.
17437,1257837,"Vinha da Urze comes from semi desertic Douro Superior, with poor soils, huge difference of temperature between day and night. The wine is more complex that you could expect at this price level, with red and dark berries flavors intertwined with spice and light oaky flavors. Great affordable Douro wine!"
17438,4656452,"Still Ripe and fruity. Hints of plum, red apple, orange peel and cinnamon. "
17439,4656452,"What a port! Full body, fruity, not too sweet, dried berries, candies and a kong finish. Great when cold on a hot summer day!"
17440,4656452,"(4.1) ‘Full and ripe  Porto wine. Figs, raisins, sweet dark cherries, cacoa, abricot, walnuts and alcohol warms you up after a shopping day in Leiden.’  "
17441,4656452,"[Crasto tasting - full range] #13  Great way to end the Crasto tasting after 11 wines, 2 ports.  This Colheita 1998 is a top port especially the nutty taste is very nice!   Fine palate with different layers: different fruits (plum, raisin, fig, ripe blackberries), the typical nuts  (almond, walnut) added with chocolate, a creamy touch, sweetness blanced with acidity.  Enjoyed every sip of it!  Rate 4,1⭐️  Overall conclusion of Crasto: to follow further and store some bottles in your cellar! Great Quinta! "
17442,4656452,"[Crasto tasting] Solid vintage port with cookies, beautiful red fruit, raisins, enough acidity and a long finish. 4.0"
17443,4656452,"Nice, balanced and elegant. "
17444,4656452,Very complex and beautifully aged. Good balance of fruit and oxidated notes
17445,4656452,"Cherry pie with spices, walnut. High tingly alcohol."
17446,4656452,"Disappointing: tastes young and inharmonious, like the wood and fruit never got properly acquainted. Deep purple color, cloying sweetness."
17447,4656452,"Yummy!! Great wine. Dense, rich, full of exotic spiciness, cinamon, apricots, dense and almost impenetrable but this powerful first impact shows a great deal of caracther and deliciousness. Rich, round and a tremendous long lasting finish. One of the best young colheitas I can recall tasting recently"
17448,4656452,"Complex, well spiced port with notes of apricot, cinnamon et al. The experience lingers on. Port at its best. "
17449,4656452,"Excellent tawny porto with intense and elegant aromas of caramel, dried figs, vanilla, cedar, toffee, licorice and cigar box. Very pleasant pleasant acidity, balanced and very long aftertaste "
17450,4656452,93 great wine at its peak. Powerful and generous. RP 92
17451,4656452,Excellent Colheita Port! 
17452,4656452,A great port. Soft and balanced with super flavours. 
17453,1424778,Deep dark cherry  red colour. Cherries on the nose too. Velvety on the tongue and brings forth blackberries and dark cherries. Smooth and voluptuous. Reminds me of Kelly Brook 😜
17454,1424778,"ntense purple red color with violet rim reflections. Notes of ripe black fruit, tobacco leaves, cigar box and spices. Well structured with firm tannins, full bodied, balanced, good acidity and medium long finish."
17455,1424778,"Slightly spice, oaky and black fruitiness on the nose with med + intensity. Very appealing on the nose. Full body, med+ acid and very refined tannins: weak at first and building up a pleasant sandiness was around the teeth after a few seconds. Finish is ok with med, although finished flavours are quite mixed and vague.  All in all enjoyable. Could have wished for longer and more intense finish. "
17456,1424778,"Wow, what a bottle. Decanted for an hour and it opened up beautifully. So much on the nose. BlackBerry fig plum oak tobacco vanilla such a nice whirlwind of flavours. Bold with good tannins and a long gripping finish. Man I love Portugal 🇵🇹 🤙🍷"
17457,1424778,"Deep red color. Scent of sweet ripe dark fruit supplemented by flower notes typical of Douro wines. Rich taste with an earthy touch and a little oak. Tannins are present, but have a delicate structure. An elegant, harmonious and still youthful wine. 🍷🍷"
17458,1424778,"Dense, fresh and with complex aftertastes  accompanied with my girlfriend is making the Sunday evening nice."
17459,1424778,From Duero with love. Feines Aroma. Die Touriga Trauben machen Spass.
17460,1424778,"Nice, full body, Excellent ratio value/price "
17461,1424778,"Nice. Rich taste with blackberry,  tobacco and cherry on the palate. Needs air. Lovely smooth tannins. Dry and well balanced. Very good qpr."
17462,1424778,Very nice wine but takes some time to open up (above 15 mins) and then guess well with meat. 
17463,1424778,Dark full bodied  Duoro red smooth dry balanced finish
17464,1424778,"Lot of potential, still young! Very good rpc."
17465,1424778,"Dark, inkish... Dill and cucumber brine to gouache and ripe cherries"
17466,1424778,"Tbd. Balanced and elegant, with acidity like a soft chianti, but still not distinctive or memorable. Nice peppery finish. Ok value."
17467,1424778,Excellent balance and full. Red fruit tones and even tannins. Full wine with good tannins. 
17468,6685569,"intense aroma to tropical fruits, with some dry vegetable. In the mouth, it presents great balance between alcohol and acidity. It has a slight bitter touch, characteristic of the caste. Average and very nice end. Very gastronomic wine, with excellent relation quality price"

17473,6685569,Classy and fresh single grap which is also impressive given the conditions
17474,6685569,"Interesting, nose red grapefruit, palate as well, rising up to nose from mouth. High acidity, soft on mouth."
17475,1214770,"Pricey but fab little wine. Dry, with oaky notes and blackberries. Loving it!"
17476,1214770,"Good value, dry, full-bodied. The alcohol dominates, even in the aftertaste. Should âge a few more years, it’s a bit young to drink. Highly recommend decanting before drinking. Beautiful ruby colour, with notes of prune. Definitely pair with a wild red meat dish. "
17477,1214770,"Very tasty wine. On the nose I get pepper, oak, and dark stone fruit. Very smooth wine with medium to medium low tannins. A dry fruit forward wine."
17478,1214770,Less powerful than I expected - slightly underwhelming for price
17479,1214770,"Sky high price, bought it for my B-day and expected much more. 4 stars only because i can't give less, but i really expected 5 stars."
17480,1214770,"Dark red wine. Intense nose with black fruits, blackberry, black pepper, vanilla, dark chocolate, cedar wood, graphite. Balanced acidity, high smooth tannins, full body, spicy, long finale. Powerbroker. "
17481,1214770,"Old vines, 12 months in wood. A rich, structured and firm wine. Concentrated tannins and big black fruits. "

17485,1214770,Good wine but not amazing
17486,1214770,"Aged for 12 months in new oak barrel, it shows smooth tannins and immense complexity on the palate. Very good wine!"
17487,1214770,"88-89/100, 3,8+* Nose of medium intensity with forest berries, wild strawberry, bilberry, blackberry, cranberry, herbs, almond, coca-cola, oak, forest floor, balsamic.

17488,1214770,"And next fine blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca from Douro region. Very rich aromas of black fruit mixed mostly with vanilla and chocolate.  🍇 80% Touriga Nacional and 20% Touriga Franca   👁 dark red colour in the glass  👃 incredible palette of dark fruit of plum and BlackBerry mixed with chocolate and vanilla. Also supported by some pepper mint licorice cinnamon bay leaf   👅 full bodied wine with medium acidity, soft tannins and pleasant vanilla finish  Tasted during Warsaw wine fest. VG!!! "
17489,1214770,"First impression is taste of wood everywhere.After a while the wine opens and you can taste the black fruit, all the blackberries and some kind of spices. Very balanced with a good body. This one requires to be opened at least 1-2 hours before drinking."
17490,1981379,A northern Portugal red wine described by our Sommelier as similar to a Pinot Noir. I think it is a touch heavier but very drinkable.
17491,1981379,"89 pts  Really looked forward to this after the wonderful white and if you like a big nose this has it is spades, very powerful intense concentrated ripe fruit, plums, prunes, cherry. The palate might not be jammy but its right next door. Flabby is living the other side and is just held off by enough structure. The balance would benefit from a little more tannin and acid. Thoroughly enjoyable as long as you are in the mood for a whack from a fruit hammer.r"
17492,1981379,Should have waited few more years before try it. Not as full bodied as Douro wines but full of character and a taste of oak and berries!
17493,1981379,"Baga, old vines, 18 months in 700l barrels. Winemaker Anselmo Mendes. Fruity, slightly toasted. Plum, ripe cherry and a bit of blackberry repeated notes of aroma. Fresh, juicy, with sandy tannins and light bitterness at the end. Not an impressive, but good."
17494,1981379,"Deep rich and fabulous.  The Baga grape variety is difficult, normally needs time to please, this wine is an exception after 3 years it is not only drinkable but what an enjoyment, spices and dark red fruit and a long amazing finished!!"
17495,1981379,Did pairing with cheese: a stronger cheess enhance the black currant and iron while a creamier cheese enhance tones of almond. Full bodied with quite high tanines. According to the waiter its a grape only grown in Portugal.

17508,1612909,What a value!!
17509,1612909,"A cuvee of 4 grapes, well balanced, smooth tanins, with flavour of berries."
17510,1612909,"A wine of Douro on notes of ripe red berries, spices, with a wooded touch well integrated. Softened mouth, fruity, with one finale slightly spiced (clove, black pepper). Perfect to accompany an improvised barbecue. Thank you Cédric Dufrasne  Un vin du Douro sur des notes de fruits rouges bien murs, d'épices, avec un boisé bien intégrés. Bouche velouté, fruitée, avec une finale légèrement épicée (girofle, poivre noir). Parfait pour accompagner un BBQ improvisé. Merci Cédric Dufrasne"
17511,1612909,"BA lounge JFK. Smooth and silky plummy nose with currants and berry jam. Soft tannins, vines and hints of cocoa, flavorful. Rating is actually a 3.3 "
17512,1612909,"Another good wine from Douro.  A bit of bottle age helps round this off.  Dark coloured, nose of spice and Victoria plums. Fruity and delivers lots of pleasure."
17513,1612909,"This is a high quality red from the famed Douro Valley. Full-bodied, deep with a bit of pepper, dark cherry and easy lingering finish. An excellent example of the high quality, value-prices wines you find in Portugal. "
17514,1612909,"I generally stay away from blends but this one hit the spot paired with sautéed mushrooms in soy sauce and a miso-glazed cod with a group of 4. To that effect, it is fairly imposing and a little drier than I expected initially, but the palate balances out and becomes much silkier as the wine opens. I bought it at $13, and feel that this was a very good value wine. "
17515,1612909,4-4.5 rating. Tasted in 2016 WineStyle at Botanical Winter Wine Market. $22-24 AUD.
17516,1612909,Black fruits and very ‘mineral’. 
17517,1612909,"Very smooth. Had this in Porto, Portugal "
17518,1612909,"Really nice Douro. Rich, pretty full bodied red, with lots of berry fruitiness and a little smokiness. "
17519,1612909,"Fruity, good, light"
17520,1612878,"Light greenish yellow colour. Citrus, lime and peach on the nose. Balanced on the palate with fresh acidity. Medium finish with notes of tropical fruits"
17521,1612878,"Blackberry,  pinewoods, great oak barrel. A hint of strawberry   Light on the tongue and allows the food at atmosphere to breathe"
17522,1612878,"I don't quite understand the red wine reviews in the list...  Golden colour.  Very ""green"" nose of Bell pepper, spring onion, green pepper. the longer it's open the sweeter the smell becomes.  The palate adds some sweet fruits like peach and some herbal notes of rosemary and licorice wood.  It has a very soft and velvety texture for a white wine. And has a wonderful level of complexity.   This is a very nice wine to drink on its own because of the nuances in taste. But I imagine it just as well with food."
17523,1612878,"Blackcurrant and plum. Tobacco and coffee. Vanilla (oakiness).  Mint. Tannic. Well structured. Long finish, good aftertaste.  Very good wine from Portugal (regional alentejano). "
17524,1612878,A complex and balanced white.
17525,1612878,"Aroma of ripe black fruit, wood notes and hints of spice. The palate follows the nose, with big and firm tannins, medium acidity, and a long and elegant finish."
17526,1612878,"Plummy, easy drinking, little Woody "
17527,1612878,started off dry and edgy but soon showed a nice smooth complexity
17528,1612878,"Very pleasent in the nose, aromatic with fresh fruits sorrounded by balsamic notes smoke and spices. Good body and structure with strong tannins and a long finish. Better than a lot of expensive wines"
17529,1612878,"Black, purple color. Fruit bomb in the nose. Mainly blackberry. Lots of fruit also on the palette and noticeable tannins combined with a depth and Fruity sweet makes this a noticeable wine. Very long finish. May improve further over time."
17530,1612878,"Excellent full bodied red blend from Portugal.  Syrah, Alicante boushet, cab sauv. Gift from traveling children.  Solid Cab like feel with blackberry nose and dark cherry richness.  Lovely wine.  Can't wait to taste the reserve brought home now in storage."
17531,1612878,"im not entirely sure about the nose,  but i sense green pepper, bell pepper, it smells like what one would expect from an aged wine  oily appearence, intense yellow with grenish notes  tastewise, I detect more fruity aromas than I would have expected accompanied by herbal notes,....very cgarming on the palate...with closed eyes i could possibly take that for a red wine"
17532,1612878,"Remember Lilt (with the totally tropical taste)? Well, not that. But a rush of tropical fruits nonetheless: mango, pineapple, melon. It’s just that Lilt doesn’t really have the tarragon and salty finish. Great glugger and goes like salt and vinegar with your fish (scarlet prawns and golden bream on this occasion).   Yikes! Rating #1964 - year of my birth!"
17533,1612878,"Lots of tanins, wonderful blackberry color!"
17534,1612878,"Dark fruit, violets, bit of jam, very intense, long. A great wine"
17535,8519255,"Amazing.  Beautiful colour. Nose of pencil shavings and spice. Silky smooth palate full of dark cherries, blackberry and a hint of nutmeg.  Delightful. "
17536,8519255,"I’m getting more and more impressed with Taboadella. This one,  for Portuguese conditions, relatively high altitude of 500 m, w loads of granite and silt in a magnum bottle. Unbelievably nice fine and Dusty tannins. If we ever going to find a contender/ alternative expression to Hermitage/Syrah it will be in Dão and the grape Jaen."
17537,8519255,"Soft silky dark berries in aromas with terroir expressed, tannins and new oak.  Flavours are quite earthy, once again a new forest sensation with delicate tannins, dry damson. The length is mellow with a silky cocoa taste sensation.  It's a fine and elegant wine. Sit back, relax and admire the wine."
17538,8519255,"Spicy cassis dark berries aroma, a bit vinous and light. Blackberries cassis in front, light yet lots of flavor and tannins. Fruity and silky smooth with a touch of some sweetness. Minerals, stony. Good juicy dry finish. Good pairing with a lamb roast Provencale."
17539,8519255,"Tried together with the Alfrocheiro from the same plots. Smooth and lighter body, present tannins. Notes of oak and vanilla. Paired with roasted piglet"
17540,8519255,"Silky texture with cassis and black cherries, wet stone and hints of herbaceousness, fresh with a bit of tartness to it still, will integrate more with time."

Very fruity and spicy with lots of black berries, chocolate, earth notes.  🍇 Jaen 100 %.

17543,8519255,"Love it! Though it is the typical Portuguese wine, with all its dark berry, leathery, tobacco flavours it is way more accessible than the upper class Douros, that would need 10 years of aging. Seems to me that the Dao is more like my cup of wine. The opposite goes for whites btw. "

17548,8519255,"Price wrong obviously but what a little find. Soft tannins and big fruit, what’s not to like but with food I suggest. "
17549,8519255,"Complex aromas, still very young. I want to drink it in 10 years time, should be huge."
17550,5834258,"Wow, an absolute bombastic wine. Accessible straight from opening. Deep purple colour in the glass and the wine clings to the sides. Tannins are there but not aggressive for a 2019. aromatics are a little oppressed. Going to try this over 2 days to see how it opens up."
17551,5834258,"Definitely my first, my last my everything 😱🥰🥰🥰🥰 Ok, so far but also so true 🙌🏼 Totally dark, intense, full-bodied: awesome ❤️"
17552,5834258,Full bodied wine. Great to meat
17553,5834258,"Pretty nice wine. Needs to breath. Oak, plum and floral notes in a complex wine."
17554,5834258,"excellent wine from the Sousão grape variety. Intense dark red color. dense, clings to the glass. black fruit aroma. in the mouth it is creamy prevailing the notes to spices. Long end"
17555,5834258,"I can taste the slopes of the Douro valley. Intense deep purple colour, smells of cherry, licorice and forest floor. High acidity gives it citrus tastes."
17556,5834258,Different grape very pleasant after it opened up but at first a little off putting in the nose.  
17557,5834258,"Consistently amazing. Although a bit more acidic than previous years and more alcoholic, it is still very satisfying. "
17558,5834258,"Wow is the right response to this beauty from Douro. Despite its young age, it is built to be enjoyed now with very soft tannins and mild acidity. The complexion is dark ink. The nose an exciting mix of spice and caramel. The palate fruit, chestnut and a faint hint of nutmeg and licorice with chocolate on the long and satisfying finish."
17559,5834258,"Sousaõ from 100 Hectares, Duoro.   Beautiful big oaky nose of pickle spices such as dill and vinegar essence accompanied by caramel, damp forest floor and black fruit. Unique and complex on nose.   The palate is well balanced, beautifully layered, and in line with the nose with some additional nutmeg. The finish is long, dry and powerful showing a subtle underlying herbaceousness. Wonderful and unique. 4.3."
17560,5834258,"Wow wow wow ........ what a wine.  If you like big, bold, full flavour reds then this is for you.  A young wine but drinks like a classic.  Huge bold nose with great hints of black fruits and cherries.   The taste does not disappoint, smooth with good tannins that delivers everything the nose promised.   Full dark fruits with a hint of spice and pepper.  This wine will blow you away...."
17561,5834258,"The aroma of black fruit, raspberry, nutmeg, sweet spices and caramel. Deep wine, with fine tannins and perfect acidity"
17562,5834258,"Young and super strong. A jar full of blueberry, licorice. A powerful violet color and a loooong aftertaste. "

17565,2263573,The fresh crispness of alvarinho in combination with a complex saffron undertone - divine!
17566,2263573,"Very good Alvarinho,  from Vinho Verde, a pale straw color with silver reflexes.  Nose: sweet citrus, with white floral accents.  In the mouth: sweet citrus, bright fruit, ripe pear, yellow apple, green grass, herbs and spices, pepper, a lot of mineral nuance.  Elegant wine, full, rich, fresh some bitter notes in aftertaste."
17567,2263573,"This wine was made from 40 year old vines, which makes it more mineral than its “younger brother”, less fruity, but still great to drink on every occasion. "
17568,2263573,Really nice white with beautiful notes of minerals and green apple

17573,2263573,Could drink it all night
17574,2263573,"Kind of hate it to start with, came to accept it towards half bottle and ended up liking it at the end. Was almost drunk by then so I don't think it counts. Overall uninspired alvarinho."

17581,1278774,Very good wine.
17582,1278774,"Nice, rich full bodied wine, drink now"
17583,1278774,One of the softest Douro Tintos I have had. 
17584,1278774,"Full body ,  plum prune jam oak"
17585,1278774,"I would like to give it a five stars rating but now I am a little bit mean! It is a well produced wine, with lots of body and long lasting after tastes. It is already round and very drinkable!"
17586,1278774,Real Douro juice. Fresh and ready to use. I knew Kopke as a Port producer but this was a nice surprise
17587,1278774,"Quite powerful. Port-like notes with warm fruit, herbs and spices. Heavy on the tannins. Good balance and nice to drink"
17588,1278774,"Wouldn't have guessed it would be light and graceful in the glass (still a deep, brooding color in the center, despite the lighter rim). Rich, ripe fruit but not ripe in the overly sweet sense. More as if it were picked on the ideal day. Firm but soft tannins that give way to a dancing, echoing finish. 4.7 conservatively. "
17589,1278774,"Very balanced and smooth with a well-pronounced character and, at the same time, less alcoholic. Remarks made on 2015 vintage and already looking forward to tasting 2016 that I have just received. "
17590,1278774,Delicate and subtle
17591,1278774,"A treat - yes; fruity red (dark) berries, spice, shiraz'y scents; but oversll: port wine flavours!!! Absolutely awesome - chasing port droplets. Not a new favourite, but a great acquaintance."
17592,1278774,Outstanding. A vine you can eat
17593,1278774,"Wine tasting @ new douro  Dried berries (and even prunes) on the nose  Berries and vanilla palate, very easy drinking"
17594,1278774,"Very nice douro wine, full body nice tannins. So it's very smooth"
17595,1405926,De belles notes de fruits noirs!
17596,1405926,"Lovely light, fruity ruby port"
17597,1405926,"A very solid vintage Port, this is a bit on the sweet side but with nice tannic vertebrae.  Nice in front of a brisk autumn campfire!"
17598,1405926,"Wonderful complex dark fruit flavours, coupled with an amazing and long finish. This port is not overly sweet and is a perfect accompaniment to living :)"
17599,1405926,Best port wine I have tasted
17600,1405926,"Nice depth, full port, yet fruity, wihout being too sweat"
17601,1405926,"It is now good, but not impressive. It has some interesting notes in tannins, but it should be kept for some time. Now it is not the best."
17602,1405926,Unique port - not sweet
17603,1405926,"Tasted at the winery.Thick and rich with beautiful inky color. Viscous with flavors of dried prune, figs, dried plums. Long long long balanced finish. Would drink this again and again. "
17604,1405926,"Deep ruby red and opaque color with classical aroma of ripe and intense black fruit, notes of chocolate and pepper. In the mouth, it’s full-bodied, persistent and lively acidity with a vigorous tannins. High ageing potential in the bottle is predictable for a several years with the wine acquiring a character of its own."
17605,1405926,"Very very young, but still enjoyable when paired with something like a strong cheese. Wouldn't really choose it to sit and sip though. Deep purple colour, lots of fruit, not overly sweet, massive mouth drying tannins. Not 100% sure you're better off with this than a decent LBV if you're drinking it today, but feels like there's upside if you hang on to it"
17606,1405926,"Fruity, not overly sweet."
17607,1405926,"Young, lively Ruby port. Rich plum aromas. Dark cherries and hoisin sauce. Sticky figs, and plum liqour like Riga Balsam. Nice acidity. Slight bitter tease. Not too sweet and a good match with Rice pudding with strawberry Sauce. I still prefer the Niepoort LBV I had some days ago. "
17608,1405926,"Finally a vintage Port! 🍷♥️👌🏻 One of the great things about wine is that no matter how much you've tried there is always a first time, like today with this vintage Port.  The right sweetness of red fruit and black fruit, fig and dried fig, plum, prune, blackberry, jam. long lasting wine  4.2☆+"
17609,1405926,"Nice affordable Ruby Port. Good body, bitter notes. Great with blue cheese or Bethlehem pastry."

17617,1240368,One of nice wine  we have tried in Porto. Easy drinking to go with both seafood and meat 
17618,1240368,Great balance and weight. Nice combination of geeky but approachable. Really enjoyable and probably could have gotten more interesting with a other 2-3 years in the bottle. Very nice.

17620,1240368,"15.75. A very definite wiff of Port to this wine. Lovely elegance, soft and finessed. Very long finish but a tad simple. Concentrated red fruits though lean a very juicy aspect. Summer wine?"
17621,1240368,"Really enjoyed this, picked up at the market in Porto and opened once we arrived in the Douro. Smooth, fruity and very drinkable. Great value. "

17628,2631043,Soft/elegant yet long in mouth.  Good legs
17629,2631043,"Fresh nose with vanilla, stonefruit, pleasant fizz. Simple and classy with a mineral finish. Pleasant wine. "
17630,2631043,Railway carriage again pretty good not outstanding
17631,2631043,"Summer 2020 Peso da Régua,  Aneto restaurant. Very unusual white. Alvarinho,  verdelho and Encruzado 🍇 grapes. Nose is 🍎 🍏 apple like sidre. "
17632,2631043,Vanilla floral fresh beautiful wine highly recommended 
17633,2631043,"Revisiting the Aneto, triple local grapes, but not as amazed as before, a little thin around the waist that even slightly disturbing vanilla note on the nose - still a good wine but I have to retract my 4.5 from November🙄"
17634,2631043,"Nice, dry and robust wine. Like their reds more, but it’s a good white! Notes of oak, cucumber, butter and citrus."
17635,2631043,"Never tried this grape combination before. Light butter, lime, weirdly enough some garlic, but it works very well. Opened up after half an hour with more grapefruit and more butter."
17636,2631043,"This is a white wine, not sure why so many people have reviewed this as a red? Golden in colour, aromas of sunflowers and apricots. Some tropical fruit notes for flavour with a fresh acidity. Semi dry finish with some lingering notes of lychee. Was nice!"
17637,2631043,"Fancy wine! Just the way that I fuck love! A lot tertiary flavor such as chocolate and caramel... BTW, nothing with ANETO disappoint out! 😜 cheers!"
17638,2631043,This was very fresh and light perfect with taco salad. But of course you expect that at €36 
17639,2631043,Wow!  Love this rose...
17640,5138538,Amazing white wine! It remembers a Pera Manca Branco (white). Highly recommended.
17641,5138538,Don’t remember drinking a white wine with this complexity. Lovely dry flavour that is fabulous with cheese. With my eyes closed don’t think I would believe that was a white
17642,5138538,Woody nice but acidic in the end

17650,1172847,"Dark purpur in colour. Cherries, blackberries, dates, leather, smoke, black currants, and vanilla in the aroma. Flavour of vanilla, cane sugar, leather, cherries, toasted nuts, and honey. 88."
17651,1172847,"Very young vintage port, needs years to develop in the cellar, and the present rating reflects its immaturity.  First impressions are liquirice notes. Behind this theres a plesant mix of raisins and dark berries. In the mouth its syrup like in texture with the same notes as on the nose.  Its just not there yet, but the potential is!"
17652,1172847,Classic vintage port that taste very young despite being almost 20 years old. Very intense fruit and plenty of tannins. Good value. 
17653,1172847,"Dark red with purple hints. Fruity and intense, ripe fruits, raspberries, plums als spiceness. In mouth very complex, sweet, concentrated wine with long finish "
17654,1172847,"Color is deep, almost black. The nose is young, a bit medical and firm. The taste is dense, strong, balanced and with great promise. It is good now, but will improve in the coming 10-15 years. But nice to drink now!"
17655,1172847,"Dark red fruit, wood and hay. Very good.  Dark red fruit on the palate with notes of cherry, plum, wood, vanilla, figs and spices. Really dark and deep. Notable tannin. Very fresh & vibrant. Can be stored years more. 93"
17656,1172847,"Deep ruby color, intense, expressive and elegant notes of ripe black fruit like blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and lovely aromas of eucalyptus and menthol mixed with tobacco leaves, dried herbs, fig, prunes, vanilla and cigar box. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. Balanced, vibrant acidity and long luxurious finish."
17657,1172847,"Soft, deep red and sweet with a nice initial alcohol hint which turns into sweet dark fruit (plum and raisin), caramel and a bit of vanilla. The Old Pharmacy wine bar in Lisbon’s barrio alta area seemed like a perfect place to taste this"

17664,1265625,"Deep but translucent ruby with big consistent teary legs. Blackcurrant, blackberry essence, crushed pink peppercorns with a whiff of baked spices and a miny touch. Dry, juicy and medium- bodied with a pleasant freshness on the finish. "

17675,1265625,"Mixed feelings about this 2013 Touriga Nacional from Pedra Cancela. Perhaps this was a lesser vintage, or maybe not my style of wine. Dark ruby color, and a pleasant enough nose with plenty of blackberry and some pepper notes. On the palate I found it less enjoyable with a one-dimensional fullness and tight - and it didn’t really improve with air. Decent finish. Better Portuguese wines to be found in the same price range.   "
17676,1265625,"100% TN. Fermentou em lagares de granito e estagiou em barrica. Aroma muito elegante a fruta bem madura, com notas florais. Em boca é equilibrado, aveludado, ligeiramente amargo, mas muito frutado. Bem agradável!...  100% Touriga Nacional. Fermented in granite 'lagares' and aged in casks. Very elegant aroma, ripe fruit and floral hints. In the palate is well balanced, velvety, slightly bitter but full of fruit. Nice wine!...  "

17751,4989151,At the Wines of Portugal annual tasting with @[1|4684559|Janne W.]
17752,4989151,As the name says.. Quartz is the soil that the wine was planted on.  Mineral driven and well balanced. The wine was only 6months in steeltanks and therefor is pretty fresh. The additional year in the bottle made it quiet round and gave the wine a good drinking flow.  Medium body with a integrated acidity.  Mire floral than fruity and with a mineral underlining.  Did fit perfectly wirh our seabass tartare. 
17753,4989151,"A serious wine for the price. Less aromatic and floral on the nose than the standard Beyra branco, this wine is more mineral and complex while at the same time being weightier both in texture and flavour. Quite broad in the mouth but with a piquant, salty, mineral finish. I wouldn’t chill this wine too much and think probably it would benefit from some ageing. Overall very good. "
17754,4590431,"Lovely Vinho Verde, perfect summer wine either for chill drinking or to pair with some snacks, easy-going, citrus flavors, mineral, medium-plus acidity."

17758,4590431,"Saw that this had sneaked into an El Corte Inglés Monção & Melgaço promotion and thought it might be more interesting than all those Alvarinhos :-) (indeed the label describes Avesso as 'one of the most original Portuguese grapes'). As it turns out, I'm not convinced: indistinct aroma of citrus, stone fruit, some fragrance, a pencil-lead undertone perhaps, followed by a hard/tart/bitter taste of lemon and grapefruit that's not especially enjoyable. Wouldn't repeat. (13% abv) (paid €8.15->€6.99)."
17759,4590431,"Atypical vinho verde, but very nice. High viscosity, but not overly sweet. Light on the minerality, with some peach overtones. "

17761,4590431,"If you know what to expect then you’ll be pleasantly surprised - Portuguese wines are dry and oak free, perfect with tapas - this wine is dry with lemon and citrus (no oak) - solid contender"
17762,4590431,I'd never had Avesso before. If it's usually this good I'll have it again. Terrific yellow grapefruit and white Peach goodness. Actually drinkable on its own because it isn't too tart. But perfect with scallops. 
17763,4590431,"Wonderful Portuguese light wine. The aroma of grapefruit, citrus. Very fresh"
17764,4590431,"Food friendly Vinho Verde, bit more body than you would expect and very good minerality. First wine from pairing at restaurant ‘t Lansink "

Finish is medium and the wine is very good "
17768,4590431,"This wine jumped out at me.  To the point that I drank it several weeks ago and still think about it. Ergo, I'm belatedly rating it.  Here's what I do remember, it was stony and crisp without being austere. There was bracing citrus (lemon and lime) and it went perfect with a shrimp scampi. I will definitely be getting another bottle to unpack it more!"
17769,1179446,"Field blend. Old vines. Fermented in oak. Clear, pale gold. Clean, medium plus intensity aroma of pear, peach, pineapple, honeysuckle, garrigue, wet stone. Dry, high acidity, full body and long finish. Palate confirms the nose. Outstanding quality. "

Nose with pineapple, lima. 12,2 degrees only but very intense and focus gripping the palate. The wood is very present and well integrated, very dry and mineral, almonds, medium high acidity, elegant, long and deep finish. Still very young. I think it would be better to keep older. "

It is aromatic, and some sweet aromas. Taste is very acidity, even sour. Very fresh. Lots of citric tastes, lime and green lemons, some vegetal tastes, like grass, and esparagus. Some toast as well.

17809,1949292,Had better and cheaper! First time I tried Tinto Cão single.
17810,1949292,"Curiosities/Rarities #13: Tinto Cão - 'Tinto Dog'. A late-ripening variety whose yields - the Wines of Portugal website says - are so low as to be economically unviable, meaning ""it is possibly therefore destined to die out"". Which, judging by this find, would be a real pity. Perfumed aromas (red/black fruit, citrus rind, rose, barrel, smoke, wet earth). Natural balance on the palate, with finesse from elevation (600m) and character from age (6yrs). Tasting peppery yet smooth and silky. (13.5% abv)."

17843,1169273,A great example of terroir where its environment pleasantly impacts the wine.  The warmer temps and higher altitudes produce that concentrated flavor. This is a joy to drink. 
17844,1169273,"Saudade: (n.) melancholic nostalgia and longing for a dear person, place or thing that is far away from you. This a nice gift from our visit to Portugal. Fruity and full-body.

17861,2282316,"Hi altitude, quite noticeable integrate minerality and of course organic ;-) & 6 months Sur-lie- unfortunately the Viognier sticks out and makes for a unnecessarily flowery finish."
17862,2282316,"The grapes are typically used for vinho verde but the douro terroir and the blend with rabitago makes it a bit more complex. I fancy the complex aromas, the buttery mouth while I find the smoky aftertaste less pleasant. I would’t recommend it for the apero, more as a great pairing with spicy african fishes"
17863,2282316,Very aromatic. Good wood work. Notes of peach.

Citric, smoky, granitic, very mineral. High acidity, medium body, great complexity and persistancy.  A good experience indeed."
17869,2282316,"Intense and fresh aroma, demonstrating the cool summer nights at altitude 575 mts in the Douro Superior, marked by violets, black and red fruits characteristic for Touriga Nacional, Jaen and Sousão in balance with notes of French barrel (15 months maturation)."
17870,2282316,"Fruity, fresh and with a special flavor "
17871,9020265,Very good wine . A must have 
17872,9020265,Due to high work load here’s a batch of ratings-only wines - texts will resume ASAP 😅🤓
17873,3093996,So young but so much potential. A beautiful Dão. Still closed but already pleasant.  Elegant and fresh. Great acidity and fruitiness.  Another great wine by Nuno do Ó! 
17874,3093996,"First impression is dry/cold pineapple. It’s a grape I’m very fond of. Nice balance of acidity. Introduced to me by Joel at Terroir Portugal in Funchal, Maderia. "
17875,3093996,Really interesting wine 
17876,3093996,"Fully bodied wine, a hint of sweet, wood and butter taste. Strong after taste of aromas"
17877,3093996,"Bold with a nose of physalis, a hint of yellow paprika, elegant body and nice freshness. Passepartout for meat and fish. "
17878,3093996,Great nose with black fruit oak and cherries. For a Dão really elegant because it is cultivated at 500 m altitude. Great wine! 
17879,3093996,"Nice and powerful red assemblage from Portugal.  This is maybe the last red to try in a series, hard to follow up. Maybe too bold for some (but not in a bad “jammy“ way).  No detailed TN."
17880,3093996,One of the best reds I've tasted in a long time. Tinta PINHEIRO grape is not so used but was very well inserted in this blend.
17881,3093996,What an unusual finding. Very old vines do not sure exactly which varieties and in what percentage. For sure Jaen (Mencia) and Touriga Nacional but possibly some more. Elegant but powerful 
17882,3093996,"Elegance from Dão, although I prefer their white"
17883,3093996,"Encruzado - one og Portugal's absolutely top white grape varieties. Restricted very much to the DOC Dao. It is used both as a singel variety and as a star ingrediens in many Dao blends.   My Greatest catch during my private litle Portugal Wine trip.   Jancis Robinson; "" Useful, nobel white wine speciality of Dao."".  Great citrus notes and intensely mineral notes in this Wine. The acid is impeccable.  A Beautiful Wine.  "
17884,3093996,Tobacco predominant strong lovely nose. Medium full but tannins not too strong. Round feel with dark berry.
17885,3093996,Another champion from Dão region!
17886,3093996,"Ultra dry, herbaceous and bitter. Strong leather character "
17887,3093996,Tends to 3.8 but not over 4 
17888,1974062,Special portuguese wine with a lot of grapes. Different spices as well! 
17889,1974062,Rich blend of several grapes from Portugal. Smooth and enjoyable wine.
17890,1974062,"This is a Portuguese red wine from the Dao region. Interesting mix of grapes Alfrocheiro, Jaen, Tinta Roriz, Touriga Nacional. On eye: deep purple color. On nose: medium intense, but funny and interesting: menthol, chocolate, red and black fruits. On mouth: same as on nose. Interesting menthol, chocolate and combination of fruits. This would be 4+ wine, with the structure it has, only to have a strong intensity. Very nice structure, but a somewhat pernicious intensity. My grade is stable 3,5 ⭐️ (3,6)"
17891,1974062,"I’m a sucker for Gouveia grape. Well balanced, not too pricy. Had it with some stuffed meat and sting flavors and it hold its ground very well. Serve chilled, too sweet for my taste."
17892,1974062,"Smoked cherries,  depth, floral, textured tannins "
17893,1974062,"Quite a good value here, maybe more of a 3.75/5. Notes of dark fruit (blackberry and dark ripe cherry), savoury spice, just a tad of earthiness, and some eucalyptus at the end. Rich, full tannins, medium and balanced acid. I don't know why but I wasn't expecting much and was quite impressed, I will be looking for another bottle."
17894,1974062,"Joint manual harvest of the 4 varieties ( Alfrocheiro, Tourigo Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Jaen) , fermentation in stainless steel vats and aged for 12 months in used French oak barrels. Aromatically intense with flavors of stewed blackberries, baker’s chocolate, woodsmoke and mentholated prune fruit. On the palate with a smooth and elegant attack, displaying hearty dark raspberries, eucalyptus and undertones of unsmoked cigar and licorice root. Finishes las and with lots of freshness!"
17895,1974062,"Not accustomed to paying $20 for Portuguese wines? This one could alter that.  Dark fruit nose and a big bold wine jumping right out, uh oh, another sweet jammy number?  Nope, juicy black fruit tastes, oak, chocolate and pepper with a nice acidity/tannin balance.  And very dry at 3 g/L sugar but drinks smoothly.  A variety of notes appear from the blend of the popular Touriga Nacional plus Alfacheiro, Tinto Roriz and Joen grapes, breathing really assists.  Pair it with Portuguese fish stew.  ABV 13.8%."
17896,1974062,"A: Quite intense aroma of vanilla, cedar, thyme, blackberries and morels. Promising! T: Rich in tannins, medium+ acidity. A bit too plain taste of leather, oak and blackberry. Aftertaste is ok, but too short and too plain. Was better to food. 89p"
17897,1974062,"Bonus half-star for value. At 20 bucks, this 2012 Portuguese tinto blend punches above its weight.   Immediately exciting nose ripe with violet and lilac, Swedish berries and smoke.   Super juicy and fruit forward, with ripe blackberry and raspberry complimented by cardboard box and convenience store must, feeling beauj-adjacent for sure.   More than anything, definitively yummy. "
17898,1974062,"Alphabet Day - 🅳  🅳ão 🅳OC. The 🅳ao is one of the oldest wine regions in Portugal, south of 🅳ouro Valley and home of TN 🍇. The region is mountainous with sand on granite. This wine grown on banks of Rio Mondego.  Blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfocheiro and Jaen.   Deep garnet/crimson. Nose is meaty, earthy, deep red & black fruit. Dry, med/full body, med+ acid, light tannins. Flavours of aged black cherry, plum and blackberry, savoury meat notes, toasted oak, smoke and tobacco. QPR. 3.9🏍😎"
17899,1974062,Value galore. Deep red color. Peppermint on the nose and also aftertaste. Medium tannins. Slightly spicy. Very bold and complex. V good
17900,1974062,"Chocolate, plums on nose, Fullbodied  wine with nice tannins. Mineral, wetstone on palate combined with quite sour fruitiness, which soon turns sweet. Interesting wine"
17901,1974062,Heavier than I expected 
17902,1974062,"Dry, fairly tasty and very well suited to balance a nice little blend of steak, onions, spicy souce and Jerusalem artichoke (jordskokk) - form a very likable pairing!  Too much to go alone - need a food pairing!"
17903,1925611,"(4.2) Lovely Alantejo Syrah/Alicante Bouschet, 12 months on oak + bottle aged.  Fresh and tannic dry approach. A bit creamy and spicy on the palate, full bodied with flavours of cherry, blackberry and green herbs.  Persistent throughout, brings some acidity at the end."
17904,1925611,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. Full-bodied, medium-dry. Still young. However, in the sensorial dimension it's already a pleasant wine from the Alentejo region. Contains sulfites. 14.° alcohol!   "
17905,1925611,"🇵🇹 Maravilhoso tinto, Herdade do Sobroso, veste granada escuro, aroma fruta vermelha e preta madura, groselha e ameixa, notas balsâmicas, especiadas e baunilha, paladar encorpado, aveludado, amadeirado, taninos finos e acidez viva, final longo e delicioso.  🇬🇧 Wonderful red, Herdade do Sobroso, wears dark garnet, aroma of ripe red and black fruit, currant and plum, balsamic, spicy and vanilla notes, full-bodied, velvety, woody palate, fine tannins and lively acidity, long and delicious finish."
17906,1925611,"3.9 - fruit forward and spicy Syrah blend from Sobroso. Got this as a tryout sample and will order a case of every day wine.  🍷 old world Syrah glass 👁 intense dark ruby 👃 clear tones of vanilla 🍦 and dark fruit; blackberries and plum 👄 a bit unbalanced at first but after an hour of air it settled. Nice structure and even acidity. Long fruit driven finish. Spicy notes for sure, pepper, cassis.  ⏰ still young, could evolve in cellar but could enjoy today if decanter. Drink now >>> 2029"
17907,1925611,Balanced to perfection!
17908,1925611,"Oak, vanilla, red fruit, cherry, berry on the nose. Very Mellow, pleasant wine, blackberry and mulberry with a nice acidity and medium long finish. "
17909,1925611,A very concentrated wine of Syrah and Alicante Bouschet blend this 2018 Sobroso Cellar Selection. Red forest berry jam and a hint of chocolate. This one would be better with a few more years under its belt. The tannins give good structure but need to settle down a bit. For this reason alone I gave a 4 star but I am sure in a few years this wine will deserve much more. Saúde!
17910,1925611,"Full bodied, good balance. Best PT wine in a long time. 😊"
17911,1925611,"Dark and will improve with age, burned character with tones of liquorice, plums and blackberries. Intense palate with good fruit and fresh tannins."
17912,1925611,As minhas castas favoritas do alentejo
17913,1925611,"Deep ruby colour with dark rim. Complex nose with pronounced aromas of ripe blackcurrants, blackberries, blueberry, prunes, herbaceous, dried herbs, vanilla, pepper, chocolate, coffee and oak. Dry with full-bodied and rounded well integrated tannins. In the mouth explodes aromas of ripe black fruits and licorice. Structured, textured, good acidity, balanced with very long and overwhelming finish."
17914,1925611,"Good wine, showing very ripened fruit, clearly from a very hot and dry year. Although the fruit first impact shows itself to be fresh and very pleasant, the mid palate presents a lack of acidity that turns what could be a tremendous wine into a very single dimensional one. Good but not great. The correct temperature of service is crucial. "
17915,1925611,Intense color with balanced acidity. Paulo loved it
17916,1925611,4.8 another outstanding wine from antelejo tried it at an event in London and I have to say this wine ruined my palate for a good 10 minutes  It's bouquet it's just superb with beautiful scented notes of berries and spices Full bodied with aggressive tannins towards the finish but smooth and velvety mouth feel Notes of ripe red summer fruits and autumns dark fruits with hints of oak like clove and nutmeg finishing very long and drying out your palate
17917,1925611,brighter fruit notes with fragrant and spice notes. Color is a lighter red than I expected. Needs about 10-15 minutes to open up. 
17918,1208656,"4,2 - the groups #2 and my #3 this was a nice well structured mature wine that delivered fruit with elegance "
17919,1208656,A wine to be remembered.  Very well balanced and really tasty
17920,1208656,"Sharp color, on nose Dark wild fruits, fresh notes, tasting very interesting with full body and long end."
17921,1208656,"Had this wine again after about a year and it really is very nice. It requires a lot of air to get to its full potential but then has a full robust body with soft tannins and dark plum, oak, nuts and a lasting finish. However given its high price, I must say that for half of this money you can find something even better, for that reason I'm not going above a 4 star for this."
17922,1208656,"Deep ruby red colour with garnet rim. Complex nose with pronounced aromas of ripe blackcurrants, blackberries, herbaceous, vanilla and oak. Dry with full-bodied and rounded well integrated tannins. In the mouth explodes aromas of ripe black fruits and licorice. Very long and overwhelming finish."
17923,1208656,Full body wine and prolonged finished
17924,1208656,"Very good... Price quality!!! Not to fruity, not to dry, not to floral!!! Goes well with meat, fish and tapas!!!"
17925,1208656,A clear straw white from Alentejo with resin and lychee notes. A floral palate with good al balance but not really a long wine.
17926,1208656,That's the Best Portuguese i've ever tasted.
17927,1208656,"""Gold 21K"" color a bit lighter than previews wine, fruity aromas and palate ends up with little hint of lemon"
17928,1208656,Ruby color. Spicy and fruity aroma. Intense in the mouth. Good tannins and acidity. Long finish. A Classic Alentejo wine!
17929,1208656,Very bold and we like it
17930,1208656,Beautiful alentejano. Despite the age is still powerful and full. A classic of the region.
17931,1208656,"Top grade Alentejano with spices and red pepper (took that from the label) but first and foremost, lots of ladder saddle and horse sweat. Wonderful wine that, unfortunately, was ridiculously badly decanted."
17932,3920595,3.9 very unique on the nose compared to a unique taste profile. This would be a great steak pairing wine or something to quiz guests on what it is.
17933,3920595,"After one sip of this one you’d want to take a second straight away. And then a third. It’s light, refreshing and beautifully balanced. Great value. Cherry, raspberry - and also chocolate and caramel on the palate. Just a bit of forest floor. "
17934,3920595,"A very unique and different wine from the Dão, very light and very balanced. Notes of blackberries and cherry, slightly chocolate. Smooth tanins and green tones in the mouth. Very good for the price."
17935,3920595,Solid.  Very good value.
17936,3920595,"Ok. Dark fruits, good acidity and a robust finish."
17937,3920595,Good value for an uncompromising wine. 
17938,3920595,"A  mild spicy and intense aroma. Light bodied, a strong presence, a bit bitter with a hint of oak at the end and a wonderful aftertaste."
17939,3920595,"A Dao I like! I’m usually not a fan of toasty oak, but here it works. Cherry cough-syrupy fruit, with cinnamon, on both the nose & taste. Led by jaen (i.e. mencia, which makes sense & likely why I like it), along with alfochiero & others. Toasty oak on the nose & finish. Its best feature. The mid-palate is strong enough to stand up to the oak. A fruity finish on the edge of residual sugar (which helps explain all the body). Could go a few more years. I liked it & tried to rebuy. 4.0 woofs is correct."
17940,3920595,"Excellent wine from Dão. With red fruit, smoke and oak aromas, medium in tannins, dry but smooth in end. Well balanced! "
17941,3920595,Leather and red fruit aroma. Taste-wise fresh and on the dryer side with notes of cherry and leather. 
17942,3920595,"Elegance that is rarely found so young in the DÃO. Very good and drinkable... Great wine, loved it!"
17943,3920595,Cherry red fruit lovely with Spicy food
17944,3920595,"Medium bodied, perfumed, low acid, lavender and incense"
17945,3920595,Light agreeable red from Dão!!
17946,3920595,Nice price value Portugal surprise 
17947,1296892,Fantastic!!! Marcio’s chose this to pair with our prawns... excellent choice and such a privilege to profit from Marcio’s wealth of experience throughout this amazing dinner before lockdown. 
17948,1296892,"Fruity, with distinced mineral flavour and a lovely after taste. Very unique flavor! "
17949,1296892,"Unusual, unexpected and unique. Colour of straw reflects Campolargo's strict terroir approach. This is like no other white I’ve had. Taste of flambée prunes or even brandy or calvados hints. Really exotic and a winner. Saúde!"
17950,1296892,"A bit of milk and coffee on the nose, very eloquent palate, slightly occidated already. Spreads evenly and immediately over the entire palate. Short finish."
17951,1296892,Prova Cave Lusa Wines and Spirits 2016
17952,1296892,"Temperature is critical to let this wine shine. Great complex and balanced nose, raising interest in the wine, but short on the palate although the impression improves with the perfect temperature. Interesting wine and already 5 years old..."
17953,1296892,Woody but elegant.
17954,1296892,Buttery af. Could have been colder. I felt hasty. 
17955,1296892,"medium bodied,with a nice evolution and buttery touch"
17956,1296892,"Good aromatic profile, clean stone fruit and a very good floral and spicy hint. Great finish"
17957,1397486,Excellent!  Rose and berries in nose.  Some nice bitterness in mouth. Excellent acidity. Nice finish.
17958,1397486,Full bodied. Spicy fruit. Good concentration and a long fruity finnish
17959,1397486,"Still a little disappointed here, but perhaps I shouldn't be - still not a patch on the '08 - but it's a full, rich, round wine, full of flavours - a certain light touch to it - edgy - nice finish - there is a certain deliciousness starting to appear - perhaps it just needs some more time? 4 hour decant. 100% Petit Verdot. 13%"
17960,1397486,Good value for money 
17961,1397486,I wish I could ship this to warsaw
17962,1397486,First time trying the perdit verdot grape. Long and elegant finish. Surprised.
17963,1397486,"Very fruity and warm scent, cherries and black currant, earthy and warm fruity taste w long aftertaste"
17964,1397486,One of the Bairrada's finest. TOP #winelover
17965,1397486,"Sober, with a woody and slightly toasted aroma, it is dry, persistent, spicy, with good balance and slightly highlighted tannins. This varietal with the Petit Verdot variety vaguely resembles Calda Bordaleza Red from the same Campolargo winery, also in Bairrada, but with less body and complexity."
17966,1397486,Good fruits and overall balance.
17967,1397486,"Dark fruit, coffee, high acidity, round tanins. A good wine, well made"
17968,1397486,Soft friendly wine with lovely honey tones!

17991,1946126,"Tasted at Feira do Vinho do Dão in Nelas. A very good wine. Slightly old style in its rusticity and in all the good aspects of it. Lots of caracther and identity. 3,5-4,0 but takes the highest score for its very good value. Fresh profile and stony granitic caracther."

18025,2028967,"An opulent organic, high concept Duoro white.  It is delicate and bright, with fresh acidity and stony minerality.

18033,2028967,"I have been less than impressed with the entry level wines of the much renowned siblings Joan and Antonio Maçanita. As I understand it, they believe that the winemaker has equal or bigger importance than the terroir. This wine w great choice of grapes and vinification from Duro is no exception. All this work and we still get a tropical fruit yeast with a marshmallow tone impregnating the journey. We will now try the monogrape top numbers and see what difference there is.

Present, yet integrated acidity and a smooth and slightly polished texture.  If someone is new to redwine than this would be my new choice to start with. Not kitchy or plain.. just easy going.

She used the existing vineyards from the grapevine breeding operations established by her father to produce her own wines and systematically extended the vineyards as part of a targeted expansion programme.   Today, Dorina and her two daughters, Luísa and Julia, enthusiastically advocate Portuguese wines.  This very awarded Montemor Touriga Nacional is a monster with 15,5% alcohol and incredible tipicity"

18102,1434108,"A true heavyweight wine, even the empty bottle weighs in at 1.2kg! The wine matches the bottle, rich and full bodied, a spectacular wine. Took off half a point because at €64 it should be a special wine. Bought at the winery after a fabulous tasting with Bruno. "
18103,1434108,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. It has a certain very intense fruity / floral (violet?) note, something flourishing, which, in recent times, is emerging in Portuguese wines from north to south. Full-bodied, medium-dry. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine. Contains sulfites. Alcohol in the level 15.°, which, for me, is too much for table wine and a less gastronomic aspect."
18104,1434108,Amazing wine. Full bodied with dark chocolate notes. Definitely grape and red berries aftertaste. 
18105,1434108,"92/100 Made from 100% Alicante Bouschet, foot trodden in lagares and aged two years in the barrel. This is refined, serious stuff. Notes of rubber, tobacco, cedar, black cherry, plum, and pepper. This is full but not brooding because of the acidity. Alcohol is balanced and there is a spike of fruit intensity. Round tannins and a long finish. "
18106,1434108,"Southern Portuguese Red, made 100% of Alicante Bouschet and one of the best I've ever tasted from this grape variety. Bottle no. 0654 of 3031. 15% Vol. Aromas of blackberries, ripe plums and wood. Taste confirms the nose. Ripe dark fruit and spicy at the end. Dry with smooth tannins and balanced acidity. Long after taste Still very young. High ageing potential."
18107,1434108,"World Wine Experience 2017 - Rio de Janeiro. Rubi com tons purpura.  Aromas frutas maduras, balsamico, especiarias. Seco, acidez media para alta, encorpado, taninos medios para altos.

18110,1434108,"Another sentational Alentejo red! Only made in exceptional years, this powerful Alicante Bouschet  is a bold, complex and very concentrated red, with a beautifully balanced structure and great length. Deep violet color, floral, ripe dark fruit/berries with notes of dark chocolate, spices, resin, an hint of vanilla and very well integrated oak. Full bodied, polished lively tannins and amazing long finish. Outstanding red,  good to drink now but with great aging potential (if one can resist waiting)!!!"

18117,2774081,"4.3 - Slowly matured in new French oak barrels for 1 yr, the wine shows a dark ruby color and a rich, wild fruit aroma with mint and spices. The flavour is intense and round, with silky tannins and a persistent finish."

Blackberry, leather, black cherry, cocoa nib dark chocolate, boysenberry, and violet. Alicante Bouchet is one of the very few grapes with colored flesh (red juice immediately upon pressing, does not need skin contact for color). Good wine - nice balancing. Neutral oak use gives nice chocolate note but not overdone  50% Alicante Bouschet, 20% PV, 10% Syrah, 10% Touriga Nacional"
18122,2774081,"Purple/dark Crimson coloured red, on the nose you get Plum, blackberry, mint, leather, oak. On the palate it’s a bold and full bodied wine, with 14.5% very much felt, medium tannins. Some disconnect between the fruit and the tannins that leaves a bit of a gap on structure and balance. "
18123,2774081,"One more time an amazing wine.  Raspberry or strawberry yaourt, grenadine, spices, menthol. Juicy, great acidic structure at the beginning then the fruits/tannins wave phase comes up and leads to a very long finish. "
18124,2774081,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. Full-bodied, medium-dry. Still young. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Alentejo region. Contains sulfites. 14,5.° alcohol!!   "

18132,1736466,"🇵🇹 Aromatic nose, very fruity and intense. Lots of black fruit, including blackberry, blueberry, plum, black cherry. This wine is a bit acidic, dry, and quite complex."

18137,1736466,"A generous young Douro offers a powerful bouquet of black fruits and oak, showcasing cassis, ripe blackberry, black currant leaves, vanilla, cedar, licorice, cinnamon, black pepper, earth, dried sage, and hints of roasted meat. High acidity, ripe tannins with concentrated fruitiness, more restrained on the palate but the nose can tell its great potential. Leave it in the cellar for 2-3 yrs."
18138,1736466,"Initially this was much more savoury/herbal than fruity (though there is dark, quite tannic fruit) with old leather, vegetal notes (clean rather than off putting) and slightly stale tobacco. Later a bit more black cherry and blueberry came through. I drank this on its own; I suspect it would really come into its own with food. One to look out for @[1|14312528|Duncan Scott]!"
18139,1736466,"Inky dark purple. Lovely aroma of dark fruit, blueberries, plums, a touch of chocolate and balsamic and incense notes. Smooth and acidic hit on the palate, with vanilla and dark fruit notes. Lingering finish."
18140,1736466,"Deep ruby color.  High intensity blackberries and dark berries aromas, secondary wood, chocolate and almonds hints. Dry and medium acidity level. High intensity tannins, full bodied wine.  Intense blackberries flavors with secondary wood and vanilla touches.  Can age for several years in the bottle what will allow its tannins to mature and soften. Open at least 30 minutes before enjoying it. "
18141,1736466,"I wish I could give this 3.75. I bit too much tannins and acidity for me, although the sweetness is just right. Great blackberry flavor. The wine definitely did improve with time out of the bottle.   I would buy this again when it’s on sale; however, I don’t find it exceptional. "
18142,1736466,"Elegant, aromatic and fairly complex. Dark purple color. Medium finish. Very interesting wine from Portugal..."

18145,1736466,A fairly light Douro red with low tanin and a fruity edge that lasts a while. There are better tasting wines that I prefer at the same price level. Interesting but not one we enjoyed enough to buy more.

18164,1449871,A beautiful white wine from the south of Portugal.
18165,1449871,"La Grande Dégustation de Montréal! My parents actually visited the domaine last year and it is apparently breathtaking!  Peach, butter, saline, pear and lemon all around. Long finish. Very good."
18166,1449871,"Coming back to this great white from Alentejo!  An aromatic blend of Arinto, Viognier, Chardonnay and Alvarinho, aged 9m in French oak barrels. Concentrated and complex, with great acidity and length. Yellow color, mineral, citrus and tropical fruits aroma/flavors, floral, with notes of fruit jams and an hint of vanilla/ oak. Dry and creamy, with a fresh lingering finish. Excellent white, with good value and great aging potential! "
18167,1449871,"Rich, white honey, red spice, yet somehow green. It’s a wonderful mix and much better if you drink 30-60 mins after its escape from the fridge. Needs air to display its wares. “Don’t wear a mask, same reason as I don’t wear underwear: gotta let things breathe”. 🤣 (I’m wearing a mask btw)."
18168,1449871,Elegant white from Alentejo. Well used oak balanced by sufficient acidity. One could take it for premier cru Burgundy.

18174,1449871,"Enjoyed today during a Portuguese taste off across the miles with @[1|21994377|- Dan -], @[1|7459024|Scottoz] & @[1|6272997|Wineman Steve]. Pleasant without being particularly inspiring at lunchtime, general citrus notes. Opened up nicely this evening with a decant - lemon persists, some pith there with crushed almonds & oxy hints. As much about the texture as the flavour. Scored this 4.5🌟 3 years ago and thought I might have overscored - 3 years later, it's certainly punching at that weight. Great stuff."
18175,1449871,"(4.3) Super elegant premium Alantejo blend, gently oaked 9 months, 13.5% alc.  Creamy and powerful approach Viogner - Arinto - Chardonnay driven. Most significant element is minerals with notes of pine resin and granite stone. The fruity part comes with ripen citrus and starfruit.  Full bodied and persintent wine, almost never ending, just with a twist of acidity. "

18210,1262662,"Tabac, fruits noirs, well balance "
18211,1262662,"Very elegant, dry not Ver expressive, lightly citric and lightly white peppery. Well made and with good 2-3 year potential. Well balanced"
18212,1262662,A good everyday wine from Portugal. Shows a lot of red fruit mostly and bit vanilla. Not so much complexity but for drink it at the pool or in a hot day is a good one.
18213,1262662,"Soft, but with good length. Fresh grass on the nose, bit of plums on the palate. Bit peppery, slight citrus."
18214,1262662,Very good with goat cheese
18215,1262662,"This is Portugal red wine from Alentejano region. On eye: deep ruby color. On nose: nice fruit but medium intensity. I like it, but i would like more stronger intensity. On mouth: very elegant wine with fine tanins. Very nice balanced acidity (medium minus). On end nice wine with lower intensity in every aspect. Grade is barely 3,5 ⭐️ (3,4)."
18216,1262662,"Blend of Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouschet this is an inexpensive dry red with earthly notes, leather, graphite but short finish."
18217,1262662,"A bottle we gave some time to let the little reductive whiff dissolve. Afterwards there’s plenty of raspberries, cherries and perhaps a little blueberry... On the palate it’s the fresh approach in combination with the fruit that stands out. The modest use of oak has just a supporting function. Nice wine. Feminine. Perhaps a little aggressive touch from the acidity and a little short but for 9,50€, this is well done!"
18218,1262662,"Bold and full bodied wine. Dry, med tannins, mug oak, savory and a lasting finish with a subtle sourness. Powerful "
18219,1262662,"Aroma: Lush red fruit, elegant, fresh, satiny and with good complexity. Palate: Persistent flavor and juicy."

18222,1828934,Love a vinho verde in Portugal. This one isn’t as lightly sparkling as others I have tried. But it is still very crisp and refreshing. Perfect on hot summer evenings. 
18223,1828934,"Perfect, fantastic balanced between fruit and body!!!"
18224,1828934,"Really nice vino verde. Light bubble, fresh and acidic but well balanced. Saline, lime and honey!"
18225,1828934,"Nice fresh Vino Verde, brings all the characteristics with it. Citrus, light sparkle on the tongue and freshness."
18226,1828934,"Loved it. Really dry to the point of a hint of bitterness. Green apples, lime, minerals, honey"

18241,1796405,"Softening with age now, very tannic"
18242,1796405,A to me unknown Portuguese wine that’s really impressive at this price. Well balanced and lovely dark fruit. Tasted at Wine Trends Fair in Stockholm.
18243,1796405,"Alcohol bomb, no character or depth."
18244,1796405,"Fruity, bits of plum. Like a juicy merlot.  Slight spiciness afterwards. "
18245,1796405,"Lovely. Dark colour, just a tinge of discol6 around the edges of the glass. Full bouquet vaguely medicinal but in a good way - like a peaty whiskey. Well rounded bold not too tannic and a long warm finiah"
18246,1796405,"Wauw, my kind! "
18247,1796405,Excellent! Strong spicy and nice!
18248,1796405,"If your first smell makes you smile, you know you have a good bottle. Here:  nose shows cassis, black fruits, cedar. In the mouth complexity of fruits, vanilla, very dense. Tannins, roundness from the alcohol which is 14,5% abv but I bet it is a touch higher. Nonetheless, the smile remains. Will get better with a few years"
18249,1796405,"(3.75) Blend of Alicante Bouschet and Touringa National (60-40%). 12 months in oak barrels. Quite rich and still fresh and fruity nose with ripe red berries, plums, mint and spices.

18264,4398985,"(3.9) ‘This Portuguese red dog doesn’t bite but is a gentle and friendly companion, although with an earthy and rustic character. Dark fruit, dried figs, vanilla, soft dark spices and garden shed. Very likable and cuddly.’  🛠14%Alc 🍇💯%Alentejo 🛒Winetasting"
18265,4398985,"The ""Red Dog"" - Tinto Cào is very elegant on the nose. One can imagine that the wine maker has a lot of experience. The taste was in the beginning a bit harsh but once the wine was open for a while it was a complete difference. If you want to surprise your guests - try this one "
18266,4398985,"Dry, tastes like red fruits"
18267,4398985,"Very nice red one. On the nose dark red fruits, vanilla and waxy toast. Full bodied and complex with dark fruits, vanilla and herbs. Nice long aftertaste"
18268,4398985,"Belting bottle. Starts with some lovely vanilla and Floral notes on the nose. Then some amazing sour cherry and sweet strawberry. Finished with that bourbony edge and just stays on your tongue for an age. Absolutely beautiful, just what I had hoped for this bottle. "
18269,4398985,Interesting and quite full bodied. Quite black fruit forward with savoury notes. A bit of sour cherry and something green on the palate. 
18270,4398985,"It smells strongly of spicy red fruits and violets. On the palate, these aromas present again with strong tannins, balanced acidity and a long, elegant finish."
18271,4398985,One of a kind. This single Tinto Cao grape has lots of structure. Although seems very young and quite tannic it will improve greatly if you let it breath. It has really a strange and unique taste. But did conquer me. Aroma interesting and grows on mouth taste.
18272,4398985,"Portugese wines are different. They are very good, worth trying, but they are best to be enjoyed after 10-15 years. (Or at least decanted for 1hour plus). It is a great wine with fruits and spices mix, mushrooms and quite enjoyable aftertaste. Good job."
18273,4398985,Soft and sour
18274,4398985,Intriguing red made with an unusual Portuguese grape. Really good
18275,4398985,"Excellent Portuguese wine but need to be decanted, very powerful. "
18276,4398985,Animal farm nose. Very original indeed. 
18277,4398985,Good but expected more 
18278,4398985,Unusual wine with floral aromas. Refined and complex but the 2013 is young even in 2017 so may need a decade to mature fully. Overall a floral nose and smooth finish. Not the big finish expected at this price point. The finish is quite long and lingers on the tase buds. This wine is a bit of an enigma - not stunning but overtly refined and a sophisticated tipple. Maybe decanting for a few hours more would really open it up.
18279,1832943,"Bright and fruity. Medium purple color. Aromas of plum, blueberry, and cherry. Flavors of blueberry, blackberry bramble, and plum, with medium tannins and bright acidity. Long finish. "
18280,1832943,"4.5⭐️ for this Portuguese Dão  🇵🇹 red wine. 👁 Clear visual with a dark ruby color. 👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry with ripe fruits and a second sniff focused on cherry, plum, chocolate, mushroom, vanilla, some smoke and oak. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of ripe fruits. Good persistence in the mouth with long finish. Elegance red with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🍷"
18281,1832943,"Very aromatic wine, predominating smoky notes. In the mouth is complex and fruty. Ling finish. Great value for the price"

18286,1832943,"Tannic, acid wine which took a very long time to open up. Strong vanilla, plums and tobacco. Could use a few years in the cave."
18287,1832943,Very nice and floral. Great Fruity smell. Dark fruits on the palate and a lasting taste
18288,1832943,"Be careful not to mix this wine with its little brother - a whole lot cheaper but also not as good. Does not need a lot of breathing time, and yet maintains its taste and longevity a long time after opening.  Soft (not agressive of sandy on the tinge) and yet lasting taste.  Preferred with pork filet mignon, and (surprisingly) quite pleasant with chocolate cake."
18289,1832943,Rich earthy jammy!
18290,1832943,Very nice & unbelievably good value. In Portugal. 
18291,1832943,Love it tastes and feels big.

18293,1149939,Full bodied but not heavy. Opens up as you drink it 
18294,1149939,"One of those very dark, oaky,complex wines of the douro. Needs to breathe to reveal its pearl"
18295,1149939,"Always happy to find this kind of surprise a top wine crafted from old vines as field blend traditional from the Douro, an intense and complex red - 18 months in French barrel part new part used"
18296,1149939,"Quality to value a plus plus, bold aromas & flavours "
18297,1149939,"Absolutely fantastic, smoky blackberry and tobacco. Great elegant body! "
18298,1149939,"I bought this wine with Andrea Biaggi at Mercovino Ribeirão Preto. Deep intense red colour. Nose of dark red fruits with subtile spicy herbs. In mouth despite its 10 uears it presented itself fresh and vigorous with medium body, rounded up tanins, and fine flavours. Ended up with personality and persistance leaving a pleasant and prolonged fruity aftertaste. A typicall Douro to have handy when it that uncontrolable desire to eat codfish appears! Cheers!"
18299,1149939,"Trophy from Douro! Blend of 7+ grapes in FR oak. This bottle (1 out of 4045) born almost on the same day with my son 18y ago.   L: muddy dark ruby, classy stripes, still purple rims at abv.13%. Developing N: black currant, dark cherry centering with anise, licorice, forest floor intensely floating around. Blows of etheric oils, tar.   Bold but elegant P: vivid acidity, ripe tannins-full bodied, still fruit forward-amazingly perfect shape!  Mouth covering, rowan dry mid-way. Licorice, mint, peat finale. 4,3."

18303,1149939,"Right up our street, full nose of red fruits, great body, nice tannins, lasting finish. Can't deny it's heritage in the port wine region."
18304,1149939,Smoky blackberry and tobacco notes. Needs breathing
18305,1149939,"Vinho robusto, amoras e mirtilos. Prolongado."
18306,1149939,"not as good as the previous vintage, but probably will evolve into it. Dark color with the scent of red fruits, mainly blackberry. The tannins are a bit hard yet, but you already feel a very long end.. to drink it again in 5 years..."
18307,1149939,"Criminally under rated based on my experience and a steal at what I payed for it! Very aromatic, slightly animalic nose with sweet, ripe prune and black fruit followed by a palate with more prune, tart, enjoyable acidity and perfect tannines. There is quite some sweetness that absolutely doesn’t bother as it is so constructive. There’s also a lot of power and long finish with vanilla and a bitter edge. Nice age, also for the vines (80 years) practically promises a good time! 4.3"

18321,1171568,Light and smooth. Didn’t taste much of aftertaste though.
18322,1171568,"A very good wine that would benefit from a slightly fuller body. Medium ruby. In the nose, medium intensity with cherry, strawberry, blueberry, coconut, violet, tobacco, smoke. On the palate, medium intensity with cherry, blueberry, blackberry, coconut, smoke, graphite. Medium body, high alcohol, bone-dry, medium acidity, medium-plus tannins. Excellent pairing to pasta with parmesan and beef.  "

18327,1368603,"Unfiltered LBV, 2014 is the latest release.  Fruity and generous, this is another good port from Ramos Pinto. Classic in style, and rather elegant. Bright fruit, violet and spice play against richer notes of tar, chocolate and liquorice. Lovely balance of weight and flavour. Would be interested to try this with a few years extra bottle age; unfiltered LBVs can improve in bottle like a mini vintage port. 3.5*+. "
18328,1368603,"Chocolate,  vanilla,  black cherry and plum aroma's.  Quite soft on the palate.  Good acidity and concentration.  Lovely, elegant Port wine which will please a lot of people,  including me 😋."
18329,1368603,"Significant step up on the reserve ruby. Deep ruby colour, pronounced aromas of ripe blackcurrant, blackberries, blueberries, violet, cinnamon, cassis and raisins with medicinal character. Sweet, high acidity, high tannins (ripe, fine-grained), high alc, full bodied with pronounced flavours of well-defined black fruits and spice, cassis, raisins and violet creams. Long finish. Quality LBV such as this with structure will improve with bottle age."

Medium plus flavour intensity of mostly primary flavours and medium plus finish. Compared to a ruby acidity and tannins are medium plus and more tertiary flavours. Very good. Lacking intensity to make it any more than that. Suitable for bottle ageing  with medium plus tannins  and acidity and lots of fruit
18331,1368603,"Very good representation of style and close to quality to Vintage Port.  Balance between the flavor intensity, alcohol and tannin levels at the high end give a long finish.  Complexity from developed fruit flavors and deliberate oxidation adds depth.  Deep ruby color. Blackberry, Black cherry, oak, coffee, caramel, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, figs, licorice, dried blackberry.  Medium + acidity, high tannins that are integrated, full-body, high alcohol, long finish. "
18332,1368603,"LBV is such a reliable port variation with great value, well worth the extra investment over a regular ruby or tawny... This Ramos Pinto confirms it from the earthy nose with nutty notes and bursting, black cherry to the palate with very nice acidity, measured sweetness, some tannins and plenty black fruit. 3.9"
18333,1368603,"Second port today. Enjoying this. Deep deep ruby. Smells like overripe raspberries, blackberries, plum. Some chocolate and tobacco. Mouth is similar with some vanilla, anise and hint of oak. Lil pepper at the end. Pleasantly sweet with tannins and alcohol to match. This was fun. Happy I tried something new today."
18334,1368603,"Tobacco, chocolate, blackberry on the nose. Medium tannin. M- acidity. Blackberry, chocolate, oak on the palate."
18335,1368603,"Black currant colour with a cherry red rim. Nose of morello cherry and it’s syrup. Very full bodied with intense stewed cherry flavour and a dry finish, backed up by an alcoholic fire."
18336,1368603,"Rich flavor, supple and sweet, would be good with cheese and liver "
18337,1368603,"Good Porto! Sweet and spicy Oak, prunes and chocolate! Dry fruits, cherry and raisins aftertaste!"
18338,1142314,"4.3. It strikes me as a lot of fun on the nose, though on the palate it is a lot more stern and heavy. It needs time to open up and it becomes completely different when had with food. I could smell it for decades though - such a depth. "
18339,1142314,"Top Douro white.  👃 nose is nutty, flowers,  honey,  grass. Top acidity with Rabigato grape. Long, good for every occasion. "
18340,1142314,"Blackberries, smooth, beautiful deep red color, perfect with Portuguese cheese and red meat, slight chocolate scent, and cinnamon traces. Although quite good already, I believe it will be wonderful if let it age another 2 years."
18341,1142314,"This is a wonderful Douro red wine. Fully bodied and soft, this tanic wine holds all the Douro valley flavours with parfums going from lavander to oak and prunes. What a great option for meat courses"
18342,1142314,"40 percent TN. Also TF, Sousao, Alicante Bousqet, Syrah, Baga and several other varieties. Clear, deep purple.

18382,3705139,We visited the Quinta just before the harvest. This vintage is very pleasant and different to 2017. A taste that reminds us of the winery. Again Dirk has worked wonders. Fruity with low acidity and a distinctive aftertaste. 18 more bottles in cooler!

18398,1415392,Light fruity nose but on tasting as it opens up you get dark fruit and a bitter dark chocolate. Really nice with food and a great example of good Douro wine
18399,1415392,"A really nice red from Douro, Portugal.  Dark ruby red, dry, full bodied.  Aroma of ripe dark fruit, chocolate.  Bold taste with hints of black currant, pretty high tannins.  It has pretty good acidity and still needs to age."
18400,1415392,14% Excellent Portuguese from Douro.  Wood flavor very intense Strong body Very dark color 
18401,1415392,Full bodied but very easy to drink
18402,1415392,"Very bright and dark purple colour. Intense nose showing floral notes, layers of ripe dark fruit, some new oak, almond and pepper. The palate has plenty of stuffing, fine nuance, layers of cassis and cherry with a peppery spiciness, ripe but present tannin, some chocolate notes, discreet oak and a long, lingering finish, complex and layered with fine potential."
18403,1415392,"Splendid nose of ripe fruit, medium to full bodied with high quality tannins but a bit harsh yet, showing it will be much better within a year or two. Nice long end"
18404,1415392,"A clear, deep colored ruby red wine. It has clean and pronounced aromas of black/dried fruit, quince, dairy and oak. On the mouth we got medium sweetness, medium-plus acidity, medium-plus round tannin and medium body. The quince fades while the black fruits get more intense, maintaining the oak and dairy notes.  An above-average finish for an above-average wine that is really worth the money."
18405,1415392,"This is fantastic vine. Very complex, very impressive. Aroma is typical, red fruits and berries. But structure! It goes from soft and round in the beginning to rough and bitter in medium body and to soft and long finish."
18406,1415392,"In hindsight although this a very pleasant portugese wine, this time I could only score it 3.75 ⭐️ ultimately. Still soft and really approachable "
18407,1415392,"Highly recomended to oxygenate. Tanins quite dry but it opens up. Honest and frank. It does not convey many messages beside one of frankness. Unfortunately quite low on acidity.   Aromas of ripe red forest fruits. Floral, violetes. Liquorice. Rosemary. In mouth, a little bit astringent but within its personality boundaries."
18408,1415392,Fruity aromas. Strong wine high alcohol. Light bitter with tannines. Long persistent aftertaste. Hints of wood.
18409,1415392,Fruity and beautiful!

18411,1415392,What a pleasant wine. Goes very well also with fish and chocolate cake 👍
18412,1415392,"Absolutely fab, great nose "
18413,3948167,"Something unaccustomed for me.  Color is transparent red, ruby.  Taste is unique. Try it cooled ❄️ Subtle notes of oak in the taste make the wine elegant. Alvarinho gives tenderness. An amazing combination of these grape varieties.  Food can be different - seafood or meat, grills, Italian cuisine, Asian, Oriental cuisine, Chinese.  Occasions: lunch, brunch, dinner. Celebrating, romantic, business events, even beaches.  oak raisin raspberry blackberry wild strawberry minerals cranberry pomegranate red currant"
18414,3948167,"Dark purple in colour. Dark cherry, blackberries, black currants, and herbal notes in the aroma. Flavour of tobacco notes, cherry, and blackberries. Light bodied. 83."
18415,3948167,"1st red from Soalheiro-blend of Vinhao, Pinot Noir&Alvarinho-perhaps the lightest red wine I ever tasted from PT though remarkable&fresh. Minho terroir delivers these mineral crispiness features doesn't matter what color (clean ruby in this case) is in the bottle. N: cranberry, sour cherry, flowers, medic.herbs&leathery dust, mineral notes. P: light bodied with fresh acidity&v.soft, melted tannins. M.long aftertaste delivers herbs&spice, sourness of red berries. My no.1 preference for grilled salmon. 3,7"
18416,3948167,"Very divisive wine which is more appreciated by lists of light reds. Delicate red fruit aromas with herbaceous undertones, high acidity and shift tannins. Pairs very well with grilled the steak. Served 14 degrees Celsius."
18417,3948167,"Fun & fresh wine. Not really complex but a pleasure to drink. Not an everyday blend of Vinhão (70%), Alvarinho(15%) and Pinot Noir(15%). Red cherry, lime and  some flint. With 12.5% alcohol and the lovely medium high acidity makes it a nice summertime wine. At € 16,50 a very good value. "
18418,3948167,An interesting and easy drinking red. Light in style with distinctive red fruit flavours. Light oak characteristics accompany this wine nicely. Certainly worth having some more.
18419,3948167,"Dry Almost not acidic  Serve cold, which is unusual Strawberries, raspberries, lime and melon "
18420,3948167,Light smooth flavorful 
18421,3948167,"Nice! A northern Portuguese blend of red and white wine that delivers a crisp and light red not dissimilar to a light Burgundy red. Substantial aging potential according to the winemaker; up to 10 years.  A rich nose with raisins, brambles and herbal tones.  On the palate med+ acidity, light, balanced and in line with the nose. Elegant. Med+ finish. Very good. 15 pts @ Okhuysen  "
18422,3948167,"A very drinkable, delicate northern Portuguese Pinot Noir. With notes of strawberry and red fruits. Drunk in Lisbon"
18423,3948167,Unusual mix of a red fleshed grape and alvarinho. Light and lovely.
18424,3948167,"(4,2) This is interesting! Lighter style of red with the local red grape Vinhao with some white Alvarinho added! That makes for an interesting, atypical wine. Zesty, with nice refreshing citrus notes, most probably because of those Alvarinho grapes. Smell of bread, flowers, refreshing red fruits. High acidity. Lemons. Precise. Redcurrant, strawberries, lemon zest."
18425,3948167,"Elegance in red vinho verde.   Original as a great white wine/vinho verde producer came up with this blend of red (Vinhao) and white (Alvarinho) variety, result is very interesting. Ripe sour cherries, violets, some spice on nose. Very smooth tannins, fresh and very elegant, a more summer style low alcohol red. Really enjoyed it, and if tasted blind would probably have to think about it a couple of times before guessing. "
18426,3948167,"Curious, light, mineral, Monção e Melgaço red. It's mainly Vinhão, but with 15% Alvarinho. Vinhão makes light-bodied, acidic wines, so blending it with white grapes creates an unusual red/white hybrid. Red berries, apricot and peach fruit. Dry, low tannins. It works quite well around 16C, although becomes rather subdued any cooler. Good with some simple salmon noodles.  Wine trivia: 40% of Vinho Verde wines are tart, brightly coloured reds, made mainly from Vinhão. "
18427,3948167,Nice surprise for a Alvarinho usually famous for its white wine...

18432,3775535,"(3.8) This 2012 Barraida Reserva has already peaked, but is still in the game. Oak aged 9 months.  Touriga Nacional driven. Comes with a dry tannic approach with flavours of red currant, chocolate, violet and green herbs. Medium full on the palate with bags of polished (by age) tannins and saline minerals.   Overall an elegant flavourful wine on the light side. Enjoy on it's own without interfering food and breathe 3h prior.   "
18433,3775535,"Still quite dark red colored, very dense on the palate, nose with elegant red fruit tones and a tiny bit of spicy. Palate filled with deliciously matured fruit with velvety tannins, nice integrated wood staging, good length. An honest wine made with care and with good quality. A very good value for money. 10€ in a restaurant..."

18445,1290538,Its so dark and intense. The connection to Cabernet Franc is obvious. Taste of peppers is obvious - needs some food to go with it...

18449,1290538,"A delicate fresh red from Douro. Not those full bodied ad nauseous wines but delicately crafted with depth and long on the finish. Red berries, light cassis. We like it"
18450,1290538,"First experience with these portuguese grapes. Nose is fruity and peppery, palate is slightly acidic but still very round and balanced. Not too heavy. Great wine."
18451,1290538,Deep garnet red. Fresh aromas of red fruits with well-integrated wood notes. Very fresh and clean on the palate with soft tannins and balanced acidity.

18456,1290538,"Very decent blend of: TN, TF, Tinta Barroca and Tinta Roriz from Douro, 2015. Balmy fruity intensive aroma with lots of ripen berries, notes of honney and leather. Med(+) body, bright moderate tannins, balanced lovely acidity as well as carefully balanced structure. On the palate notes of herbs, black currants mixtured with blackerries and cherries.  Long aftertaste followed with leavings of tannins, TN common bitterness and hint of oak.  Very solid blend, solid 4 and promise to myself to taste it again!"
18457,81431,"Smells of flowers on the verge of dropping petals. It's smooth with horehound candy, licorice, graham cracker, and vanilla."
18458,81431,"Why bother rating a legend? The wine is perfect and something if you are lucky enough to try, pause, breathe and just let it wash over you. Wine like this is rare and to enjoy it is an honor and pleasure!"
18459,81431,"Perfect match. Little chilly now, after lunch, reading a work report and plaguing while with Vivino. I have been a bit away due to a high work load. But now, just a glass of this astonishing Port, licorish, bold, potent, caramel, aged dried berries and a Epicure (one of my favorites) Cuban cigar.   Enjoy like wine friends!   Cheers "

18464,81431,"99 points. Vintage 2019 opened in 2021. 👀The color is deep purple. 👃The nose is offering blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, oak and eucalyptus. 👅The palate is bold! Its offering blackberry, vanilla, baking spices, cloves and black currant. Long aftertaste! Keeps evolving! The tannin structure is amazing! A fast tasting at the quinta, not for long showed the wine with a little suttle nose but the palate is very complex. Medium tannins and high acid. "
18465,81431,"100 Nose had overripe plums, figs, dates and nuts. Flavor had figs, overripe plums, raisins, dates,  honey and rich red forrest berries. Still plenty of acid left. Magnificent!"
18466,81431,"From a 2 hectare vineyard, with ungrafted vines and untouched by phylloxera, planted with varieties such as Tinta Francisca, Touriga Nacional, Sousao… Let’s get back to this wine, at first it was not really showing much, it really needed time to open up, very complex wine crispy and very spicy at first, with grilled notes, round and luscious wine, then after a while displayed notes of celery, cedar, cigar – the tannins are showing power while being smooth. A great wine. Average price 657€ on WineSearcher."
18467,81431,"This is not old for port anyway, but it’s very refreshing how young and inviting and “easy drinking” it is (in the best possible way). It’s almost on a red fruit side and quite light. Very interesting. "
18468,81431,"What really stands out is the wine qualities of this port. It is refined and elegant like a Burgundy, overwhelmingly complex, and layered with dark fruit, fig, honey, violet and bitter sweetness. The acidity is popping. Beautiful."
18469,81431,"Outstanding, a rare finesse with a mi d-blowimg complexity. Powerful, nutty and rooty yet silky and almost burgundian on the finish. A privilege!"
18470,81431,"Still deep ruby colour although rim lightening. Beautiful nose of spice, candied fruit, Christmas cake, cognac. Decanted and ready for the holidays!"

18472,81431,"Dark purple colour, stains the glass.  On the nose plums, dark chocolate, coffee and some minerals.  On the palate full bodied, sweet with layers of fresh fruit, some firm tannins and a long finish.  This is a powerhouse with a huge future ahead."
18473,81431,The king is in the place :) Nacional !!! So young and so perfect balance already ! :) see you in a few years :)

18475,81431,"This is a perfect wine. It's the best wine of 2011 and one of the world's top wines in the last decades. Tasted young , I am waiting for him in 20 years. I imagine myself flying."
18476,81431,"Hard tanins, but delicious."
18477,81431,outstanding port only viable outside brasil...price here is outrageous
18478,81431,"Balance, tar, wild, rock. Delivers. Effortless, assessable. Perhaps 5? But for that will have to wait."
18479,81431,Simply outstanding  What a beautiful port
18480,81431,Bought on line Wired for Wine June 2014
18481,81431,"99 points. Vintage 2019 opened in 2021. 👀The color is deep purple. 👃The nose is offering blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, oak and eucalyptus. 👅The palate is bold! Its offering blackberry, vanilla, baking spices, cloves and black currant. Long aftertaste! Keeps evolving! The tannin structure is amazing! A fast tasting at the quinta, not for long showed the wine with a little suttle nose but the palate is very complex. Medium tannins and high acid. "
18482,81431,"100 Nose had overripe plums, figs, dates and nuts. Flavor had figs, overripe plums, raisins, dates,  honey and rich red forrest berries. Still plenty of acid left. Magnificent!"
18483,81431,"Spicy, med to med-full body, subtle fruit on the finish."
18484,81431,"Smells of flowers on the verge of dropping petals. It's smooth with horehound candy, licorice, graham cracker, and vanilla."
18485,81431,"Solid, great with desert."
18486,81431,"Outstanding, a rare finesse with a mi d-blowimg complexity. Powerful, nutty and rooty yet silky and almost burgundian on the finish. A privilege!"

18488,1689617,"3,8⭐Good T. Nacional monovarietal this classic from Dão. 👀Deep ruby. Scarse and blurry tears. 👃Intense and interesting nose: ripe black fruits, cherry, leather, earthy & hint of balsamic. 👅Balanced, medium-full body, dry, nice complexity. Round tannins and medium+ acidity. 🏁Medium finish but with nice intensity. Spices. 🗒️This has been sitting in my cellar for quite some time, but I swear it can easily take at least another 5 years there.🧓 It kept growing over the 1h30 of aeration, didn't try further."
18489,1689617,"Moderately intense dark fruit on the nose with hints of spice and rustic characteristics (cut grass, forest floor, etc) but the dark fruit switches to waves of red plum and cherry while keeping the moderate density.  The rustic scents linger at the back of the nose while the spices integrates into the palate.  The layers have very broad range and lingering transitions with very light contrasts from tobacco and graphite in the background.  Balance is a bit off with only hints of acidity."
18490,1689617,"Ruby color.  Smooth aroma, with notes of red and violet fruits and some chocolate. It presents a smooth attack, is medium bodied  and shows round tannins. Short aftertaste. "
18491,1689617,92pts me  A beautifully aged example of some of the finest in Portugal  Nose iron rusty crushed dried orange peel with muddy crushed dried prunes   A bit of nutmeg and a bit cinnamon   Sweet ripe soft dried cherries combine with rusty nails towards a very velevty texture on a long fine finish   Impressive
18492,1689617,"Dark red color, different fruits and flowers and a subtle hint of white oak. Mild tannins, no obvious acidity, playin nicely with palate. Bright finishing. "
18493,1689617,"30 euro to try out a 1974 bottle! Well worth the guess, and it paid of. What a delicious wine, with a great character"
18494,1689617,Nice dry. With a slight bite
18495,1689617,Had 1984 vintage over a cabbage dish at Belcanto in Lisbon. Beautiful deep golden colour. Oily nose with hints of honey as well. Body is very subtle and little or no acidity but that’s quite expected for the vintage. Bit of smoke and hints of pepper and citrus in the finish 
18496,1689617,"From a winery steeped in the history of Dão wine founded in 1920 by two brothers, this was a delightfully different treat. Popped and poured, our initial sniff and sip gave away its age. Earthy aromas with underbrush, herbs and surprisingly lively red fruits on the palate. Burgnut described the mouthfeel quite aptly as like a ""rusty nail."" This may not sound appetizing but this is a wine that's better experienced and drank than my words can describe. Thanks Burgnut for sharing this Portuguese gem. Viva Dão!"
18497,1689617,"A great foil for a mature Burgundy especially in the first 30-45 minutes before the sourness in the finish takes greater prominence. Rusty nails and forest floor notes in the nose and palate combined with rose petals, wild strawberries, Asian spices, plums and worn leather. Excellent entry but the mid-palate is short on depth and complexity which is where it departs from a solid Burg and morphs into an aged Rioja.   Easily the best Portuguese dry red I've tasted."
18498,1689617,"4.2...  Beautiful notes of red fruit, pine, mushroom, cigar, and perfume. This is medium bodied and elegant. The wine has the texture of a Village level red Burgundy. If this finish was a tad longer, this would be through the roof amazing. "
18499,1689617,"Delicious wine and amazing value for the age. Unfortunately the nuance faded quickly once opened. Old peat, smoke, plum prune, raisin. Felt similar to an amarone. "
18500,1689617,"Excellent state of conservation, lovely evolved color still with tannin enough and some fruit in mouth for the current age"
18501,1689617,"Brick red. Plums, good and balanced tannins. Long velvety taste . Amazingly good for such an ols wine."
18502,1219022,"4,3⭐My first Castelão monovarietal.. And what a wine! 😎 👀Dark ruby. Abundant and relatively fast tears. 👃Terciary right after opening which eases after a bit of aeration. Oak, vanilla, plum, blackberry, black currant, cocoa. 👅Balanced, medium-full body, good complexity. Dry, round and velvety tannins. Medium acidity. 🏁Medium finish with toast and a hint of smoke in the aftertaste. 🗒️Got it for a bit <10€, but I think is possible to get for ~8€ on promotions. Great PQR, will buy again for sure."
18503,1219022,Surprising wine. Lots of power. Lots of black fruit oak and vanilla. A very nice balance
18504,1219022,"4.15 Really enjoyed this wine overall. On the nose, chocolate, tobacco, mint, rosemary. On the palate, leather, tobacco, with a strong earthy finish. Hesitated with a 4.2. "
18505,1219022,"Exceptional wine. Abundance of flavor and texture. Leather, tobacco, oak and floral notes. I don’t taste grape. Great aroma   Bright bouquet. "
18506,1219022,Oak leather tobacco dark chocolate  black fruit blackberry blackcurrant
18507,1219022,"Big and bold, wine bar sponsored by this winery, this is their high end red. Purple color, intense notes of cassis, pepper. A bit sweet blue fruit on the mid palate, well balanced, nice blend. Made me think of a Merlot from California. "
18508,1219022,"Nose brings notes of dark berries, notably blackberry or cherry, even signs of pepper and leather. Mouth presents taste of blueberry and a very pleasant tickling sensation that comes from pepper. Light body with short finish."
18509,1219022,Vinho encorpado com travo a frutos silvestres. Aroma intenso com longo paladar no final. 
18510,1219022,"A little sweet for my taste. Reminiscent of an estate library; a bit of leather, a bit of smoke. "
18511,1219022,Fruity and smooth. Match well with spicy food
18512,1219022,Okay… not the best… good with tomato sauce 
18513,1219022,"Great quality. Elegant, smooth and bery fruity. Chocolate, plum, black cherry and some hints of vanilla and leather. All well balanced,tannins not to high. Superb."
18514,1219022,Classic Setúbal red. High quality red. Highly recommended. Elegant. Made from Castelão grapes just a couple of kilometers south of Lisbon.
18515,1219022,"High quality and elegant value wine. Vanilla and black fruit on the nose. Luckily the oak is not used extensively and vanilla gives nice rounded nuances for the wine with plum, leather, blackberry and some bilberry. Very nice wine."
18516,1219022,"High quality and elegant wine. Vanilla and blackberry on nose. A little smell of oak, rich chocolate, mellow coffee, mixed with a hint of vanilla and blackberry, bring a very good round flavor to the wine. Good wine."
18517,2188922,"Very smooth and mellow reminiscent of a merlot. Lots of berry and vanilla flavours. Equally enjoyable by itself, as with food. "

18521,2188922,A nice clean white; very crisp.
18522,2188922,"Strong tannins, fruity and bold. Good color. Important: this 2018 year is to soon to drink it. It needs at least 1, 2 more years. Not before middle 2022. "
18523,2188922,"Medium body, acidity, strong- medium tannins, medium finish, dry, black fruits, blackberry, plum, prune, cherry, pomegranate, pepper, cinnamon, good wine "
18524,2188922,"Very elegant, rich with a scent and taste wine, recommend for all! "
18525,2188922,"Great aroma of maturity and berries. The initial taste also amazing, a palate pleased with taste... however, it has middle ending and bitterness in background. Nevertheless, it is perfect to have with red meat and other heavy food."
18526,2188922,"Cherry, plum and black fruit! Great ruby red colour with a smooth velvet balance!"
18527,2188922,Cost value wine! Had with Chinese egg and veggies stir fry. Was great!!

18533,1940544,"A Touriga Nacional but not as you know it… It’s a very light salmon colored rosé and the light body type. Good for the Portuguese summers.  Floral, mineralic nose with raspberry and white pepper followed by a very mellow palate with restrained acidity, raspberry, strawberry and sweet edge. 3.3"

18542,16385,"The current bag on box fridge wine is a very decent and nice value refreshing blend for those long and finally somewhat warm late spring/early summer evenings. Nice floral and sweet fruity almost floral honey nose. On the palate nice oily texture in fact, with juicy yellow fruit, apple and cantaloupe, nice acidity, not too racy here like a vinho verde might be, but creamy and balanced and tasty! Summer wine for sure!"

18549,16385,Great and not too sweet. Lovely 
18550,16385,"An example of excellent value for money from Portuguese wines. Bright citrus, grapefruit, floral, lemon oil. Would be delightful with Indian food."

18552,16385,"Tropical, caramel, melon on the nose, honey. Interesting."
18553,16385,"First impressions are that this wine is one grassy mama. Bit average for $14 a pop though.   Citrus of the lime variety, bit of Pear. Not shabby but probably won't go again."
18554,16385,"Lots of pear fruit, the oak influence being pretty minor just adding an interesting bit of complexity."
18555,1306828,"Our “house wine”. A great match for everything from pastas, pizzas to lighter bbq sessions. Not enough tannins for the heavier steak/sauce dinners but perfect for most any other occasion and very drinkable. "

18610,1884612,"(4.3*) Quinta da Romaneira wine tasting. Full details on www.vaocubo.com In my opinion was the best of the afternoon. Fantastic Petit Verdot aged for 14 months in French oak. I love this grape and it's not easy to find great wines 100% PV.  Deep purple in color with forest fruits aromas and cassis notes. On palate is smooth and rich with fruity tannins and flavors of blueberries, ginger and cedar. Finished fruity and very persistent."
18611,1884612,"91pts me 92pts by WE   100% Petit verdot, Quinta da Romaneira is known for several of their single varietal Douro wine: syrah, PV, Touriga National   All of them excellent and interesting   Beautiful vibrant deep purple color with sweet nose of black currant hint of oak and ripe strawberries.   A sense of place with ripe fruit and minerality   Interestingly, this is medium body with soft sweet ripe tannin   Bravo to the Douro valley"
18612,1884612,Beautifully soft to drink with certainly a sense of Vanilla. I’ve not had much of this grape before and so was glad we tried this one. Paired with my favorite BBQ dishes.
18613,1884612,"Medium body, firm tannins. Plums with vegetal notes. Impressive wine "
18614,1884612,"Cassis tabaco, encorpado, prolongado no paladar!"
18615,1884612,Tks my Lord 🙏🙏
18616,1884612,"I’ve not tasted Petit Verdot as a single varietal wine before. And I wouldn’t have expected it to be Portuguese. But what better place to grow this grape than in the beautiful furnace of the Douro Valley. Produced by the great Quinta Da Romaneira, this is a banker.   Heavy laden with black cherry and plum. Firm but rounded tannins, concentrated but not overripe, it has superb balance for such a big, rich wine. With a long, sumptuous baked fruit finish that goes on and on. Delicious 🇵🇹 ⭐️"
18617,1884612,"Wow, don't have Petit Verdot very often at all. Just hard to find I guess. Saw it on the list and figured I'd give it a go. Black cherries and blueberries. Floral and herbal on the nose too. High tannins were really accessible. Great balance. Wine of the night for my group. "
18618,1884612,"4,1- again great PV already rated. Really fresh lively red fruits. At this stage very ready to drink"
18619,1884612,"Tannic, black fruit, blackcurrant, oak, cocoa. Nice! "

18621,1884612,This was really delicious. I was impressed. Full body. Complex. Full mouth. Really good
18622,1884612,"Very fruity and elegant Syrah. Fragrant stewed fruits on the nose. Smooth palate of plums, dark cherries, hints of chocolate. I expected something bold and powerful. It does have noticeable alcohol, but still feels quite soft, with polished tannins.  Like the Romaneira Petit Verdot - I enjoyed it but wouldn’t pay €20 for it again. There are plenty of cheaper options that provide the same level of enjoyment."
18623,1573014,Airport lounge wine number three. It's white bit I think I taste some oak which should be impossible. I just ate some seafood so the nose kinda smells like fish? I like though. Definitely would drink again. 
18624,1573014,Very enjoyable medium bodied wine. 
18625,1573014,Great value young dâo.
18626,1573014,"Good one, medium body, high acidity, medium tannins, hints of black cherry, prunes, black pepper, pomegranate in the aftertaste. Easy drinking on its own. "
18627,1573014,"Jammy plum and black cherry aromas. Peppery and alcoholic at the nose. Highly gastronomic, high tannins would most probably appreciate some aging. Black pepper, leather, black berries."
18628,1573014,Just had it as a suggestion from waitor in Portugal. My wife likes lighter variety with pleasant nose. It actually just a bit dry. Easy drinking. Smooth citrus and appricote.  $12 box in restaurant I say it is unbeatable value
18629,1573014,Good typical Dao red: red fruits; earthy notes a lot of character; if you really like Wine you will like it 
18630,1573014,Talking to The Angels 
18631,1573014,Felt ambivalent about this one. Liked the Albariño with dinner more. It was just a little flat and didn’t complement our food. Some evidence of oak. Some red fruit but no sharpness and refreshing acidity. Fine but not something I would revisit.  
18632,1573014,Somewhat underwhelming. Better dão out there. 
18633,1573014,Good price performance from Daoa region. Medium to smooth
18634,1573014,"dry, tart pomegranate notes, medium bodied "
18635,1573014,Mellow raspberry easy to drink

18637,1573014,Light with black currant tones. Good flavour
18638,1274393,"Blend of Alicante Bouschet, Syrah and Touriga Nacional. Dark ruby color. Aroma of red fruits and chocolate. Perfect for red meat."
18639,1274393,"Full-bodied red with dark cherry, black fruit, earth, some leather, a bit of vanilla, and oak notes. Great with robust meats and cheeses. "
18640,1274393,"Blend of 50% Alicante Bouchet, 40% Touriga Nacional and 10% Syrah from Alentejano 🇵🇹.  Black fruit, bramble and cherry. Hints of mint and violets.  Well balanced. Velvety texture and smooth tannins.   Not my fave style but it’s just yummy 😋"
18641,1274393,"A very good wine with potential to turn outstanding. Medium ruby to garnet. In the nose, pronounced wit cherry, red currant, dried strawberry, violet, floral, coconut, thyme, tomato leaf. On the palate, medium intensity with primary, secondary, and tertiary flavors. High acidity, full body, high tannins, bone-dry, high alcohol.  "
18642,1274393,"Very subtle on the nose, but so full bodied , cedar , oak , some sweet notes liqoirice , Chocolate , "
18643,1274393,"Subtle nose, very well balanced "
18644,1274393,"Nice ‘cellar smell’. I enjoyed this, without any further notes"
18645,1274393,oak plum cedar tobacco 
18646,1274393,Today for me: 3.9
18647,1274393,Full bodies red. Needs decanting but smooth on the palate and not too fruity. 
18648,1274393,Wood and smooth. Excellent smell
18649,1274393,"Liked it from as soon as the cork popped! Soft and balanced with a nice finish. Alentejo wines are fast becoming my favourites, wish I could access some of the more obscure selections. "
18650,1274393,"Full of taste: clove, chili pepper, black pepper,  cedar, tobacco, plum, coffee, nutmeg, black cherry, leather, earthy character and notes of ginger. Complex and beautiful! "
18651,1274393,"Subtle red fruits, a little oaky , tannic , acidic . A little disappointing. "
18652,1274393,"Very nice strong red fruits, nice oaky finish. Very nice strong red."
18653,8465022,"Intense aroma of red forest fruit, predominantly raspberry.  In the mouth it surprises by the smoothness and balance.  Wine still young, with very present tannins, advising a few years of aging. Great price."
18654,8465022,"Blackberries and black cherry in the nose. Medium bold, dry, yet fruit-forward in the attack with more blackberry and some stone and leather hints in the body. Tannins up front that last throughout. The finish improves as the wine breathes. "
18655,8465022,"Ok wine, too much acidity in my mind, for 8€ I think there are much better wines in Dão"
18656,1597127,"89/100 Barrel fermented Antão Vaz in 500L oak. Single vineyard white wine. Notes of oak, white peach, and lemon. This is phenolic and full, it’s a neutral tasting grape but done well. Salty and long finish."
18657,1597127,Like taking medicine. Very herbal almost bitter on the palate but very light and special. The nose is less herbal but nice airy light. 
18658,1597127,"Olho de Mocho Reserva Branco is produced from the Antão Vaz variety, which offers exuberant aromas and tropical notes.  Well structured and dense, these wines are characteristic of the Alentejo region, namely the Vidigueira area. The shows citrus color sand a intense mineral aroma with floral notes.  In the mouth, it has a fine palate and excellent acidity, which gives it immense freshness.  Medium and tasty aftertaste."
18659,1597127,"Antao Vaz from Herdade de Rocim. Nice place to visit with great amphora wines. This complex white, a single vineyard which is somewhat special, has a floral nose at first after when clearly oak and vanilla jumps onto your sense combined with ripe pear, dried pineapple. Fresh on the palate with mainly apple, citrus, pear and some white pepper with honey in the medium long finish. Tastes surprisingly not as heavy as it smells. Interesting bottle, especially when you go and get it at the spot :)"
18660,1597127,oak apple peach 
18661,1597127,It worth 3.9
18662,1597127,"High acidity, good minerality and a medium plus complexity. Taste of apricot,  apple,  pear and  peach with a medium plus finish. "
18663,1597127,"Gold color on the glass. Oak, vanilla, peach and apple, earthy and minerals. Really balanced, very nice body and medium low acidity. Nice white wine."
18664,1597127,"Pale lemon in color. Nose of medium intensity with apple, peach, yogurt, butter. On the palate it’s dry, medium acidity, high alcohol, medium body, medium (-) finish, medium flavour intensity. Very good wine. "
18665,1597127,"Citrus fruit, pear, floral notes, smoky and mineral. Earthy, herbal finish."
18666,1597127,"Light, fruity and dry. Clear oak notes with lemon and green pineapple. With shellfish, oysters etc"
18667,1597127,"Oak, Apple, light tastes of lemon and butter. Very earthy with mushroom and lemongrass notes and a lingering flavour of sea salt. Very herbal with a long finish. "
18668,1597127,Same notes as the last time. Well balanced wine with an acid first start and notes of oak barrels that makes it a special wine.
18669,1597127,"The color of burnished gold, the 2014 Herdade do Rocim Olho de Mocho Reserva Branco offers up nuanced, complex aromas of quince paste, lemon curd, clover honey, marzipan, and golden raisins. At this stage in development, it’s softly textured—aging in terracotta and cement amphorae, as well as the presence of lees during aging, has graced this wine with ample creaminess at the mid-palate that’s nicely balanced by bright acidity. Cherimoya and bruised pear emerge on a mouthwatering finish. 13.5% ABV | Sample "
18670,1597127,"88 pts; light golden and bright; rich oak with butterscotch; full and rich in the mouth, and a solid finish; the oak still needs to soften but this is a nice rich wine that should develop nicely. Purchased at the winery for only 16 Euro. Recommended."
18671,5070250,Busto. Again a Douro Red that worth the effort.  We liked without restrictions.
18672,5070250,Touriga national is absolutely great and best grape of Portugal. Aroma is fantastic - silktree and blackberry. Hints of chocolate and spices...
18673,5070250,"Nice wine tasted. On the nose, broad spicy and wild aromas mingle with black fruits. The palate is generous, rather fruity, jammy with notes of sour cherries in brandy and coffee with a sunny final"
18674,5070250,"Tasty Touriga Nacional from Douro region. This wine doesn't reveal many aromas but had something interesting in it. I took once one glass in nice wine bar in Warsaw called Wino & People. Nose was at the beginning nothing special when smell but when got done breathe immediately I could feel blueberry, cherry and oak. Palate followed the nose but was more restrained than nose. A lot of work need to be done to pull the taste from this wine. Medium bold wine, expressive red in glass with medium long finish.    "
18675,5070250,"Visiting Douro is still on my bucket list. Until that wish is fulfilled I can count on my local Portuguese wine merchant. 2 hour decant enjoyed with homemade Lasagne. Black fruit on the nose, followed by a smooth texture and crisp finish despite the 14% ABV. Great table wine, really a wine for all tastes. "
18676,5070250,"One of many wines tasted during the Fairs ""Delicious Poland"" in the Centennial Hall in Wrocław last weekend. Powerful Touriga National. Very powerful wine. Wine with muscles. Intense Ruby colour with dominating red fruits on the nose. These red fruits are dominating also on the palate with hints of woody oaky flavours. Very firm strong tannins but very well integrated. All these flavours are just sticking to the palate and tongue making very long finish with long lasting aftertaste. We took 2 bottles. Saúde"
18677,5070250,"Very dark purple colour. Intense nose - pure, ripe and floral with cassis, blueberry, cherry and gingerbread spices. The palate is very dense and packed with dark fruit, fine peppery spiciness, a fresh backbone and mild tannin, good grip and length, warm and unctuous finish, a big wine just about to open up."
18678,5070250,Oaky chocolate notes with red fruit including ripe cherry!  An easy wine to drink with a balanced nose and great finish.  Not an all time favorite but would be happy to try this again
18679,5070250,Dark fruits with nice vanilla notes. Round and not too heavy
18680,5070250,So damn Good wine! Dark fruits and chocolate. Concentrated and cherry! Deep and with some nice acid
18681,5070250,"In the nose vanilla with reminescents of black fruits. Vanilla does not just cover fruits, it simply replace them. This lack of balance could be masked by some spicy, acidic food - that combination gives an extra points and makes it really drinkable.  3.5 solo, 3.7 well paired with food"
18682,5070250,Full body wine. Reserva Touriga Nacional. High acidity. It is suggested to decant at least for 1 hour.
18683,5070250,"Mature, layered, slate, blackberry, violets "

18691,2347859,"Needs a chill to keep the acid in balance. Once it warms up, the aromatics release and the finish comes apart.  Lots of lemon pith and muted/underripened stone fruits. Touch of cherry blossom and decent body for a white."
18692,2347859,"🔠 Alphabet Saturday A-Z of grapes. #35, Encruzado, thought to be from the Dão region & grown on just 295ha there. The berries oxidise easily & the variety takes well to oak.

18700,1191994,Spicy and oaky with a blend of mixed red fruit and dark fruit! A bit too acidic for me but still a good bottle!
18701,1191994,"The nose is beautifully subtle but rich - blackberry and raspberry, with oak, earthy notes, tobacco, touches of floral and a hint of spice, with the little sting of the 14.5% alcohol. The palate is very smooth, gently tart fruit, touches of vanilla and earth, long finish with aniseed at the end. Delightful wine, demonstrates balance perfectly"

18708,1191994,"Wonderful Douro - barely noticeable alcohol level despite its 14.5%, as it is so wonderfully balanced and smooth. Must be in peak drinking window now. "

18710,1191994,"The Quinta dos Frades Vinhas Velhas was produced from 90-year-old vines that were planted in terraces, as is typical of the Douro. Intense fruit and spicy-fruity aromas characterize this tasty wine along with mineral elements and smoky notes. On the palate, it presents itself flattering and attractive, with enormous depth and intensity. Juicy tannins and a pleasant acidity result in a long-lasting, very elegant finish"

18715,1509065,"Chewy, inky, earthy.  Great food wine - spices paired well with spicy Mediterranean braised chicken.  "
18716,1509065,Opaque dark purple in colour. Really intense blackberry and cherry fruit with some oak running through it. Acidity quite high and tannins quite firm but the full bodied nature of the wine make it well balanced. Good to drink now but will age well for a good few years

18718,1509065,Fantastic choice to taste with a fantastic friends

18729,1509065,Plum and red fruit 
18730,2178427,"Light red, a pommegranate colour, clear and a lovely aroma of wildberries and dark and white pepper. As taste goes, it has a beautifull acidity that blends very well with all the fruits and peppers it has in it. not as good as the 2010, at least yet, but still the best portuguese varietal syrah there is."
18731,2178427,"Another wine from Dão region, a varietal Syrah aged for 12 months in 1st and 2nd use French oak barrels. Dark rubi red color. Intense aromas of ripe red fruits and plum preserve with hints of oak, spices, cinnamon and minerals. Medium-bodied (14.0%), well-balanced Portuguese wine with nice and soft acidity and alcohol, properly counterbalanced by robust, velvety and elegant tannins. Finish is strong, smooth, savory and very persistent. A beautiful 90-GB pts wine!! Can live for several more years!!"

18762,1627273,"Adventure in odd oaky whites volume 9 (or more)... This is 58% Arinto, 24% Verdelho and 18% Antao Vaz. It's a little like the Esporao Reserva Branco but with a little less creaminess. Nose is salt lick, a little minerality and a touch of citrus. Palate is long, early acidity levels out quickly and a little roundness from the light (probably 2nd fill) oak contact. Very nice. "

18770,1142315,"4.2. Wine #3 was from dinner guest @[1|2319697|Aluísio Leibanti], a very beguiling wine from the Douro region (Alphabet Saturday ✅ 😀) in Portugal. Trying to guess this blind was difficult, as it's a wine of contrasts. Very purple in color, but with ageing notes. Powerful and dense. Black, red and blue fruit...the licorice and coffee and wood finish threw me off the trail. Loved the expressiveness! A blend of native Portuguese grapes including Touriga Nacional. Thanks Alu! 👍 🍷 🇵🇹 "
18771,1142315,Very enjoyable 92 points.  At the Miami wine spectator's Grand Tour. Way too many great wines. No time for reviews. Sorry. 
18772,1142315,"Dinner with confreres to share a bottle of the legendary Douro Boys, El Tranvia restaurant, August 31.  It’s always amazing taste this impressive wine, long life ahead.  Rate 4.7"
18773,1142315,"4.3@Gambrinus Lisbon. Family Christmas dinner. Paired with roast lamb. Impressive red bottle. Very dark, inky color. Powerful, rich, concentrated, yet exquisite balance of blend. It displayed complex & profound aroma such as blackberry, casis, smoke, spices, subtle green vegetable or herbs. Smooth, silky, till ending stage. Well-balanced strong tannin & lively acidity. Probably one of the youngest red I could enjoy so much, and potential to go. Excellent 👍👍👍"
18774,1142315,"94 points - dark purple; nose of licorice, forest floor, oak and black fruit and when it opens up, notes of cacao and coffee; taste of black currant, licorice, and chocolate with a lovely peppery finish. Smooth and elegant with big structure. Nicely rounded tannins."
18775,1142315,"From the oldest demarcated wine region in the world produced from the same old vineyards as the iconic Barca Velha we have this one of a kind world-class icon. Quinta do Vale Meão one of the last creations that forged the story of Dona Antonia. A dark Color wine, Garnet color and holder of a thick black tear in the glass. Deep in the nose, complex and with many aromatic nuances. In the mouth a vibrant bouquet where the ripe black fruit is predominant in an extremely elegant wine. 4.6"
18776,1142315,"Aroma: black fruit, plum, black currant. Notes of chocolate, oak, tobacco, some leather and dark earth.   Palate: very good longevity, excellent balance and soft feel.   Verdict; this was really good! It drink more like a Spanish Tempranillo wine than what I had in Douro over the last few days.  It is really top grade stuff, but the price is also starting to reflect that "
18777,1142315,"Incredible wine. Dark fruit, beautiful mid palate, great finish. Curious to see how it will developed with a few more Years in the bottle. Def a must have try."
18778,1142315,Excellent wine. Still young. Never disappoints

18780,1142315,For the money one of Portugal’s best.  Rich color flavor finish 
18781,1165304,"67 Pall Mall virtual tasting, 72ml samples, 4 hours air. Christian Seely's choice for a classic Noval to end the tasting. Medium tawny. Some subtle black fruit. A deep richness of chocolate, liquorice, woodsmoke, coffee. Maraschino cherry on the palate, mocha, cinnamon. Amazing silky texture. Harmony and freshness. Subtle sous bois, high acidity. Until the 70s a government monopoly supplied the aguardente spirit, and there is a coarseness to the alcohol here. Beautiful at 54 years old, emotional stuff."
18782,1165304,Best port... ever!
18783,1165304,"San Sebastián trip 🇪🇸 Day 8 : Dinner , Martín Berasategui ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Rating - 4.5 🍷 Happy end 😀"
18784,1165304,"Great wine which, maybe because of the bottle, was not at his absolute top. a bit too smooth, the bottle had passed the peak"
18785,1165304,This one hade probably aged faster as the cork was loose.
18786,1165304,"Full of black berries, cherries 🍒 with light aromatic herbal background, spicy - friendly and vibrant texture with nice tannins - it will keep aging beautifully "
18787,1165304,"TOP DOG PORT  Very young at this moment! Great nose with blackberries, figs, spice, tar, smoke, on the palate the alcohol is still present, licorice notes with plum and dark chocolate, a touch of cedar, round, creamy, long finsh... You must be patience with this....at least 10+ years but probeley two more decades! "
18788,1165304,"There is potential here! Still young, but already great! The tannins are still a bit rough but will well develop with time. Not too much sweetness and good acidity. Great finish that will become a 5/5 in few years in my opinion! Cheers 🍷"
18789,1165304,"Very good fully mature vintage. No oxidation, dense, meaty, tobaco aromas. Moderate sweatness, silky in the mouth. Long and perfectly balanced."
18790,1165304,"1963 - Roy Emerson won the French & Australian Championship (the latter on grass), Beatlemania gripped the world, the Vietnam war raged and the world lost JFK. Geelong won the VFL.  Pale pink with orange/tawny rim- outstanding bouquet.    Cherry, raisin, marzipan and walnuts, creme brûlée.   Elegant and impeccable length- outstanding @ 54 years of age. Builds with black liquorice and figs, acidity is soft and tannins fully resolved. Half a cup of sediment. Balanced alcohol."
18791,1165304,"At Lasarett, Torshov.  No detailed notes. Not quite up there with Niepoort 2017, but definitely a great package already!  94p"
18792,1165304,"Blackberry, chocolate and vanilla. It's intense already for nose. Light ruby color as you can expect for vintage. Intense experience."
18793,1165304,"This is a crowd pleaser. Very smooth with licorice, milk chocolate, and cherry notes. A bit of grassiness adds depth, but I don't think it needs it."
18794,1165304,"That was stunning, floral, fresh, delicate, well balanced with a fine structure and pure fruit. "
18795,1165304,"Rich, full, complex and very long lasting taste."
18796,1206377,"Tasted beside the 1977 Taylor with the winemaker David Guimaraens, it doesn't get better than this. Stunningly powerful yet full of grace, poise and timelessness. The purity of fruit and pulsating veins of acidity just like the Taylor but this 77 Fonseca had a slightly more refined mouthfeel and rounder explosion of fruit. This was my favourite wine of the tasting. "
18797,1206377,"For the Love of Port 2017 Meet Up - Chicago Voted the winner of the night, and well deserved! Beautiful beautiful wine with a good life ahead"
18798,1206377,A superb 1977 vintage port. Have had this about 30-35 times over the last 25 years and it definitely back in form. For a few years it was rather thin but now it is fantastic 
18799,1206377,"Wow !! This 1977 Fonseca is irresistibly good, boquet of ripe berries, prunes and raisins, taste of mocha, dark chocolate, coffee, and long fruity delicious aftertaste of ripe berries, this is on top now and does not get better just different and even more ripe with longer storage, I think this can last for at least another 40-50 years.  98p"
18800,1206377,"4.9. Absolutely stellar! So much complexity I don’t know where to start. Perfectly rounded with plenty of fruit left. More like a Tawny at this point, with lots of pecan, almond, caramel, toffee, earth notes, bitter chocolate, and a very long finish. Another glass please!"
18801,1206377,Was almost past it’s useful date. Cork was mostly in good shape but bottom 1/4” stayed in the bottle. Color was bricked; light orange. Last maybe 1 1/2” was sediment. Taste was great. Nose and taste was spot on. All our friends enjoyed this with us. 
18802,1206377,"Fantastic colour - old and with remarkable depth and power. Still has the vibrancy of the grape of a youthful wine. Dark garnet color. Touch of dark chocolate, blackberry, licorice, berries and spice. "
18803,1206377,Best port I've ever had. Rated 100. Had with Bev and Jim and Kerry and Kristen. A little concerned to bottle quality when we first opened it as the color was a little light. However it quickly opened up and the color darkened. Long finish. Flavor matured and morphed the longer it was open. Riedel glass improved flavor and aroma. Absolutely outstanding.
18804,1206377,"Pink and clear, viscous tart cherry, profoundly perfect flavors, caresses the heart with sweetness and delight. "
18805,1206377,Best VP i have ever tasted. 99 points
18806,1206377,"Very sweet. Deep caramel color. Still has lots of fruit. 100 pt WS and Suckling. Had this with Stilton, which toned down the sweetness. "
18807,1206377,"Again a perfect Vintage Port from Fonseca,1977 a true classic, amongst best ever."
18808,1206377,"Needed some air to breath, but after 6-7 hrs it opened up, showing licorice, dark cherry, raisin, smoke and some more body than when it was just opened. Is very clear and dark in the glass. A beautiful glass with a long life ahead of it too. "
18809,1206377,Beautiful transparency. The fruit has broken down into a soft velvety finish.
18810,1206377, From one of the more highly rated vintages of the last century this was perfect now.  Fabulous rich figgy fruit with lashings of chocolate and coffee all backed up by an acidic backbone that keeps the richness under control. Wonderful balance and decades of life left yet. Perfect to drink with a couple of great friends 
18811,1306913,"Bottle number 3!! Boy oh boy!!! This one is one of a kind! I don’t know if I will dp justice to the wine with my rating but trust me, you must taste it. 🍷 it won’t make a lot of sense, but it smells like a white one with citrus notes. Oak is definitely present, with plum and blackberries. 🍷 sweet and the right spot, medium bodied, medium acidity and awesome tannins. "
18812,1306913,"Red fruit, oak, vanilla, very rich taste. As usual in Portugal price-quality top wine. "
18813,1306913,"Super rare grape variety.  Close to Spanish Border region.  This is  very dry, dark,  earthy,  even metallic red. No sweet notes. Big pepper.  "
18814,1306913,"🇵🇹 Que belo tinto Duriense, visual granada escuro, aroma frutas vermelhas maduras com ligeiras notas de especiarias, chocolate e tabaco, no paladar é encorpado, elegante, cremoso, intenso e amadeirado, acidez e taninos equilíbrados final longo e fresco.  🇬🇧 What a beautiful Douro red, dark garnet look, ripe red fruit aroma with slight notes of spices, chocolate and tobacco, on the palate it is full-bodied, elegant, creamy, intense and woody, balanced acidity and tannins, long and fresh finish. "
18815,1306913,"Good flavors and aromas of fruit (black fruit and red fruit). Oak notes, that gives a sweet sensation, but cuts by a pleasant slight bitter (black chocolate). Ruby / violet color. Full-bodied, medium dry. Overall, on the olfactory / gustatory dimension it`s a pleasant wine. Alcohol in the level 14,5.°, which, for me, is too much for table wine and a less gastronomic aspect. Contains sulphites."
18816,1306913,"Cherry, complex notes and lasts on the pallet "
18817,1306913,"One of the best I’ve had in a while tbh. So glad it’s from Portugal. Smooth, vanilla. Dark fruit. Purple in colour "

18822,1306913,Excellent wine. Balance and smooth. Red fruits with a little of tabaco and learher 
18823,1306913,Pitch dark. Some wood on the nose but not exuberant. Needs air to open its flavours. Extremelly elegant with red fruits and some almond. Great Douro red.
18824,1306913,A beautiful wine with Douro character. Full bodied with enough tannic sharpness to suggest that this will keep some years.  
18825,1306913,"Very good wine. Very Extracted color, plums and dry cherries on the nose, some toast and leather, on the palate very refined tannins, rich, and an interesting dry style. The Douro 2014s persisting on heir beautiful freshness, great wines"
18826,1306913,Brilliant. Amazing value 
18827,1306913,"A fantastic wine, really smooth tannins, nose powered with herbs, mint. Still a baby, will forget some bottles in a hideaway to taste them in 5 years or so."
18828,1306913,"Another great QPR Douro wine. Dense, purple color, aromatic plum, dark cherry and leathery nose, medium full body, same flavors as nose. long finish, pleasantly drying tannins. I brought this back to US on a trip to Porto...Great to be drinking this tonight!"
18829,1306913,"My favorite wine without a doubt. Não fosse ele J.Rosas. Puro is inspired by a wine born in the late XIX century. In contrast to the North at the time, they created a hogh quality non-fortified wine in the Douro valley. A must at your table. Thank god its friday.🍷"
18830,1306913,".  Intense aroma of wild fruits, with a strong dominance of very ripe red fruit and some floral notes. In the mouth is balanced with tannins well present. Fresh and medium finish. Very gastronomic wine."
18831,1306913,"Fruity, bold and balanced with a nice nose. Easy wine to drink with pleasant undertones on the finish. "
18832,1306913,"A very bold wine, dark, with dark forest fruit flavours, cigar smoke and liquorice. Stunning tannins."
18833,1306913,"Very Good wine! Good balanced nose, with a oaky palate, and nice long finish! Very good wine!!!"

18837,1306913,Portuguese ham and wine. Great combination but sadly the ham well and truly outperformed the wine tonight.

18856,1165304,"2004 was relatively dry and cool in the Douro. Noval declared, while Symington and Fladgate produced some top end single Quinta wines. This is very densely coloured, with a garnet rim. Black fruit and violet on the nose, slightly medicinal. The palate is sweet, concentrated and tannic. Feels younger than 16 years. Stony, earthy minerals; liqourice and chocolate. Delicious, impressive, validates Noval's decision to make a vintage port. Keep for now; open 2025 onwards. "
18857,1165304,"One of my favorite port houses. This one is magnificent.   So many layers of aromas to discover. What I like is the vinous style, it is not as sweet as others. It has some edge."
18858,1165304,"Pure elder berries. Maybe a bit too simple, but very drinkable! Fine acidity, present but not overwhelming tannins, melted sugar-alcohol balance."
18859,1165304,"Spice, smoky, meat. Leather. Sweet spice. Not the pallet weight of the 2007 but so complex and delicious. A perfect port from Noval. Thanks "
18860,1165304,"Dulst 25y #10 Closing time!  What is better than a good tradition to close a tasting than a good and well aged Port?  Well good traditions never disappoint. This 2004 is great to end a exceptional tasting. The end of the tasting and begin of the midnight snack with a great cheese platter.   Typical port nose with dried raisins. The palate is fine and elegant with black cherries, dried raisins, orange zest, subtle vanilla and wood, spices and very fine body. Also with a long lasting finish!  Rate 4,0⭐️"
18861,1165304,"[Dulst 25 years conclusion] You can’t go wrong with fine, mature vintage port. This one is basically still an infant at 15 so unsurprisingly very fresh and a perfect pairing with some ripe cheeses. Earthy nose with mint, eucalyptus and blueberry followed by a palate with pleasantly contained acidity, fine acidity, characterful tannines, pepper, spices and raisins. 4.2 "
18862,1165304,"A matured vintage port, a cork in 1’000 pieces... Tar, earth and leather meet raisin, jam and dried red fruit. Dry, concentrated, surprisingly fresh, but not as juicy as expected. Present alcohol on the palate, kind of burning. Elegant style, but this is not an easy quaffer. Complex yet demanding! Not fully convinced if the bottle wasn’t slightly faulty... 4⭐️ anyway! "
18863,1165304,"Rich, full, complex and very long lasting taste."
18864,1165304,"Dark ruby colour.  On the nose plums, chocolate, mandarin orange blossoms and baking spices.  On the palate full bodied with chewy tannins, sweet, fresh fruit on the mid palate and a long sweet plum finish.  Still a long way to go for this one to settle in."
18865,1165304,Great Port! Great potential do age
18866,1165304,"Full of black berries, cherries 🍒 with light aromatic herbal background, spicy - friendly and vibrant texture with nice tannins - it will keep aging beautifully "
18867,1165304,"That was stunning, floral, fresh, delicate, well balanced with a fine structure and pure fruit. "
18868,1165304,"Excellent - lively, blackberry and black currant dominate"
18869,1165304,Tried with pasta with tuna. Super complimentary!
18870,1165304,Light and fruity. Almost 5.
18871,1175612,"Wonderful Porto.  Nose of honey, dried fruit.  Palate is a wonderful series of caramel, gold raisins, caramel, and chocolate, and red raspberry."
18872,1175612,Caramel but the nuttiness dominates. Sweet yet balanced with the smooth alcohol. I definitely would learn to love port when I grow older. 
18873,1175612,"Raisin Bread, Rose, Almond, Caramel, toffee, fig, honey, orange marmalade,   delicious and fresh, well structured and balance port. Very good. "
18874,1175612,"Spicy, richer style, more barrel notes, with little tannin profile and roasted coffee beans! Delicious, see you in a few more years"
18875,1175612,Wickedly indulgent. Gorgeously nutty with dried fig and raisin flavours. Rich and full in the mouth. Not a fan of sweet wines but this port has converted me. Had it with a rich chocolate mousse and it was spectacular!
18876,1175612,"Fine tawny red in colour, with a watery edge.  Beautiful nose of raisins, honey, fig jam, plus smoke and nail polish.  On the palate it's the same plus orange marmalade.  Finishes long with leather and notes of dried porcini mushrooms."
18877,1175612,"Father-in-law's birthday: champagne, red Bordeaux with roast rib of beef, and then this treat from Noval for dessert. Nose of caramel, alcohol, dried figs and dates, walnut, wood smoke. The palate is full of Christmas spice, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. After 14 years in oak the tannins are super silky. Piercingly high orange peel acidity which gives it a very vibrant feel, but will not be to everyone's taste. Noval's 20 Year Old Tawny is easier to drink, but has less personality. More in comments >>"
18878,1175612,"The 2000  Quinta do Noval Porto Colheita Tawny is superb, showing warm and welcoming notes of caramel, dried fruit, honey, sultana along with a pinch of toast. The mind immediately jumps to pairings like stilton, Roquefort, or dried fruit, though, surprisingly the staff at Noval recommend trying it with fresh carrot, unpeeled. I love the this Port's vibrancy and balance, the palate bright, like a newly minted penny, its brimming over with walnut shells, figs, golden raisins, and spice cake. Just lovely. 20.5% ABV"
18879,1175612,"My favorite colheita from the Quinta so far. So velvety and balanced that you can easily drink many glasses of it. I like the ""dulce de leche"" touch it has now. Gourmand and sophisticated, a fine port to drink now or keep for later. Very good with a creamy vanilla ice cream, banana bread and a drop of tawny on top."
18880,1175612,Clean. Chocolate ripe spice. Hay and toast bread. Soft spice. Warm opulent and full. Complex mid palate. Long finish.
18881,1175612,Light on the nose with a grand bouquet. Very good Porto that sips extremely well. 92/100

18887,1731495,"Wonderful! A Dao with some age. The Portuguese wine mag, Revista de Vinhos, said it was one of the best in 2020. They were spot on! It’s complex with some oak and red fruits and a long finish but it’s not pruney or over cooked like some Alentejo reds can be. There is a lightness of touch even though this is a full bodied red"
18888,1731495,Just the aroma will win you! 
18889,1731495,"Dense purple colour, intense nose of red cherry, licorice, tobacco and vanilla.

18892,1731495,"DÃO I know someone who loves Dão Wines,  and every time I drink a good or great wine from this region I think of her, and how right she is to love Dão Wines... Elegant like a designer  evening  dress,  voluptuous in the fruity register,  dark ruby like  blood spill in a passionate murder and long and lasting acidity,  like the reminder of a unique perfume of love.  GREAT WINE,  what a woman  this Donna  Georgina!"

Bold, complex and concentrated, with a balanced tannic structure, good acidity and great length. Dark rubi color, floral, ripe black fruit, vanilla, dark chocolate, spices, eucalyptus and very well integrated Oak. Full body, polished ripe tannins and a long tasteful finish. Awesome red, still with great aging potential!"

Finish is long and robust, the only thing holding this back is the high 14.5% alcohol, which while works well with a wine like this, comes through just a tad strong. Exceptional stuff nonetheless"
18896,1731495,"Dark ruby, quite intense. A full bodied and elegant wine with a lot of personality. Nose: tobacco leaves, chocolate, cherry jam. Palate: finer tannins than I expected - complex and well structured. Long finish. Needs to breathe a lot. "

18902,76411,"[Quinta de Lemos 3/5] I always like to try Alfrocheiro, it’s a unique, not common grape. Here there was an oak education of 16 months on French barrels of which 30% new.  Mineralic nose with red bell pepper, black cherry, juniper and oak followed by a green palate with nice acidity, very dry tannins, black cherry and licorice. Eight years old but better wait a bit longer still. 3.6"

18904,76411,"Well the Dão at it's best,  you feel the cold winters the hot but wet summers and the granitic soil giving a hard time to the  roots of these wines. It's the rebirthplace of the Touriga Nacional...

18907,76411,"A love child has many names, in this case the grape name is Alfrocheiro , but A.K.A, Pa de Rato, Tinta Bastardinha, Brunal. Susceptible to roth it’s happier in dry climates and Dão is the best one for clean red mono grape bottles. One of our most favorite vineyards has taken on this task and the product is really really cool. Stored for three years in my cellar it it’s the stellar 2011 vintage. Bone dry,deep dark color and finally grinded dusty tannins. Deceivingly plane at first encounter - but give time. "

18928,76440,"This is precisely why I love a good Alentejo red. Hard to stop drinking it. Cherries and blackberries on the nose reflected in the taste with good acidity and lively tannins and oak with liquorice. Not for every food obviously, but glorious with a steak on a summer evening. We have another bottle ..."
18929,76440,"Continuing the Iberian theme, is this sub £15 offering from a producer that’s now cemented its reputation. This wine is a medium-bodied & easy-drinking, but also with a fair amount of grip. An entry level wine but still a great introduction to this style/producer. Dark fruits, medium tannins and acidity. 3.75⭐️ a great midwek quaffer plus. "

18946,5806238,"Wow, what an awesome Douro red. A blend of the very best grapes at Quinta do Vallado. Full bodied with an impressive nose of ripe dark fruit. On the palate, just loaded with jam, black currant, blueberry, oak, chocolate, and vanilla. So complex, with tobacco, leather, and earthy tones leading to an extremely long finish. Enjoyed with a delicious pork cheek dish for dinner at Quinta do Vallado."
18947,5806238,"It has good aromas and flavors of fresh fruit (black fruit / red fruit) and woody. Ruby / violet color, full-bodied, medium-dry. However, in the sensorial dimension it is already a pleasant wine from the Douro region. Alcohol in the level 14.5°, which, for me, is too much for table wine and a less gastronomic aspect. Contains sulfites.  "
18948,5806238,"Good uill body smooth with lots of smell and taste of blackberries oak, vanilla."
18949,5806238,Sabor do Douro. Frutado e encorpado.

Complex notes of blueberry, black raspberry, mint, and tobacco. Polished yet wild wine, it has smoothness on the mid-palate and a wild forrest note on the finish. High acidity and firm tannins."
18953,5806238,"Single plot of old vines, about 100 years old, blending 34 grape varieties - the wine is rich and has a lot of power and nice concentration, it’s a wine to store a bit in the cellar or enjoy now with some nice grilled red meat 🥩😊"
18954,5806238,"Really tasteful and you can he french oak, but needs to be open 1 to 2 hours before drinking it. There are way better wines, way cheaper than this. "
18955,5806238,Fantastic red wine! Smooth and easy to drink

18960,1216909,"Love this beautifully balanced red from Niepoort. Still young, but even so the earth and fruit dance on the palate: dark fruit and red fruit, leather, slight oak, hints of honey and caramel. A touch of spice and tang. At this age the nose lacks a touch of earth, but its nonetheless lovely with spice, red fruit and vanilla. "
18961,1216909,Medium body. Lighter than other reds I have had from Douro. Very very good lengthy and balanced acidity. Keeping the second bottle for a year or two. Got half way through the glass and changed the rating from 4.5 to 5.0  oak cherry leather
18962,1216909,92+/100 Very old vineyards in the Douro. Surprisingly light for a Douro red. Medium to light bodied with lots of red fruit and pepper. It acts like a light handed Syrah. Fantastic texture and fine tannins. Long juicy finish.

18972,1216909,A field blend of old vines at just 13% of alcohol. Very easy on the palate it suffered to be had after Pintas 2015. Anyway Niepoort is a very clever winemaker and this is a very good wine

18974,8967," Appearance : deep ruby in colour  Nose: very expressive nose evoking scents of red and dark fruits , cherries, ripe red berries , blackberries, leather and wood  Palate: dry, full bodied with silky medium tannins and good acidity. Elegant wine and complex.It shows notes of tobacco leaf,ripe cherries, cherries and plum, sweet blackberries,spices, oak "
18975,8967,"I’ve recently rated Niepoort’s Redoma; this is the big brother. 70-100 year old Douro vines from two sites, mostly on north-facing slopes to ensure slow ripening. A field blend, with Touriga Franca the biggest component. Gentle extraction, 20m in French oak, 25% new. It’s similar to the Redoma but with more depth and intensity. Dark berries and gentle oak spice, elegant and mineral. Medium + tannins and acidity. Only 12.5% abv. Remarkably drinkable now, but will of course reward patience."
18976,8967,"Astonishing depth and power for just 12%... Subtle dark fruit and a long finish. Special in its way and I do recommend to try. Pure understatement, enjoyed it big time."

18982,8967,"This bottle was Wine Of The Night. It was really singing. So many layers, so alive and intense. Everyone a the table loved it.   Spice, smoked meat, plums and dark berries. Good structure and has many years left. Smooth finish. Highly recommended! "
18983,8967,"The 2014 Batuta is still young and will improve with age but it is already elegant with a nice long finish, soft balanced tanins and fruit"
18984,8967,"I wanted something special for my birthday/end of the year, this was expected to do well. After noting it reminded me of Bordeaux, I was pleased to read that is definitely Mr. Niepoort’s intention. He doesn’t use foreign grapes though, rather a couple of more exotic local varieties: Rufete and Malvazia Preta complement Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz. In the nose sousbois, plum, prune, blackberry, smoke and raspberry. The palate has pronounced, beautiful acidity, constructive tannines, ... ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️"
18985,8967,"Very intense fruity, plum scent on the nose, beautifully complex, with big velvety tannins. Nose reminds of a port wine, without the sweetness. Great, powerful wine that is very easy to drink."
18986,8967,This is an excellent wine. Good value for money taking it account its quality. Reminds me of a high quality grand cru from Bordeuax 
18987,8967,Clairvoyance Douro. Very mature role dark rich fruits. Sweet. You can taste the sun of Portugal. Mild leather nose. Long.  black fruit plum leather
18988,4498077,"Interesting color! Deep opaque salmon color. Very light aromas of quince, marmalade, apples, sour cherries and cranberries. Medium acidity and tannins. Refreshing crisp finish. "

18990,4498077,"Cranberry, red fruit with earthy and an interesting nose. The color is insane, a murky ruby pomegranate color. Easy to drink without food "
18991,4498077,"very light, very smooth, herbs, woody, metallic, grapefruit, really delicious and balanced "
18992,4498077,"Certainly different. 80% (white) loureiro + 20% (red) vinhão, made in amphora w/o electricity. I hate struggling with pretentious wax capsules. Ugly, hazy cherry-KoolAid coloring. A smoky lemon nose, with maybe bread notes. Not fruity & the vinhao doesn’t add much. Painfully dry, with a strong saline quality. Totally blind, I’d have guessed lemon-water (except for the wine-like viscosity). Serve chilled. Desperately needs food (was better with trout). Worth a try, but not particularly enjoyable. 3.8 woofs."
18993,4498077,"Really cool natural wine. Light and acidic, like an alcoholic citrus water. Would be great midday in the sun. "
18994,4498077,A perfect summer red
18995,4498077,"Fruity and dry, nice light colour. "
18996,4498077,"Cherry, strawberry, limited production of 3333. Tasted fresh, refreshing and fruit driven. A hint of funk and tasted like natural wine.   Organic wine that is produced without electricity and using clay pot and beeswax. "
18997,4498077,"Fantastic wine, only 3,333 made, after trying I immediately went back to the store to get another bottle. Light body, fruity and smooth, the colour is beautiful"
18998,4498077,"Dryer and smoother than I think most other reviews. Nice berry tones, a bit of funkyness! Lots of love all of their wines! Perfect for a lambic beer nerd like me.  Enjoyed after work while cooking 🥘💯"
18999,4498077,"3.9⭐ Pale garnet color.  Funky cherry, strawberry and orange peel nose. Light, refreshing and fun! Tart cherry, cranberry and white spice on the palate.  Medium body and tart acidity with faint tannins.  Very nice for a natural wine! Made in clay Amphorae lined with beeswax and it uses mostly a white grape (Loureiro).  Only 3,333 bottles made.  11% I saw @[1|15545735|Annika F (The F clearly is for Foodie )] have the Rosé yesterday so she influenced me to open this one! No regrets 🍷"
19000,4498077,"This is first time I drink a red wine based mostly on a white grape (Loureiro).  Very pleasant in nose with red berries and orange.  Delicious citrus (blood orange) in mouth and very delightful just to sip as it is or enjoy with a nice summer salad, either with white meat or seafood. "
19001,4498077,"Blend of white Loureiro and red Vinhão grapes - biodynamic and one of the best producer of ta region - fermented in amphoras coated with bee wax - the Vinhao grape as usually a spacious and unique character that we find in the wine - in addition we got a saline notes (from Loureiro I guess) then it has smoky notes, earthy character and light orange perfume (beeswax I guess) and very floral notes - great and original wine "
19002,4498077,"Unfiltered, light and slightly orange tone. Very light on the nose with light berry tones. Very light wine with some bitterness. Rather strange but enjoyable a nice summer evening. Funky wine."
19003,94301,Like! Great with well seasoned beef and rosemary potatoes. Fruitful - blackberry and blackcurrant without a doubt .. still young with decent tannins and good oak - dry long finish. Great example of a Douro Tinto wine. 
19004,94301,"Intense color and vanilla oaky bouquet, bold / complex / smooth taste, higher but acceptable tannins. "

19007,94301,Black fruit mainly
19008,94301,Very good - spicy 
19009,94301,"Yes, menthol at the end!!  "
19010,94301,"Medium to full body,  blackberries, well integrated wood. "
19011,94301,Powerful fruit bomb
19012,94301,Well balanced. Medium
19013,94301,Dry and smooth with a little bit of fruit 
19014,94301,"Dry with cherry, plum and vanilla and long finish"
19015,94301,Quite outstanding. Tried a glass at By the Wine
19016,94301,Deep rich flavor. Very satisfying  
19017,94301,"Was recommended at this winebar in Lisbon, but the first impression with port did not do it any good. Dry and closed. "
19018,1290538,"Just as good as the 2019 vintage. Bold, jammy and fruity, medium + body, balanced tannins. Complex mouth with black fruit, plum, blackberry. Opens to a lovely vanilla and finishes with oak."
19019,1290538,"Something less mainstream in your glass. Deep noble purple, black currant violet baking spices cedar jam oak. High in tannins and acidity, this one is just too young to open. Give it at least 3 more years."
19020,1290538,"An absolute ‘must’ taste red wine from Douro, Portugal. Assemblage of Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz & Tinta Barocca - all hand harvested. The wine is bold & juicy, complex & structured. Aromas of black fruit, ripe bramble, cherry sprinkled with herbs, cocoa beans. The palate meaty with medium tannins & medium + acidity. Long finish.  Drink it now, thank me later💋"
19021,1290538,"Black fruit, smooth tannins, will be better in a year when the alc is less obvious. Nevertheless a great buy at 14.99 in Pingu. "
19022,1290538,"Red & dark fruit( blue berries) power full, need food. But elegant with tannins"
19023,1290538,"A really great Douro red expression of concentrated red and black fruit fruit with minty chocolate tones! Nice full bodied drinker,with loads of flavor and depth!! "
19024,1290538,Typical Duro with plenty of punch and dark black fruit flavours. Long finish and we’ll balanced tannins and acidity. I bought this in Lisbon for 13 euros. Easy drinkable wine at a very reasonable price. 
19025,1290538,"4.0  I am not familiar with wines from Portugal hence this was quite a small voyage of discovery. Deep purple appearance, elegant nose and medium-plus body shows a very nice approach of winemaking. Leather, blackberry, plum, cherry and violet dominate the pattern. The finish hides some smoke and pepper as well. Wonderful. "
19026,1290538,"Notes of barbecue meat, potpourri, and lavender on the nose. Unexpectedly bright! Tangy and tart on the tongue, with flavors of cherry, and some slight oak. Finish is tannic with some cranberry, cedar, and tobacco. Excellent dry, tannic, and complex wine."
19027,1290538,"Deep dark young nuances of purple transitioning to red. The nose is still underdeveloped but it already shows great potential for complex notes of black currant, plum, oak, some liquorish, vegetal and mineral. The mouth is spicy, long and highly acidic. Tannins are already out of the rough zone and showing some interesting grip. It finishes long with a good balance of dryness and sweetness. This wine has lots of potential. "
19028,1290538,"Another beautiful PS release following the sensational 2018. I suspect this can easily grow to 4,5 in the years to come. Very firm, Lots of structure but greatly balanced. Not as fresh and lifted as the 2018 but one of the best releases to keep Maybe "
19029,1290538,"Great wine. Tried it next to the 2017 vintage and found it equally impressive despite its younger age. Impressive deep purple colour . Nose of fresh red cherries chocolate with hints of toast and vanilla. The present but not unbalanced tannins. Plum and cedar , tobacco and espresso "
19030,1290538,"This is already a 4+ wine, so buy some now and lay it down for a few years. This Douro red has lots of personality with dark cherry, black fruit, plum, some pepper spice, a balanced note of oak, a bit of leather and a trace of vanilla. This will be welcome at any table of red fans. "
19031,1290538,"Nice smooth, plum and blackberry flavored wine. A little oak coming through as well. Good wine "
19032,1290538,"Plummy, vanilla, bit of oak. Gorgeous wine."
19033,1142434,"Dry taste, lots of delicate dry raisins with range of scents and tastes (cinnamon? BlackBerry jam?). Nice, very delicate and balanced, ""aristocratic"". By the way, lots of ""wine stone "" at the end, ~40 ml. Very good! "
19034,1142434,Still bright and vibrant for an old bottle. Pours a beautiful deep ruby red. Bright fruity berry notes - distinct strawberry and blackberry with some underlying dried fruit raisin notes. Rich and sweet without being overbearing.
19035,1142434,"Time for dessert 🍰with this #only sixteen# port 2003 Notes of licorice, black berries 🍒 lots of essence, running around the christmas tree🌲and family🎅✔️😉"
19036,1142434,"Deep garnet in colour, lots of orange on the rim.  Pronounced aroma intensity, showing lots of tertiary aromas & some primary.  Prune, black plum, raisin, chocolate, flint, blackberry jam on the nose.  Sweet, medium acid, high tannin, high alcohol, full body, pronounced flavour intensity, long finish.  Prune, black fruit, jam, raisin on the palate.  Outstanding port, my first vintage port example and it’s drinking beautifully now.  Can continue to age and will be even better.  4/5"
19037,1142434,Very good Port from a Quinta I hope to visit in 2020. Almost as good as Delaforce Corte vintage 1995 and 1997
19038,1142434,"Fantastic port, love it!"
19039,1142434,"Vintage 2003 opened in 2019. 👀The color is deep ruby. 👃The nose is offering raisins, fig and plum. 👅The palate is offering alcohol, plum, fig and raisins. Not in balance, to much alcohol.  I rate it 6 out of 10 points. "
19040,1142434,Really good deep tobacco taste.   Little bit goes a long way.  
19041,1142434,Needs more time still
19042,1142434,Tried this at Red's in Toronto $11 shot
19043,1142434,"Fruity, sweet, simply lovely!! "
19044,1142434,"Very good. Dark color. Violet and other floral aromas. Not as sweet as others, has a slight menthol taste and good alcohol. Nice mid-range VP. "
19045,1142434,Vivino Offline at Oso Ristorante finale  Theme: something with '7'  1975 port! Beautiful finale!  Brick colour.  Velvety smoothness! Showing some age but in a elegant way.  Really enjoyable. Thanks a lot See Wee!  This was WOTN for me.  Fun evening with a few curve balls in the blind tasting! Great to see some of the 'old' Singapore Vivino people again. 🍷🍷
19046,1142434,Best port I have tasted. I prefer Ruby over tawny and this port definitely settle why that is. So much character and taste. I love it .
19047,1142434,So so great. Balance and long structure. So happy I have some bottle left.  blackberry cherry cedar chocolate raisin fig
19048,1924936,"Brown in colour, not surprisingly. All cooked fruit, jammy, raisins and nut flavour. Excellent aperitif!"
19049,1924936,Wonderful. Tom Jane Maria Jonny Noel Rosie 
19050,1924936,"Nice port but did not age quite as well as expected. I’d had this 25 years ago and it was pretty good, but has a lot more wrinkles and gray hair than I’d have thought it should. Not certain if it’s just this bottle. "
19051,1924936,"Very fine and well balanced. Lots of legs in glass and colour is still quite dark.  Bags of fruit balanced with acidity. Will continue to,age well but I think very good now."
19052,1924936,"35 years and still a great wine. That's awesome. Raisins, nuts, fig, mint.. and it never ends... "
19053,1924936,Drinking very well now
19054,1924936,"Surprisingly vibrant and""young"" given its age.  Nice and vibrant."
19055,1924936,Fantastic port wine. 
19056,1924936,"Partial note. Very smooth and in a nice spot for drinking now. Dried red cherries, leather, dried herbs. Smooth tannins; med body. "
19057,1924936,Not a big port fan but this definitely aged nicely
19058,1924936,"Extremely nice. Smooth, creamy, medium(+) acidity, high alcohol, long finish.  chocolate clove tobacco"
19059,1924936,"4.6 Beautiful well aged port from this less known winery. Rusty red color that is a bit lighter than one would see mostly with vintage ports. Lovely notes of dried fruits, herbs, chocolate with a lot of depth and lingering complexity. After being open for a few ours more leathery and oaky notes come forward and the port becomes a bit more drying. Really good. If you own a bottle: this ready to be enjoyed. "
19060,1924936,"Very light and elegant nose of decaying cherries, black currant and loads of dried herbs, especially mint. Very fresh. Sweet and medium bodied with great acidic reserve and really good structure. It is well preserved and should drink well for decades to come. This must have been an absolute blockbuster monster on release. Really surprisingly good. 96p"
19061,1924936,"Top gun 🔫. A complex nose of dried candied fruits and dark fruits. On the palate tasted dark chocolate 🍫,herbal, blackcurrant and finish is on the sweet side. Tannins are mellowing down. Medium long finishing. Well rounded flavors. Lovely experience."
19062,1924936,"95/100 We sampled this during the tasting of the 2016 vintage declaration celebration. Round red fruit, chocolate, citrus, and dried herbs. Supple tannins and huge mouthfeel make this enjoyable now. Long finish. "
19063,1639509,"Well structured, balanced and smooth. One of the wines which had helped to improve the reputation of wines from the Dao region. "
19064,1639509,"Smooth, balanced and elegant. The right amount of forrest fruit, acidity and oak makes it a prefect wine to accompanion dark meat dishes. The best value for the money. "
19065,1639509,Cor escura . Intenso mas com suavidade no paladar . Cheiro a frutos vermelhos e especiarias .  Dark. Intense with smoothness in the mouth . Red fruits and spices 
19066,1639509,"On the nose red berries, plum, herbs, earth, medium fruit forward palate, red cherries, blackcurrant, ripe tannin and smooth acidity for balance. Ready to drink. 87 DSP"
19067,1639509,"Aromas of chocolate, plum, blackberry, cedar, black cherry. Good firm body with long lasting finish. Hard to get over how the finish reminds me of dark chocolate covered strawberries."
19068,1639509,A bit of a revelation and absolute bargain from Lidl. Beautiful colour and nose. Lovely fruit. Medium/full body. Smooth with a little sharpness. Really punching above it’s weight 
19069,1639509,"Garnet colour. Slighly smoky, a bit of sourdough, red fruit on the nose. Dry, medium body, medium/high acid, high tannin. Gentle smokiness hits the mouth amongst notes of old leather. Smooth mouth feel although tannins end a bit clunky. Vanilla notes on the finish. Young blackberries seem to be prominent fruit so begs for the right pairing. The value in this label is known though, and this continues that tradition at under $20 CAD (at Kits Wine Cellar, Vancouver, BC.) "
19070,1639509,"A little more south in Portugal, inland is the Dao area, another hotspot for great value wines imho.  Interesting impressions of coffee beans, blue berrries, med acidity and tannins. Balanced and a nice sophisticated bitter on the tongue. Good. 14 pts"
19071,1639509,"Solid value wine. Light, versatile, very drinkable on its own. Cherry & spice, pairs well with beef. "
19072,1639509,"Nice red Portuguese wine.  Goes very well with bbq ribs.  Black cherry taste, with a soft finish.  Very nice"
19073,1639509,"Fruity aroma of plums and cherries, lightly spiced with grippy  tannins "
19074,1639509,"This is a good one, from Costco 6.89. Firm tannin, very rounded and silky mouthfeel, it's a steal for that price. I'm going back to get more."
19075,1639509,Once it's breathed a lovely smooth and silky wine. Rich in fruit and spice
19076,1639509,"Restaurante italiano ""italiano republic"""
19077,1639509,Balanced and beautiful. Really starting to love Portuguese wine. 92
19078,88352,"Mouth filling with lovely black and plum flavours, beautifully balanced with dark chocolate on the after taste, very stylish 🍷"
19079,88352,"Stunning vintage port. Such a pleasure to drink and a beautiful balanced wine with lovely primary fruit.. black currant, plum and some raisin developing. Lovely dry finish."
19080,88352,"Covid19🔒⤵️ week 3. Very dark, dense ruby red with unctious nose of prune, fig, raisin, dried fruits, bright red fruits, vanilla & some spirit. Not overly sweet, mouthfilling & silky smooth. Lots of red & dried fruit with chocolate, liquorice  & Xmas spice. Massively long and unctious and leaves a fine spice footprint at the back of the throat which lasts forever. Matched with a superb cheeseboard & Mrs S's fig salami in the garden. 🎶listening to ELO - Mr Blue Sky  & George Ezra - Wanted on Voyage 4.4⭐ "
19081,88352,"Dark ruby in colour. Tobacco, mazarin cake, dates, prunes, dried cherries and cranberries, figs and raisins in the aroma. Flavour of tobacco, toasted almonds, cranberries, vanilla, raisins, and dates. 93."
19082,88352,"Taylor’s king of port! Beautiful rich port you want at Christmas, and any other day of the winter and autumn (maybe als on a chilly spring or summer day). Dried fruits, chocolate, give it to me baby!!"
19083,88352,"I've been seeking out more Taylor's port recently, and this is another 👍. It's very fruity, black cherry and blackberry, with violet and liquorice. The palate is lovely and vibrant, nicely balanced, with some dried fruit and dark chocolate. Starting to develop more savoury notes, tobacco, spice. Brilliant value in the UK, where it can comfortably be found for around £25/bottle. Should drink well for another 10 years. "
19084,88352,"91 (92) Aroma had black currants, vanilla, prunes, raisins, sweet dates, cocoa and vanilla. Over the palate came cnadied cherries, sweet black currants, cigar box, sweet dates, chocolate, raisins and prunes. Medium acidity, low tannins and dry."
19085,88352,"This is a excellent port. Good clean taste of plum, oak and that great thing port can. Best price at nielsenogvin.dk"
19086,88352,"Very dark, soft and mature. Great cassis and mocha and crushed black cherries on the palate. Lovely intense finish. Great value for money!"
19087,88352,"Rich, lush, nice, not overtly sweet. Really nice lingering tannins. Close to 5 stars."
19088,88352,Very intense fig honey dark chocolate and still a bit of acidity to balance 
19089,88352,Super til pepperkake og stilton.
19090,88352,"Strong blackcurrant and blackberry, slight menthol from alcohol, touch of vanilla. "
19091,88352,Great port. All the best of red wine with the best of port. Dark sweet berries concentrated with a nice alcohol and eucalyptus balance. Lots of depth and a long finish.
19092,88352,"Nose: Cherry, Vanilla, Red Wine, Cracked Pepper, Spicy, floral   Palate: Thick Spice, Sweet Finish, Tart, Smokey, Strawberry "
19093,1748188,More robust than the previous harvests I had. Some hints of licorice in this year. Poor pairing with fish so bit upset I went for the democratic choice for red. Never listen to your table mates...
19094,1748188,"This is a much nicer red than the previous ones we’ve experimented with this summer. A nice deep red colour with an intriguing bouquet which I cannot decipher! Slightly more acidic than I would like on first tasting, however it goes down pleasingly and now we have some nice flatbread and cheese on the go this is ticking more and more boxes. I could be swayed to go to 4 stars, but for now this is a reliable red which I would buy again without hesitation."
19095,1748188,"Long wine home X.  In fact we're really taking a long way home. Too long as I see it. Dwelling in Toledo with the girls, Laura and Lurdes, we had a lot of Tempranillo. Still, got on the last train West. And arrived in deep Alentejo.  Finally, a Red piece of paradise.  Alicante Bouschet-Top Trincadeira-Required Aragonez, aka Tempranillo-Soft Syrah-just an Extra.  From a deep full breath to a full fruity bodied space: One of the coolest genuine local Red blends that I have come across with.  Missed it. A lot."
19096,1748188,Really nice easy drinking wine 
19097,1748188,"A little bit sharp, but nevertheless a good Alentejo wine."
19098,1748188,Good red wine
19099,1748188,Fruity sharp in the end gets better with fish
19100,1748188,Smooth but lacks body. Quaffable. 
19101,1748188,"Final longo, demasiado forte ."
19102,1748188,Nice soft full body
19103,1748188,"Nicely bodied, good for any codfish or meat meal."
19104,1748188,"Mais um degustado durante minha viagem a Portugal. Cor granada, ao nariz, aroma de fruta vermelha, alguns aromas de flores, em boca, corpo médio, taninos equilibrados, final longo. 🍷 Another one tasted during my trip to Portugal.  Garnet color, to the nose, red fruit aroma, some flower aromas, in mouth, medium body, balanced tannins, long finish."
19105,1748188,"Lot of fruit jam, bit harsh. Simple."
19106,1748188,"Typical Alentejo red, nice blend, but nothing extra ordinary."
19107,1748188,"Half bodied Alentejo , smoth round taste , short finish , some fruits , ok for this price . "
19108,33324,"Good price, good value, getting better with years passing, a very pleasing port with spicy character but good get more depth "
19109,33324,"Really nice port, red/brownish on the eye, figs and plums on the nose, very smooth and silky soft, sweet, touch of caramel on the palate."
19110,33324,"Figs and wet plums on the nose. Smooth yet spicy in the mouth. Quite clean, drinks well now but I am sure this will age well."
19111,33324,"Delicious ripe port with plums and all sorts of dried dark fruit on nose and palate, but with a obvious spicy touch. Mature taste but still very fresh. Amazing with fine dark chocolate and 6-years parmigiano."
19112,33324,"An absolute pleasure to drink. Fruity with raisins, cigar box and tobacco. It still had a slight Banyuls to the taste but I'm guessing another couple of years that will have worked itself out of the wine. Didn't bother me at all, though. A must try!"
19113,33324,"Another outstanding, very fruity and elegant vintage port that I drank last year. Wine Spectator = 92 points."
19114,33324,"Complex and layered with a long finish, black cherry, licorice. Even Better the next day, this still got some time. "
19115,33324,Excellent after steak
19116,33324,"Very tasty Port. Soft, delicious and elegant, full symphonic orchestra. Raisins, plums, chocolate and caramel. Perfect for cheese."
19117,33324,Ripe red fruit and alcohol on the nose. Sweetness up front that changes to over ripe blackberry. A little green on the finish.
19118,33324,Alco. DB. Sweet dreams.
19119,33324,"Black fruits, concentrated, rich, Long aftertaste, dry!"
19120,33324,"Medium ruby centre with a brick red rim. Dried red fruit and wood stain on the nose. Medium (-) acidity and sweet, Baking spice, cinnamon, molasses and raisins on the complex palate.   This is only the second Port I've tried. I really enjoy the tertiary (age) characteristics that resemble that of an aged warm climate table wine."
19121,33324,"Smells like candy (Mon Cherry) and light wood. Soft and rich like sirup and balanced, hints of medicine. 3 days after opening softness and ballance is gone."
19122,33324,"Quite disappointing considering its accolades and ratings. A sharp bitterness lingers on the palate, with cinnamon sugar, brown sugar and spice."
19123,83732,"Huge and dark, needs time to breathe. Quite tannic with incredible length. I think this has years to go."
19124,83732,"93 bold and full bodied. Not complxed enough. WS 95, RP 91"
19125,83732,Delish dessert wine! High amount of sediment.
19126,83732,Ripe fruits chocolate tobacco fresh. Love it 
19127,83732,"95/100 From the 2016 Port Vintage declaration tasting. One of the most tannic and structured wine from the vintage, it's built to last. Notes of strawberry rhubarb, cherry, and mocha notes. More on the red fruit spectrum. This is going to be one long lasting wine. "
19128,83732,"Sourced from the Douro Superior & Cima Corgo, a trad field blend trodden in lagares, over-wintered in oak vats at Qta da Gricha & then aged in inox at Vila Nova de Gaia.  Deep ruby. M+ aroma intensity, very ripe & redolent of dark jammy black fruit. Cassis, blackberry, crème de mure, raisin & prune. Youthful w. black cherry coulis & dark chocolate.  Sweet. Rich w. lifted violet. Prune, raisin, crème de mure/cassis & blackberry. High alc, full body, high fine-grained tannins & a spicy long finish w. cocoa."
19129,83732,"A beautiful example of what this producer can do. Rich and full bodied, good tannin structure and some complexity. A wonderful port that should continue to age nicely for years to come."
19130,83732,"Big fruit forward port with excellent depth and balance - huge plums, blackberries, chocolate, cinnamon and tobacco - Churchill Graham Ltd. is always to be respected - and this great example lived up to the tradition of high standard - well worth grabbing any  vintage from this producer! 😃😜🍷"
19131,83732,"Rusty purple and a little sediment.   Raisins, cherries and brown sugar.   Sweet and tart are beautifully balance. I really am loving churchills light style of port.   A clear finish, a very warm flavor. Lovely 😊 "
19132,83732,"Churchill declared in a rainy, off year.....and hit it out of the park. Grapes were picked before the rain and were intense flavors and aromas "
19133,83732,"Incredible vibrant and energised port. Powerful fruit and tannins, the acidity sings on the finish. A long life ahead of it. Beautiful stuff"
19134,83732,95pts me  The next vintage after 94 that was a big success is 97 and it shows in the half bottle of 97   Roasted anise liqurice mulberrieses liqour and smooth peppery sense of vanilla and mineral over cinnamon   Soft ripe wine like a pillow that richly flavored and some sandlewood on the side  Quite dense with balanced high acidity and a complex finish What can I say :)
19135,83732,2003 vintage.  Very strong presence of fruit. Long finish. One of the best ever.  I would pair with red meat. 
19136,83732,"Peppery aromas, with lots of crushed berries. Medium- to full-bodied, with light sweetness and a soft, round tannic structure. Not on the same level as the fabulous 2000. "
19137,83732,"Wow, what a wine!  Dark colour, rich fruit. Sweet, red berries. Chocolate, plums, nuts."
19138,1175612,"This is a great port, vibrant and delicious, and for me half a star better than Noval’s Colheita 2000.  My notes said “drink and celebrate life!”.    Light tawny colour.  Nose of caramel, orange, fruitcake, walnut and wood smoke. The palate is quite developed, very silky, with clove, cinnamon and nutmeg spice. High acidity, but not as high as the 2000 vintage.  Superb! "
19139,1175612,"Appearance: beautiful brunt Amber  Palate: wonderful sweet with a subtle dryness up front. Leaves you wanting another sip. Nose: hints of rhubarb, cherry, and oak.   "
19140,1175612,I was not sure on the first mouthful but after a few more sips fell in love with this single vintage tawny port. A definite winner. 
19141,1175612,"Wine is clear, brightness is bright, deep garnett color, edge is pale ember color, no gas, no sediment viscosity is high. Aroma is clean, dried red current, dried mango, dried pineapple, dried red berry, alcohol, petrol, mineral aroma. Sweet, full body, oily body texture, medium + acidity, medium tannin, high alcohol, medium+ finish, complexity is moderate."
19142,1175612,"Nail polish and pecan nuts nose. Salted caramel chocolate and Seville maramalade palate. Strong alcohol (21%) leads to a nutty finish that goes on and on. I prefer ruby port but this is great, moreish and I would buy again.  "
19143,1175612,"Bottled in 2018. Very beautiful nose. Very nutty, caramel, toffee, vanilla, dried fig, tobacco, almond, leather, ginger. Bold and strong (21%abv, and 2003 was a warm season indeed), creamy, honey, sweet, dark chocolate. Long finish with chocolate hints. Very good Port 👍."
19144,1175612,Tobacco spice smooth finish
19145,1175612,"Almond, black fruits, brown sugar. Great finish, very toasty"
19146,1175612,Noval. I love you. 👍❤️🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷
19147,1175612,"Caramel, orange marmalade, slight nutty flavor "
19148,1175612,"12 years aging in bottle, this superb port is just released. Exceptional vintage. "
19149,1175612,Intense nose. Caramel and cooked oranges. Dried figs and nuts up front. Nice long complex finish with layers. This nutty finish is balanced well with a great acidity. 
19150,1175612,"Caramel, orange marmalade, fruitcake, walnut, ground cocoa, and some dustiness. This port had a lot going on with it and everyone else at the table seemed to appreciate that as well. It didn’t quite have the viscosity or richness I was expecting from Noval though, so not quite the perfect wine. But a great one to serve after a night spent tasting lots of different wines and wanting to end on a high note."
19151,1175612,"18/20. Still fresh and fruity. Berries,cherry, drugstore, fruits, vanilla, wood, caramel, nuts. Extremely balanced on the palate. Tannins, sweetness, bitterness and acidity are in harmony. Highly recommended."
19152,1175612,"Tawny colour, amazing aromas of rose tree syrup, prune, cherry jam, chocolate. Mellow, elegant palate. "
19153,76409,"Lots of plum and red fruit on the nose, full body with distinct tannins and some acidity. Interesting blend, it takes a bit to uncover it."
19154,76409,Excellent medium body with red berries and a good amount of tannins.  Will sip well on it's own or pair beautifully with any red meat. 
19155,76409,"It's a 100% Pinot Noir from Douro region, north Portugal. Very delicate wine, strict style, 14% alc, rich nose with the earth, oak, leather, fruits, soft tannins on palate, 3.9 "
19156,76409,"4.0 In the nose oak licorice cherries and light vanilla.  Silky wine and very tasty.  I suspect it might go great with red meat but i drunk it alone.  Well built, noticeable tannins, good acidity and lot of fruit.  Finish not too long.  Decent wine."
19157,76409,"A very good wine, but the alcohol is a bit too dominant. Medium purple. In the nose, medium intensity with plum, blackberry, blueberry, figs, vanilla, lilac. On the palate, medium intensity with cherry, blueberry, vanilla, tobacco, smoke. High alcohol, high acidity, medium-plus tannins, full body, bone dry. Very nice pairing to Comte cheese."
19158,76409,"Loved this, definitely making a visit to the Duoro region when travel feasible again  Lovely dark ruby colour all the way  out to the edges  Nose of black fruit, earthy, blackberry with bramble and some oak (not much though)  In mouth plum jam, lovely loooong finish and worked a treat with Irish stew on Day 1 and my world famous creamy carbonara on Day 2 (when it hadn’t lost anything)"
19159,76409,The fruit is cherry. Very little earth. It is dry and a little tannic. Not too acidic. Great for an American palate. 
19160,76409,"Very nice medium body red wine. Light in color, the wine has notes of cherry and chocolate with a medium length finish."

19179,8998,"This makes up for last night's Portuguese wine disaster, and is not only the best Portuguese white I've had, but one of the best whites I've had in recent memory.  Awesome nose of white peach, Asian pear, dried herb and mineral, bitter nut and wet slate.  An alluring nose leads to a sumptuous palate, even in youth. Zesty citrus, line and grapefruit with tangy tropics and juicy pear & peach. Almost buttery, poached pear hints, mineral & lime peel to finish.  Very mineral, saline dryness. Stunning."
19180,8998,"Oustanding portuguese white wine. Limpid yellow color. Enchanting nose with pineapple and mellon wrapped in floral notes and subtile smoked ending. In mouth, good body and acidity in perfect harmony. Fresh and creamy structure delivering ellegant citric fruit flavors with butter and smoke notes. Long lasting offering a great aftertaste with a subtile and unexpectedly pleasant pepper finish. Great wine pairing wonderfully with codfish. Cheers!"
19181,8998,"By far the best white wine i had. Soft, Light and super flavoured, loved it. Citrus, honey, orange, lime!"
19182,8998,"Dry wine from fortified region. Good combo of riper fruit and high acid. Complex, without being heavy"
19183,1484920,Perfectly pleasant but nothing all that interesting.
19184,1484920,"Excellent. Rich in nose (twist it), like green apples, pears, watermelon, all them very sweet. In mouth, some long sourness makes it go well with food (Shrimp in this case). Great."

19225,1126475,"I agree with team Vivino, close enough to 4.5 stars and some years of patience will only make that more indisputable. Don’t know what picking in moonlight brings to a wine but whatever, this is quality! And a demonstration of the possibilities of Alicante-Bouchet.  Perfume nose with vanilla, red & black cherry, oak and prune followed by an exuberant palate with perfect acidity, pronounced, spicy tannins, black currant and generous finish. Very young but oh so promising! 4.3  "
19226,1126475,Very elegant nose of vanilla dark fruit and oak. In the beginning cigar box but not unpleasant at all. Long finish and perfectly integrated acidity. Silky but gripping tannins. Can’t ask for much more than this.

19248,1212844,"Always a pleasure, on these warm summer days, to have friends over for dinner, who bring good wines you haven't tasted before. This Portuguese red blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira, Touriga Nacional and a few others, is the quintessential summer evening wine: great with barbecues and - in our case - chili con carne. In spite of its tannic grip and 14% alcohol, it has a lighter, more cheerful side, with tart fruit and a peppery, spicy, savoury touch to lift the layers of coffee, bitter chocolate and oak spices."
19249,1212844,"Caramel, dried prunes, good acidity. Cheers "

In the mouth wich is pretty complex, a lot of ripe red fruit with solid tannins that provide structure and a long, harmonious aftertaste countered through a solid acidity in which the ripening flavors are released. 4.1🌟"
19363,2242915,"This wine is a clear deep ruby.  The nose is clean with med intensity. Aromas of blackberry, black plum, vanilla, clove, tobacco & chocolate.  The palate is med sweet with med + acidity and med alcohol. The tannins med - and quite smooth. It has a med + body and a long finish. It has med intensity that follows from the nose.  Very good quality wine. This wine is good, it’s mot too sweet & the acidity prevents it being cloying at all. Drinking now but needs time to show its best."

19374,1203034,Tasting of two vintages: First up is vintage 2000. Very good and well balanced. Powerful fruit. Never ending finish. Very smooth and complex.  Great vintage.
19375,1203034,Very good. And the best is  I have still 12 bottles in the cellar
19376,1203034,Bing bang boom. great vintage. phenomenal port. decanted for 6 hours before it really opened up
19377,1203034,"Fruity and smooth with deep flavors of prunes, chocolate, clove, raisins, blackberries, wood, toast, and about a hundred other things. I wish I could drink this forever. It was 19 years old when I opened it. "
19378,1203034,What a way to finish a meal - Gorgonzola and port. Nice ruby port well balanced and lightened by age
19379,1203034,Stands the test of time. Excellent!!

19382,1203034,"En god port vin, men kanskje ligget litt for lenge?? Vanskelig å si men noe minner om at den burde blitt drukket før. Black cherry, slightly pepper, prune, raisins, leather,  Starting to get more nutty flavors then I like in a vintage port."
19383,1203034,A fine vintage. Rich on sugar and fruit.
19384,1203034,This was fantastic.
19385,1203034,"Superb. Steven Spurrier very kindly brought this up from his cellar for a tasting in the village hall. Despite 42 years of development, the colour was intense, the nose fresh and the taste full of youthful expression. Amazing. "
19386,1203034,"92/100 Still so young with a lot of life ahead of it. The aging notes are minimal. There are notes of dark cherry, tobacco, spice, and pepper. Time has rounded out this wine and made it elegant. Tannins are developed and the finish has a citrusy note. Beautiful wine. "
19387,1203034,"Vivino needs more vintage port! £60 buys a bottle like this, beautifully aged, shockingly underpriced, a fragment of history waiting to be uncorked. Few wine styles offer so much pleasure for the money.  Nose of maraschino cherry, leather, chocolate, date and spice. The palate is serious and spirity, intense, still with plenty of fruit. Liquorice & stone, nutmeg & cinnamon. Presence and character. One of the ports of a muscular, long-lived vintage. A top companion for a lockdown weekend."
19388,1203034,"Very nice vanilla depth, rounded dried fruit, chocolate and sloe. Has to breathe - this bottle has been opened for 30 days :)"

19394,80415,Very elegant for 51yrs old 
19395,80415,"Fully mature Vintage port, that's hinting towards the end, but luckily I opened it just at the right time. Mine had not always been kept at correct temperature and the cork was basically done for. Managed to save some of it.  Light golden brown. Dried fruit, ethanol and nuts on the nose.  Creamy mouthfeel, with a nice balance between tannins/acidity.   Dried fruit, floral honey and roasted nuts on the palate. Great."
19396,80415,"Complex nose, rosemary and medicinal touch; leathery; Palate is intriguing, full bodied, layered with  dried fruits, plums and cherries,  chocolate & tobacco; still feels quite fresh; long finish of tobacco & chocolate. Quite mellowed with aged but beautifully constructed. 93"
19397,80415,"My only complaint was that there was not another bottle of this. It’s showing a vibrant rim, starting to get to a brick colour, but showing youth even at this age. It has a power that’s eye watering. Lovely. "
19398,80415,My label looks  more authentic... ?  This is terrific stuff.  Still dark and fresh with sweet aromas of candy and nuts and a long rich taste and finish up and down the pallet .  Opened a few weeks ago with friends and finished tonight.  Nothing else like it!
19399,80415,"Very nice, getting a little older by color, but tastes still very fruity"
19400,80415,Dark soft dry excellent after taste. A really good bottle of port. Decanted and stayed fresh with good power until the end. 
19401,80415,"Ruby red, silky smooth and a delectable slight sweetness. Very drinkable and of course supreme with a new year cheeseboard "

19406,1216909,A field blend of old vines at just 13% of alcohol. Very easy on the palate it suffered to be had after Pintas 2015. Anyway Niepoort is a very clever winemaker and this is a very good wine
19407,1216909,"Portuguese wine 🍷 night, and another Charming wine, all in finesse brought to us by @[1|3981616|Omar Daouk] !!

19408,1216909,"Full of shadows that will come to light with time. Dazzling nose of flowers, powdered rock, burnt red bell pepper, clay and dark plum. Soft yet chewy palate of filet mignon, burnt earth, licorice, old wood, iron, granite, glossy soursweet cherry and black tea leaves. Framed in grippy tannins and bright acidity. Lovely finesse. You want it darker, but a line of brightness lightens the palate.   From the heart of the Douro Valley - one of the most stirring regions in the world for quality and character today."
19409,1216909,Pinot like qualities. Beautiful nose filled with ref vibrant fruit. Medium to long finish. Stunner of a bottle.

19414,1216909,"Great Wines of the World - Seoul 2019 by James Suckling, - last batch.  The man (Dirk van der Niepoort) and winery that arguably put Portugal on the quality wine's map. "
19415,1216909,"Unusually long list of grape varieties, indigenious and international. Great balance, beatiful portugese wine, which you will enjoy with beef and seafood. Top quality wine."
19416,1216909,"Niepoort is a Portuguese well known winemaker since 1842. This one tastes like a burgundy one  Made of tinta Roriz, Touriga National and other grapes (not mentioned)  Ruby color, some rustic notes, light cherry taste, light body, elegant   13% "
19417,1216909,"Pale ruby color. Raspberry, red currant, red cherry, leather, and potting soil nose. Dry. High acidity. Medium (+) tannins.

19418,1216909,"Super weird AND spectacular. Sweet, cherry, licorice, fudge vanilla on the nose - never smelled anything like it. Cherry coke! Rose petals? Do all Douro wines smell this weird? Not too heavy. Had it with beef."
19419,8976,"Light spicy aromas, subtle oak & stewed fruit on the nose... on the palate you get soft tasting flavours of cherry bakewell leading to a finish with low acidity & good tannins"
19420,8976,"Very elegant and full of identity. Mineral, fresh, deliciously balanced. Very well made. Not very rich or concentrated but with sufficient acidity to age... Will be interesting to follow. "
19421,8976,"Medium bold, ruby red. Oak, dark berries and something that resembles smoke on the nose. More dark fruit like blackberry an blackcurrant on the pallet. There is also quite a lot of cherry, and some blueberry in the back. Quite a lot of tannins, so it was best with food (lovely with moose). "
19422,8976,"Brilliant wine and good value for money! Almost like a lite version of a Port. That said it's from the fabulous producer Niepoort. On the nose it's rich vanilla, sweeteness and barell. Taste of dark fruits, liquorice and chocolate, with velvety tannins and nice structure. Bargain!"
19423,8976,"Another great product of niepoort. This blend of tinta roriz and touriga franca was elevated for 20m in fr vat. Liquorice, black fruit. Soft creamy texture with present bit integrated tannins. 15,5/20"

19431,8976,Thanks god Douro exists!!!
19432,8976,"Last bottle being tasted tonight, this wonderful Douro. Dark ruby red color. Nice finish"
19433,8976,"CHICAGO WINE #1  At City Winery with Robbie, a place we stubbled on after the Bulls game. The lined up blind flights, and then we decided it was time for a full glass haha! Robbie went white & I went red, opting for Portugal. A mix of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franc & Tinta Amarela, this definitely need age but shows where it's going.  Mainly black fruits on both nose & palate, it also has the vibrant acid & white pepper spice of youth. Heavy body with decent balance, this will shine in another 3-5 years."
19434,1142829,"Medium ruby in color with a developing medium intensity nose. Red currant, plum, black cherry, chocolate, toffee, raspberry. Sweet, medium plus acidity, medium tannins, medium plus body, high alcohol and medium plus intensity on the body. Rich chocolate and cherry notes. Fig, raisin, plum, black cherry, vanilla, almond.

19437,1142829,"9 Decades of Port tasting on Cunard with George Sandeman & Luis Sottomayor. According to George Sandeman ""A vintage to go down in history"". Bottled a few weeks ago. Deep incredibly dark purple. Nose of smoky vanilla & aromatic black fruit. Full bodied, quite high acidity & big tannins. Very spicy on the palate with lots of dark fruit. Medium+ hot spicy finish. Very young & powerful. Should age beautifully. 3.8⭐now, 4.5+⭐potential."
19438,1142829,Too much acidity for my taste.
19439,1142829,"Good wine but it still needs some time to evolve. In the nose it’s a bit reduced but I’m the mouth you get pepper, chocolate, vanilla, taninos. "
19440,1142829,Will be great. Just not ready yet. 10 years away at least. 
19441,1142829,there's an underlying rich exotic fruitiness to this muted nose with lots of acidity which doesn't detract from a well balanced spicy and complete palate and a finish that just keeps going on.
19442,1142829,"Mature vintage port. Pale tawny. Exciting bouquet, tobacco, leather, cinnamon, kirsch, mushroom. Pure on the palate, with 1982's softness and sweetness. Prune, cherry, milk chocolate, cedar. Quite a lot of acidity. Still has a good backbone in this forward year. This is lovely, must be one of the best ports of the vintage. Many producers declared '83 instead of '82. Well done to Sandeman. Historic and healing."
19443,1142829,"Plums, prunes, figs, marzipan. A tad sweet, but balanced with alcohol - ending up in a smooth long finish. Perfect with the blue cheese."
19444,1142829,"Quite anonymous in the nose, but the taste is amazing. Still young and with some power, velvet aftertaste - smooth and long, some sweetness"

19448,1142829,"4.5 92p. Medium tawny colour with a red hue. Slightly more translucent than expected. Beautiful complex nose with sweet, dried fruit (raisins, prunes, burnt figs), walnuts,sweet tobacco, dark chocolate, some sweet alcohol and a whiff of oak. Very nice palate with sour cherries, cherry stone, black pepper and wood. Surprisingly powerful. Strong, nice tannins, and a lingering finish with sweet cherries, a refreshing acidity and oak. Well balanced.  11-"
19449,13303,Fortified wine class. Smokey cherry and chocolate. Attack is very sweet but let it hang out for bit. The tannins are gorgeous. Great finish.

19455,13303,"92pts me (I forgot to take pic)  The 05 is quite good and somewhat ready to drink   Nose is minty, vegetal, floral, peppery on dark berries violet and star anise with hints of dark chocolate.   Quite a heavy tannin still but ripe and focused. Powerful long minty finish with more vegetal component than other vintage port but overall quite good"
19456,13303,"92 Aroma had figs, raisins, dark cherries, dates and coffee. Flavor raisins, figs, dates, plums and chocolate. Medium acid and sweet."
19457,13303,"4.4...  Wow, it’s so young and elegant. Chocolate, red fruit, leather, and mud. Full and rich with smooth tannins. Citrus and long finish. "
19458,13303,"Absolutely breathtaking.  Only had 1 Ramos previously, but this one is a winner.  Great dessert pairing with 3 sorbet's. (Cherry, prickly pear and mango)  Deep garnet color throughout with thin legs.  Great palate of stewed plum, figs, raisin and fresh rain.  Top dessert port....enjoy!"
19459,13303,Nice purple colour turning into red. Intensive forest fruits. Probably good with medium strong cheese.
19460,13303,"Super concentrated red fruit, raisins, berry jam, vanilla, oak. Viscous wine with plenty of alcohol. It needed a little more acidity in order to become perfect. "
19461,13303,"3,9⭐️ 2005 Vintage Port, Ramos Pinto  Intense dark ruby colour Rather closed in the nose, unspecified dark fruit, brown and red laquer. On the palate intense fruit with blackberries, boysenberry jam, raisin, pebber, leather and tobacco  A good concentration of fruit, some tannins, good acidity and a rather long, complex and masculine aftertaste."
19462,13303,"One of the highlights of an excellent day in Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Tasted at Ramos Pinto. They were bought by Roederer in 1990, and now have a slick visitor centre on the Gaia waterfront.  Tawny rim, still deeply coloured in the centre of the glass. Gorgeous aroma, mostly tertiary, leather, chocolate, beef stock, tobacco, dark caramel. There’s just a bit of raisin and prune fruit, this is rather mature. Very sweet. Molasses, vanilla, delicately spiced. Silky smooth and very long. Great... drink up! "
19463,13303,"Much too young. Very complex and dense flavors of nuts, raisins, toffee, orange blossom and zest, rich red and black fruits. Medium tannins, good acidity. Endless finish. Give it another 5 years at least. (93 P)"
19464,1206377,"Drinking beautifully right now. Subtle spices, dried herb & tobacco. Plum & prune compote, shored up with crunchy tannins & bright lemony acids.  Terrific poise & a fine finish."
19465,1206377,"Delicious mature port, a big treat to try this.  Still plenty of dried fruit character, medicinal, with chocolate and spice.  Not overly sweet, the intensity and structure easily carry both the sugar and the alcohol.  Complex and layered, lovely port.    I'd put this above Graham's 1985, just below Dow's 1985, but that may be personal preference more than an objective assessment of quality. "
19466,1206377,"What an amazingly rich and complex port, lovely nose and flavors just pour over and play on the palate to a smooth long finish"
19467,1206377,Phenomenally balanced wine with all the key elements. Drinking very well but wig great aging potential. Preserving its color quite well. Deliciously integrated fruit
19468,1206377,Very dark. Perfect rim. Very viscous.  Lovely fragrance of dried cherries. Big nose. Real class.  Enormous body. Dynamical. Fruity. Enough acidity.   Has breed.
19469,1206377,"Love this. I have always loved the peppery, spicey sweet Grenache and lack of excessive softness that has been the style Fonseca that over time. I recall the ‘63 like that. This is really wonderful. Fresh, vigorous, racy, not too heavy or sweet. Still quite young. Peak in 5 years ? It may soften and integrate but the risk is losing that wonderful peppery fruit. My bias is that now is the timebut a good case can be made that waiting will be repaid. 4.5"
19470,1206377,"Penultimate wine of the WSET Level 3 course. Fortified wines - Port 🇵🇹  Deep garnet colour.

19478,1206377,Sweet and strong. Lacks complexity.
19479,1636879,"Thought I'd try a Niepoort port instead of the Douro. This was less jammy and full. But that was good news as it was also more complex than the heavy Raisin oriented Douros, well the ones I've had 😄"
19480,1636879,"Niepoort ports tends to be priced a little above average - yet well worth the investment imho - this 2015 LBV is rich in texture - ripe concentrated balckberry bramble fruit - ripe tannins - somw smoke & tea tones - oange zest - sweet spices like cinnamon @LaGironde, Rotterdam. Have also tasted 2009, 2011 and 2012 LBVs from Niepoort"

19487,1636879,"They call it the ""Little Brother"" of the Vintage port, because the origin of the grapes and the vinification methods are identical. So time to enjoy  The nose opens with dark berries,  plums, mulberry, blackberries, and a slight whiff of chocolate Mighty but refined mouthfeel that shows a silky texture all beautifully fused with some chocolate notes and in the finish a nicely splash of espresso coffee. IMO it become increasingly more complex over a few decades. 3.9🌟"

Lots of black cherry, plum, prune, dried fruit, spices, dark chocolate; punchy tannins, med to high acidity - still a bit too young).

19495,1132949,A smooth port wine with a lot of flavours of cherry and fig. Perfect together with a Christmas dessert.  🎅🏼🎄  @[1|39643361|Stefan Hakmann]
19496,1132949,A touch sweet and lacking complexity but it is delicious and smooth at the same time. Pleasing. Bought in Portugal so harder to find but good cassis and cream notes to go along with ripe banana and vanilla bean. Good length. 4.1/5
19497,1132949,"88-89/100, 3,9* Nose of medium+ intensity with hints of ripe black cherry, raisins, figs, dark chocolate, cacao, rum. Sweet intense taste with quite perfect balance, high acidity, full body, raisins, chocolate, rum on the palate, medium+ complexity, medium+ length. Juicy and very harmonious Porto with chocolate nuances. Extremely good as digestive and standalone! Good QPR!"
19498,1132949,"Lovely LBV. Full of body and smooth with honey, nuts and raisin in taste"
19499,1132949,"Almonds and cherry, light notes of plum and anis. Not particularly complex or round. It’s fine but not great - probably cheap? "
19500,1132949,Not my favourite LBV. 🍷🍷🍷
19501,1132949,Very dark color and cherry overload - on the verge of marzipan vibes. 
19502,1132949,"Introduction to Port wine (no that we are novice to the style, but we won't say no to a free tasting!) LBV stands for late bottled vintage, meaning they're aged for quite a few years in oak before bottling.   The robe is lighter and pinker than a tawny. Younger and more fruity in the nose, with some berries notes. The palate is easy, polished but still very persistent."
19503,1132949,"Deep ruby in eye  Pronounced nose: prune, ripe cherry, cherry pip, and plum jam  Taste: nuts, honey, blackberry, cinnamon, coffee tones  Medium acidity  Medium tannins  Fullbodied  Long finish  Hedonistic level- medium "
19504,1132949,"Fruity, with test of wild berry, black сhocolate"
19505,1132949,Once again I love this crazy style of old fashioned Porto- extremely fruity- forest fruits; cherry accents; good stuff 
19506,1132949,"Great value! Very nice port! prune, dried fig, tobacco and autumn fallen leafs. Good stricter and character."
19507,1132949,"Garnet colour. Jammy red fruits, strawberry, peanut, meat, tobacco, minty and herbaceous finish. A bit austere with drying tannins... but so young. Need a good decant or more aging."
19508,1132949,"Superb porto...ruby, red dried fruits with nuts. Sharm & warming 🍷"
19509,76378,"4.1⭐ Delicious Colheita! 20% alc. Notes of dried fruits, walnuts, chocolate, brown sugar and caramel. Deep and concentrated. Smooth and well balanced.  Delicious long lingering finish 😋 "
19510,76378,"Dried fruits, licorice and syrup. Very pleasant and a nice finish"
19511,76378,Sweet and full flavour. A bit oakey but on a nice side 
19512,76378,"Rich nose of cassis de Dijon, cherry liqueur, orange peel, brown sugar, toffee and brandy soaked walnuts. Rich and sweet but well-balanced with great acidity and a nicely bitter touch. Really great value. 91p"
19513,76378,"3,7⭐️ 🍷Colour: Ruby red. 👃🏻Nose: Raisins and brown sugar, dried figs, honey and caramel. 👅Mouth: Brown sugar, raisins, dried fruit and a light acidity. Notes of nuts, chocolate, oak and vanilla. Dried fruits and spices in the end. "
19514,76378,Yes I’m going to be beachfront 
19515,76378,Still a bit of grip despite the colour
19516,76378,Very complex and long lasting flavours. The age really shows and makes for an engaging experience.
19517,76378,"Amber color, slightly sharp nose (it’s young), rich sweet taste, raisins and walnuts. Good long aftertaste. A bargain at 115kr at Philipson (liquidation sale 😔)"
19518,76378,"Amber color. Smooth tannins. Slightly too much sweetness. Palate shows raisin, caramel, vanilla, oak, dried fruit, blackberry and plum. Good pair with cheese plate."
19519,76378,"Fruity, nutty, toffee, with delightful acidity - a rich, intense and concentrate port wine that never stops to amaze me - a very elegant port "
19520,76378,This port makes my heart sing. Forty five years--1963 to 2008 on oak. Magnificent balance. Pairs well with a 60 year old pre embargo cigar.
19521,76378,Drinking port with the angels ! I often think colheita more complex than vintage port. This has been in the barrel for 18 years before bottling
19522,76378,"Outstanding, I am not experienced enough to really say. However this is by far one of the best experiences I have had with ANY wine. Mind-blowing"
19523,76378,The best whine ever made!
19524,1234518,"One of my favorites. On the nose, Pear, green apple. On the palate,  Saline and minerals with some citrus Light yello and clear color.  Lightly sparkling."
19525,1234518,"Wow what a great wine! Starting with perfect green apple, then comes some citrus and finish with lemon. Very nice and long lasting afteraste, perfectly ballance. Worth to try! "
19526,1234518,Lovely subtle sweetness from elderflower or honeysuckle with a pleasant sharpness of lime
19527,1234518,"Good vinho verde. Delicate, refreshing. Citrus palate. Went well with shrimp 🦐 and octopus 🐙!"
19528,1234518,"See you next time, I'll always come back"
19529,1234518,"A classic vinho verde, maybe a 3.7? Light and delightful drinking. "
19530,1234518, citrus green apple minerals peach
19531,1234518,"For lunch we had this 🇵🇹 Vinho Verde to pair with our bruschetta.  A surprisingly quaffable wine and paired well with our meal and sunny weather.  So crisp and refreshing the neighbours stopped by when they saw us pop it on the dock. Fresh notes of green apple, citrus, pear and melon. Great price!"
19532,1234518,"Tasted in Lisbon!  Medium- high acid, classic vinho verde. Lemon, citrus, slightly frizzante in the mouth.  Refreshing on a warm day!"
19533,1234518,Lovely Vino Verde. Ideal lunchtime tipple. Goes as well with sandwiches as some great fish dishes. Slight fizz dry lemon grapefruit kick. 
19534,1234518,"Lightly effervescent. Young and fresh. Fizzy apple juice, lemon lime, minerality, pear apricot melon, lots of fruit. Great on it's own. Serious QPR. 3.7-3.8 ⭐"
19535,1234518,"Got it served chilled with some grilled fish and it tastes fruity, refreshing, light, and a tiny bit sparkling on the tongue. Goes easy with the food. "
19536,1234518,Probably the best vinho verde I’ve had. Apricot for days 
19537,1234518,"Dry. Just the way ACR likes it. At Restaurant in Arouca, Portugal. "
19538,1234518,"Very Pale parchment, with a fence off slow legs around the glass. Nose of dense tarte tatin with a touch of brightness at the end. Crisp attack that moves into a rich , mouth coasting mid-palate—light weight w/an unctuousness in the finish—acidy with almost pear honey at the end. Not what I expected, but good. "
19539,1162976,"4.3. Oohhh this is tasty!  Very young still -- this has a couple decades to maturity -- but already delicious. The nose has raspberry jam, prune, chocolate covered raisins, fig, and licorice.  The palate is intense, basically matching the nose, but adds blueberry compote. Moderate sweetness, but also medium+ acidity. Intense and delicious. "
19540,1162976,"I don’t drink much ports/dessert wines, but I got to admit this is a very good wine. It’s not overly sweet, honey, oxidized yet with the complexity. Great intensity on the palate and it just lingers. The lingering finish is crazy. Everyone who doesn’t drink port should drink this. "
19541,1162976,Fantastic Wine!  Already in a good drinking window.  Everything you want from a great Port.
19542,1162976,My rating 4.5 RWC rating 4.3*  Russian Wine Club  22.04.2016 Porto Night
19543,1162976,"Top, fantastisch mooi fruit, en Minou 20 jaar 😎"
19544,1162976,"OMG wow 🤩  This is a magnum bottle, but still “too” young to drink. I’m very excited to try another one in about years from now. "
19545,1162976,"Tasting at Niepoort cellars in Vila Nova de Gaia in Porto. 2000 was apparently a great vintage for Niepoort, and this showed in the intensity of the flavours. From 60+yr vines from the typical Douro schist soil of Vinha da Pisca, Pinhão+Ferrão.  Nose: savoury and intense caramel+fried fig. Some nice peppery notes.  Palate: continuation of the nose in a quite full body: intense fig bomb followed by oxidative notes of soy sauce/yolk. Long umami finish."
19546,1162976,"Fabulous!!!! Massive wine, not showing its age. Dark color. Sweet and intense. Doesn’t let go. My favorite port maker. It has a distinctive dusty aroma to it. "
19547,1162976,And again I can only give 5 stars. Don't understand want to understand why this wine was not well received by my regular friends. I didn't care because this port is just gross. Very personality and spicy. Limitlessly long. For me the perfect end to the evening. Goed well with the mouse of dark chocolate with lighter sauce and Sauternes Jelly knowledge. 97/100
19548,1162976,"95. pH 3.59, RS 103 g/l. Deep ruby. Intense aromas of sweet black cherries, prunes, figs, raisins, chocolate, licorice, leather. Full bodied, full grained tanins, fruity and fresh. Still young, but drinking very well. Excelent!"
19549,1162976,"Lovely.  But would benefit from more time as the finish is still sharp.  Need to wait five years.  But lovely caramel, mocha and sweet black fruit on the palate. "
19550,1162976,"For me, the best vintage port I've ever tasted. Chocolate, mocha and red fruits galore."
19551,1162976,"3.8-/5 ⭐️ Fine deep and sweet red and black fruit, coffee and dark chocolate  🔎 Appearance: clear; medium+ garnet   👃🏻 Nose: clean; pronounced- intensity; aromas of deep and sweet red and black fruit, dark chocolate, raisins, coffee; developed  👅 Palate: sweet; medium acidity; fortified high alcohol; medium body; pronounced- flavour intensity; flavours of, raisins, red spices, fruit, dark fruit, herbs, chocolate, liquriche; long finish"
19552,1162976,"4++ Only 103 grs RS, made of 7 varieties, bottled in 2002. Went through a 2 hr decanting before tasting. On a side note: tried moist sediments - delicious! (Tannic and sweet ""wine paté""). Blackish dark cherry color. N: savage honey, cocoa, balsamic, smoke. P: very powerful, meaty (full bodied!), sweet tannin, very long finish. Loved it a lot but rated only 4+ due to its hefty price tag (80-100€)."
19553,1162976,"Dark concentrated and rich. Very flavourful, but lacks some finesse and depth."
19554,2395325,"It’s an experience to drink this unique Portuguese wine. It should be kept at a cooler temperature and then allowed to breathe in the glass. As it breathes, the flavor opens up so it’s maybe better to start with sips to check out the changes. "
19555,2395325,"A special bottle, took nearly two hours to open properly. Small cork delicately removed in one piece with regular corkscrew. Nose dominated by menthol and forest floor, with still-kicking blackberry, raspberry, plum, black licorice and tight tannins. Saddle leather, cedar. Slight twinge of vinegar needs the fat of a rich meal to cut - paired with a dry-aged Snake River Farms NY strip and was delicious. Rusty garnet color. A big wine with an everlasting finish, if perhaps slightly past its absolute prime. "
19556,2395325,"Earthy notes, tobacco, mint with nice jammy red fruit of cherry and raspberry, remarkable freshness given the age.   Palate was M-F bodies with very supple tannins and good acidity.   Unbelievable given the age"
19557,2395325,"94 rating! OMG! Dow! Still fruity for a 65'. Very aged palate with great cherry, tobacco, leather and raisins. amazing wine."
19558,2395325,"Something fucking special for 1000th. Seems to be kinda 'late bottled' due to label and cork being rather intact. Dark garnet with rusty brown rim, some sediment present. Initial weird funk is quickly gone, remain tar and damp earth, basil and balsamic. On tongue cranberry and pan glaze, mint and dogwood berry, iron and plum sauce, dog rose infusion — everything persists and interleaves wave-wise. Savoury yet retained much of fruitiness on palate, goddamn juicy. Go get some, while still available."
19559,2395325,"Dark fruit, violet. Lovely wine"
19560,2395325,"Needs aging!!! Media, god som bare Det "
19561,2395325,Fruits confit tannique en bouche  
19562,2395325,"Really interesting wine. The nose isn't too dissimilar to an old Barolo, tar/leather and dried flowers. Palate is nothing like old Barolo hahaha. It's really bizarre, and I'm assuming atypical, but the main fruit characteristic is like this tart stewed plum. Then there is a whole bunch of tannin that comes through. Unbelievable to see this level of acidity, tannin and even salinity from a wine of this age. Anyway that's my rant about the 67"
19563,2395325,"Chilled red wine , so tannin is lighter than normal , still very high acidity , tastes lots of herbs , quite strange combinations "
19564,2395325,Fantastic bottle that is full of subtlety. Starts with gravel and fig aromas. Medium texture. As it opens there is just so much more going on. Really enjoyed this
19565,2395325,"Light mahogany purple. Smells of dried strawberries, forest floor and dusty old wooden shelves. A bit of mushroom on the palate, fully resolved dried plum fruit with fine-grained tannins giving a small kick on the finish. Mature and graceful."
19566,2395325,"Dark Ruby some purple. Semi bold and dry. Good acidity. A pleasant and “different” wine. Forest floor, minerals, red currant and plum. Nice finish with some bitter taste."
19567,2395325,Rating: 4.2  Vintage: 2012  Nose: Charred Green Bell Pepper. Dried Leather. Earth. Damp Oak. Menthol (slight).  Palate: Several different fruits peaking at different intervals (Cherry. Strawberry. Raspberry. Plum.). Raisin and Milk Chocolate  midway. A vegetal note on the backend (Rhubarb).   Body: M Body. M+ Tannins. Dry. M+ Acidity.   Color: Mahogany (w/ Ruby edges).  Grape: Ramisco (100%)  ABV: 12.5%  Notes: Definitely an interesting wine. Bottle is in 500ml format. 
19568,2395325,"Fresh and fruity nose of strawberries, redcurrant, sour cherries, oak and a hint of eucalyptus. Medium bodied and quite tight with firm acidity and soft tannins. Somewhat akin to an older style of Rioja or Barolo. I rather like it. 92-94p."
19569,1629556,"As always, a bargain!"
19570,1629556,"Shellfish dinner option 2: Fruity and very fresh, pear, citrus and a little stone. I’m my opinion a very nice fit for shellfish 🦐 🦀 🦪 "
19571,1629556,"Kind, light and fruity. 💛 Perfect for a non-meal. Had this after a fish meal outside an island at Bolærne in Tønsberg🌊 "
19572,1629556,"Not the best, not the worst. Midt on the tree🌳"
19573,1629556,"Sur, men ok"
19574,1629556,"""Tutti fruiti"" wine with taste of apple, pear and sweet lemon. If i have been eighteen, I had loved it. "
19575,1629556,"A great wine for its price,very well suited for Codfish!"
19576,1629556,"Fruity, a little sweet "
19577,1629556,Drinkable table wine.Ok with fish.
19578,1629556,"Medium bodied, velvety smooth, crunchy ripe pear and yellow plum, medium (+) acidity, refreshing lime backbone. Dry. IMO perfect sushi 🍣 wine.  🍇- 100% Arinto"
19579,1629556,"Fresh, citrus and pear. Drinked with bolinhos de bacalau"
19580,1629556,What a great balance between sweetness and punch! Almost silky to the palette but complex. Love it (and the price!)
19581,1629556,"Remember me some german riesling. Not so acid. But minerality from the begining, citric freshness and untuosity."
19582,1629556,"👁 straw yellow in colour 👃🏻 Quite  fruity of citrus , green herbs , tropical fruit  ans apricot 👅 pear , citrus , minerals Fresh ans fruity , crispy and refreshing . Well worth 💲 "
19583,1629556,"creamy and juicy, dried tropical fruits, vanilla custard, anise, white pepper, should be good with the summer sea food. A bargain!"
19584,76372,"Very enjoyable 21 year old to close out the evening of NMTB. Smooth with a hint of raisin, but not omnipresent like some one dimensional offerings😊"
19585,76372,"Very nice port.  Enjoyed it 5 evenings in a row and it just kept on going Nutty aromas, raisin and dates fruit.  "
19586,76372,"Toasted almonds with a hint of coconut, a hint of saffron  on nose. Nice ripe figs, and golden raisins,dried dates, and black walnut on taste"
19587,76372,"Retasting! Light to medium hazy deep brick color. Yellow raisins, burnt suggar, molasse, spice, smoke, and hints of oak and citrus peal at the nose. Sweet yellow raisins, folowed by caramel, brown sugar, spice, orange and citrus, and citrus peal towards the finish. Nice long finish. "
19588,76372,"4.3. Clear, pale amber. Clean, high intensity aroma of orange peel, caramel, honey, saline and almond. Sweet, high acidity, low tannins, full body and long finish. Palate confirms the nose. Decanter FWE. "
19589,76372,"3 Wine Men Portugal tasting. 19y6m. C: Med tawny N: Med+ intense hazelnut, toffee, caramel, dried fig, dried apricot, medicine, iodine, orange peel & lily. Med- complex, med+ clarity. A bit more white flowers than the 1980. P: Dried apricot, fig -> prune, honey, exotic spices -> hazelnut & dates. Med length, high conc & acid, full bod, low subtle tannins. Less aromatic intensity but longer finish than the 1980. Very enjoyable. 90p."
19590,76372,"Had expected more from this house and year, but still a great Colheita. Wins with 20-30 minutes air."
19591,76372,"Sweet, caramel, nuts, raisin, smooth, good"
19592,76372,Delicious with good sweetness but cloying. 
19593,76372,Young with potential.
19594,76372,Always a pleasure to drink Colheita from Kopke. 👍👍🍷🍷🍷🍷
19595,76372,You can taste the alcohol but very nice. 
19596,76372,Excellent Colheita - still fresh fruit in the palate with an aftertaste that goes on and on...
19597,76372,"The end of the evening wine. Huge figs, raisins, and caramel."
19598,76372,Nice and elegant Colheita. Hints of nuts and caramel. Pleasant drinking. 
19599,76372,If I could give this 6 stars I would. Words are inadequate to describe the complexity of flavours along with the perfect balance and acidity. Amazing.
19600,76372,An old tawny with a wonderful acidity that makes this Kopke port once more a delicious and very attractive port - complex and with a very fine structure - an intense and beautiful wine 😊
19601,76372," Wow. !!!  Hard to believe that you will find something better than this absolutely beautiful Kopke colheita from the year 1941 , bottled in 2019 , so almost 80 years in barrels. Just amazing. 🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
19602,76372,"4.7/5.0 Colheita 1941 (!!!). Bottled 01.2021 (👍). 150 gr sugar, but... This is incredible fortified wine!  Pale tawny color. Pronounced intensity aromas,  very complex and elegant! Licorice, nutty, walnuts, prunes, coffee, earth. Sweet. med. acidity. High alco.  Resume:  outstanding 😍 Kopke colheita vertical, 06.2021"
19603,76372,"I HAVE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN! 😇  I experienced a port flight at the Society of Wine Educators conference. Three were vintage and three were colheita.  This 1941 blew me away! From the glimmering amber hue to the deep complexity of its nose and palate, I could only sit and sigh with each precious sip.  Caramel hazelnut exwuisiteness!  Though it's protocol to sip, swish and spit at these conference sessions, none of us dumped this nectar into the spittoon. That would practically be sacrilege!"
19604,76372,"NYWE 2017 Grand Tasting Oct. 20 WS review...  93 - Loaded with rich and lively flavors of white chocolate and buttercream, this features glazed apricot and citrus zest notes on the intensely spicy finish, with hints of white pepper.   Simply great!! Tada!!🍷🍷💃🏻"
19605,76372,"An absolute highlight of the W&S Top 100 tasting in SF in October 2018. Rich, sweet, but with acid balance. Clearly superior to the other aged ports on offer, despite the fact that they were all excellent and some 30+ years old."
19606,76372,Copper walnut color. Dried and candied fruits almonds and peanut nice mouthfeel well balanced sweetness and long finish. 
19607,76372,Grand Tasting 2017. ❤️❤️❤️ amazing and likely out of my price range 
19608,76372,Amazing port well balanced and aged with very clear black pepper
19609,76372,"Fantastic 70-years Colheita Port with outstanding expression. Complex on the nose, with toffee, caramel, raisin, dried figs and dates. On palate medium sweet, with M+acidity, fortified high alcohol and Medium bodied. M+ flavour intensity with sour plums (酸梅乾)，Chinese herbs, dried dates. Great complexity with well integrated alcohol that fits seamlessly without any burning sensation. Good depth on the finish. "
19610,76372,"Tasted at Robert Parker - matter of taste. Dark caramel color.  Nose of raisin, spicy and nutty. Raisin, toffee, chocolate, candy orange peel, walnut on the palate.  Very light and silky mouth feel, complex, long-finished."
19611,76372,"Specially bottled for the Confraria do Vinho do Porto's first visit to Vancouver, Canada, this is a testament to the excellence of Kopke. At an incredible 75 years old, it's amazingly fresh and clean with an intense nutty complexity and endless fi"
19612,76372,Older than me. But I don't really understand Colheitas!
19613,76372,"Very enjoyable 21 year old to close out the evening of NMTB. Smooth with a hint of raisin, but not omnipresent like some one dimensional offerings😊"
19614,45454,Incredible port!!! It most likely should be kept for another... 25 years - but it’s VERY drinkable now
19615,45454,"So much for planning. I was saving this for 2027. But who has the patience these days? I definitely missed out on the best version of this wine. Well, I brought this on myself. It is still a fantastic Port, though. Dense inky purple pour with a reddish ring. Complex nose of blueberries, plum, dried fruit, fig, raisins, toffee, chocolate, cigar leaves, tobacco. Gorgeous. Velvety dreamy texture. Deep flavors of dried fruit, caramel, bitter dark chocolate, honey, cloves and a refreshing mint finish. "
19616,45454,"Very dark on the nose with violets and a touch of a deep rose scent. Plums and brambles also come through with a sweet earthiness as well. On the palate you get plums, brambles and a bit of violet towards the end of the fruit. A beautiful wine. "
19617,45454,"Stunning Vintage Port!  A lush and powerful traditional Douro blend, with lots from five exceptional estates(“Quintas”). Bold, rich and complex, with juicy acidity and splendid length. Deep purple color, floral, ripe dark berries aroma/flavors, specially blackberry, with notes of cassis, licorice, raisins, mint, chocolate and spices. Sweet and fresh, with silky smooth texture and an endless tasty finish. Exquisite treat!"
19618,45454,"4.5 Don't you love those great Ports !! The complex nose blending powerfully cooked fruits, spices, cocoa, cigar and cedar wood. And the power of the palate, its richness and silkiness that stays with you. A little silence and concentration please !"
19619,45454,"Right at opening you get some acidity, elderberry, dark cherry, a little smoke, hint of cedar, vanilla, pepper and a slight floral note along a subtle sweetness. Not too well balanced at first but after 6 hrs of air it’s start to come together and become harmonious with the acidity, sweetness and power becoming a great mix along with some butter on the palette as well."
19620,45454,"95pts me 97RP 96WS  A classic vintage port that embodied the smooth and delicate flavors of graham   Nose of dark blackcurrant. Bitter chocolate with peppery mulberrieses leaf over roasted black cherries and dried figs with good dose minty nail polish sense   Very youthful   Ripe massive wine and the power, intensity, and flavors are overwhelming flowing over me  Spicy alocholic yet the complexity kept it together.   This will easily age for 25+ years"
19621,45454,More fruit forward and light. Could use 5 more years to age before it will be at its top level
19622,45454,"Fruity, very smooth"
19623,45454,"Amazing port, best one ever had, complex, pairing so well with cheesecake and tiramisu"
19624,45454,"96 full bodied peppery and spicy. Fruit bomb.  RP 97 WS 96 8.2019 wow! 97-98 complex, condensed, chocolate, coffee and caramel, eucaliptus or mint, pepper. Multi layered. "
19625,45454,"I typically find port to be a little too thick in mouthfeel and overly sweet, but the spicy finish and lighter mouthfeel of this one is just wonderful. I get cocoa, lingonberry, basil in that order - very evolutionary."
19626,45454,"Clear, deep ruby. Clean, pronounced intensity aroma of strawberry jam, blueberry, blackberry, violet, licorice. Sweet, high acidity, medium plus tannins, full body and long finish. Palate confirms the nose. Outstanding. Boardroom experience. "
19627,45454,Dense and bitter. Some acidity masked by ample dried fruits; good fascinating complexity. Long finish with meat and mushrooms. Would keep it for 10 more years and then revisit. 90-92
19628,45454,"Deep inky purple. The aroma is big, sweet and lots of stewed fruit with fig, herbs and black pepper on the nose. The palate is very big with well integrated tannins. Big and long bold finish."
19629,88295,Very smooth and easy drinking from wine society - lots of crisp red apple and black cherry fruit with milk chocolate on surprisingly lasting aftertaste. 
19630,88295,"Great and smooth Portuguese. On the nose, blackberry, oak and leather notes. Low acidity, full body and high tannins. On palate, blackberry, oak, vanilla and pepper notes. Medium finish."
19631,88295,"Nice mid-palate, nice plushness, & a very varietal, if early-drinking, blend. I’m impressed with this low-priced offering. The bouquet of a 6-7-year-old Douro already on this 2017. I love the varietal-blend bouquet & fun fruit. Round in the mouth. Not heavy, but it is very fruity. Modest overall & w/o length. No tannins. Some vanilla on the tail. Surprisingly good for the low tab. But drink up. 4.0 woofers. It took me a while to appreciate the name. A happy visit there near Pinhão a few years ago. Value."
19632,88295,"Another fine Douro, smooth, easy to drink; will happily re-stock this one."
19633,88295,"Bold, tannic, oaky, with a taste of black fruits. Quite nice!"

Intensity on the nose is light. Not too much happening. Notes of Apple and citrus. On the palate, not a great deal happening. It's a little wishy-washy.

19662,1162976,"bought these in the first half of the 1980s and open at Christmas 2020;  43 years old.  Brown and clear light in color, the color remained in the drape.  Taste is fine, beautifully sweet and even more beautiful in the long aftertaste. With also a touch of fruit, wonderful."

19666,1162976,"Surprise of the winemaker. After hé invited us to stay for lunch, hé had another surprise for us with this truly amazing and gastronomic vintage Port. You can't believe its concentration and flavour intensity until you tried this one. Highly recommended.  You will enjoy it for a few hours after.  "
19667,1162976,"1997 was a stellar port year. And it is showing in this beauty.  Wonderful subtle impressions of dried fruits, raisins, apricots. Some alcohol impressions too. On the palate very well integrated flavors of dried fruits, a hint of nuts too. Great balance and with just exact enough acidity. Very very good."
19668,1162976,"ECLECTIC JUICE  Looking for Port outside the mainstream? Enter Dirt Niepport, a Renaissance man with a slight aversion to tradition. From a 98 pt vintage, this bottle is packed with thick, chewy flavors!  Dense purple tumbling into the glass, it emits aromas of beautiful violet & blue fruits. Thick but delicate, the palate reveals flavors of blueberry, licorice & cherry cola with silky tannins and a light woody note, all coated in a soft leathery finish that goes on for minutes. Elegant! 93 pts"
19669,1162976,"93/100 It smells dark and dense, this vintage is incredibly young for its age. Notes of dark plum, black cherry, mocha, and pepper. This is very dense and the tannins are still fierce. There is a great feeling of orange peel acidity and intensity. Put this away for a couple more decades."
19670,1162976,"This is a real Vintage Port -  This is Niepoort! Vintage Port is only produced in the best years, 2007 was a really good Port-wine vintage Purple-(red) colour, nearly black Aromas of chocolate, dried herbs, spieces, amarena cherries and vanilla with an oaky touch On the palate complex and concentrated with still young tannins; really smooth with a touch of pepper and berries.  Long finish with a fruity aftertaste and hints of leather Lots of potential- wait another 5-10 years! That's a true Niepoort Port!"
19671,1162976,"4,4 stars. At the end of a marathonic blind taste, I was not in condition anymore to take notes on this 33 years old Port.  Nevertheless, the classiness of it was stunningly obvious, with a top notch lushness, that is hard to describe in terms of its outstanding texture, that was mindblowing in conjunction with fresh elegant inky compote berry fruit, plum, fig, liquorice & prunes and a whole load of lovely smooth spices. Acidity easily caught up the sweetness, to make this a balanced luscious gem."
19672,1162976,"Well balanced and a long length. Silky, full bodied with out feeling jammy or jelly. Nutty nose of candied almond. Light density for a port. Medium acidity. Notes of red cherry, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, raisin, leather. Well structured "

19676,1212857,"Lacked a little depth, or maybe it was not the first bottle that day 😉"
19677,1212857,Good....but i don't like Porto.....
19678,1212857,"Although 1999 is not generally considered a great vintage in the Douro (only declared by a number of houses), I enjoyed this one. Classic aroma-flavours of raisins, dark chocolate, nutmeg, molasses. Still youthful but already accessible compared to more renowned vintages. Perhaps lacking in fruit concentration and power, but this vintage provides relative value and earlier accessibility. Good QPR. "
19679,1212857,"Very nicely balanced Vintage Port, which can age for far longer. Raspberries. Plums and cherries. Very full, but also smooth. Refined and with depth. A hint of nuts in the finish."
19680,1212857,"A fabulous Vintage Port made in a great year. Powerful and intense aromas of black cherry, raspberry preserves, baked peppery plum, mint, licorice and a delightful sweet caramel sensation. Rich, elegant and delicate with present but not overpowering tannins towards the lasting finale. It seems to be still youthful, as this will reach its maturity plateau in 2050!"
19681,1212857,"4. This is a very nice, lovely to drink Port. Not the most complex offering out there, but showing very good balance. Nose of prunes, dsrk chocolate, and lots of licorice, with interesting iodine notes on the palate, and a flash of dried cranberry and some caramel right at the end. Delightful. "
19682,1212857,Cannot tell why but it’s so delicious well balanced with sweet acid vanilla and all other tastes - Perfect harmony - best port I have had since a while 
19683,1212857,Great example of the quality that can be found at such a low price. Drinking 2020-2030. 
19684,1212857,"Catch up notes from Qta. do Crasto tasting, #10 & last up, the vintage Port, a traditional field blend aged 2yrs in large Portuguese oak.  Deep ruby. Amazing concentration on the pronounced aroma intensity. Spicy black plum, cherry, black cherry, peppercorn & sweet spice. Heady & plush. Developing w. dried fruit notes.  Sweet. Rich & viscous w. chewy m+ tannins, m+ acid & high alc. Lovely richness w. crème de mure, black cherry jam, vanilla, cinnamon & raisin. Full bodied w. a long finish w. sweet spices."
19685,1212857,"Balanced, but still young needs time to round itself and express more - lighter vintage - still needs to breath before enjoying"
19686,1212857,He has a very dark ruby ​​and is almost opaque in color. with intense aromas of very ripe fruits.
19687,1212857,"A port with a subtle sweetness, red fruit, dark fruit raisin black cherry forward. Well balanced a a nice finished with a good finish in acidity and fruit sweetness. Could well pair with a blue cheese or even chocolate. Nevertheless enjoying the wine alone is something I would recommend "
19688,1212857,Cork crumbled so I feel I got some corkie taste and that was a disappointment.  I was expecting something more. Smooth but not far superior to Six Grapes (one third the price).  Color is good ruby clear.  Taste lingers but finished a little sharp.

Kopke style is too sweet for my palate but I do not argue, it is outstanding"

19713,76372,"My dad has turned 60 today and he brought just the perfect bottle for celebrating the occasion 🎊🎉!  👀 Aged perfectly into a dark cognac version with brown sugar and orange zest glance.  👃 Divinity and pure subtlety with orange zest, mandarin, honey suckled dried prunes and just the slightest vegetable note.  👅 So pure and concentrated with a subtle hint of the wood ageing. Again the sugar caned fruits, apricot, and a tiny bitter in the lingering finish."
19714,76372,"Coming from Madeira difficult not to find this kind of wines the most interesting we tried...  A bit of oxidation to make it a complex wine,  with acidity nuts,  dried figs and apricots,  nice mouthfeel and full power in spite their age...  Highly recommended...."
19715,76372,"Fantastic, luscious wine, it seems like this wine never stop maturing. Extremely expressive aromas on the nose ( baking spices, walnut, dried prunes,figs.)  the palate is living up to the notes the nose; very concentrated with a good acidity and never ending aftertaste "

19717,76372,The 1961 vintage of the Kopke colheita is excellent. Bottled in 2017 after 56 years of aging in the cellars of Porto it has a amber brown color and some debris of course. The bouquet is outstanding and it has an extremely long delicate finish. A perfect treat for my 60th birthday.

19737,2078187,"Really nice, interesting and complex Vinho Verde. Pronounced in palate with tangy citrus acidity, green pear, green apple, pineapple, lime, grapefruit. Wet stones minerality and faint salinity. "
19738,2078187,"I would sniff the whole bottle. What an inviting nose : full of peer and sea air.  The palate is citrus, of the correct intensity for this price class...  Very enjoyable, as were the oysters! "
19739,2078187,"(4.0) Yellow colour, citrus flavour with elegant and mineral profile. Both tropical fruit floral tones. Very vibrant and accessible due to low alcohol%. Great value for this price @okhuysen"
19740,2078187,"Peach bomb in the nose, medium body with medium acids but actually you feel it like super silky with every sip. So ripened grape it also feels like it has a very little amount of residual sugar. Perfect!"
19741,2078187,"Very direct and simple, yet undeniably enjoyable - lemon, grapefruit, green pear, and a bit of mineral like slate. Thus makes for a wonderful seafood pairing - a noticeable step up from cheap Vinho Verde commonly available in the US, but still a great deal at $14. Reminded me of Spanish Albarino, but cleaner in flavor."
19742,2078187,"A lot of green apple and lemon on the nose, both of which repeat in full force on the punchy and acidic palate. Don’t serve this cold, just barely chilled, and some grass and minerality will appear. Medium plus finish that calls apple skin. Refreshing, surprisingly deep, and delicious. Great QPR."
19743,2078187,"Color: clear, pale lemon yellow  Aroma: green apple, peach, pear, lemon, lime, honey, grapefruit, melon,  Flavor: rich peachy note on nose as vinho verde, tropical fruit and minerals flavor on palate, well balanced on sweetness and fruity flavor, slight bitter finish  Had at Asahikawa Hokkaido"
19744,2078187,"Wow this is really lovely. Huge hit of lime,  a tiny bit of spritz. Really concentrated fruit. Acidity is zingy indeed. Low alcohol. Some skilled winemaking here. Amazing value from Decantalo. Would absolutely buy again. Perfect stuff for warm weather garden supping ! "
19745,2078187,"Soalheiro is always a good producer and this Vinho Verde is excellent. Refreshing, fruity and slightly spritzy  On the nose, pear and citrus Pear is the dominant fruit flavour but with some quince, and then lime and lemon zest High, prickly acidity Lovely saline finish  Perfect summer wine and great value "
19746,2078187,"70% Loureiro, 30% Alvarinho. The major grape in this blend needs low heat throughout the ripening season otherwise Loureiro will lose freshness ansmd the flowerish character, it's naturally a low PH grape in general. Shiny golden with light viscosity. Ripe peach, ripe apples, huge dosage of jasmin. Med+ acidity, apple dominancy, gentle malic acid profile, no MF, Alvarinho gives the body but it's still a loght style summer apertif wine could be pefect for sea-fingerfood. Good winemaking job. 4 indeed. "
19747,2078187,"4⭐️ for this Portugueses Vinho Verde 🇵🇹 white wine. 👁 Clear visual with a pale straw color.👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry with white fruits and a second sniff focused on pear, flowers and minera. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of pear.

19750,76372,"NO FOOLING ABOUT HERE...  except for the two lovebirds in the background! Jay & the Mrs are the perfect backdrop for a stunner that almost defies words. Minimum 7 years in the barrel, this single vintage Tawny smells like a nut factory dipped in caramel and dusted with carmelized brown sugar and hints of cinnamon & toffee.  If you've never tried a Colheita, join the howling of the Port hounds and dip your toe in the deep end. Arrrroooooo!!!!!!!! Simply masterful. Thank you Jay. 98 pts"

19757,76372,"What a delicious experience! Perhaps the best port I've ever tasted!! So sweet, warm, tender and concentrated flavors of raisins, figs and walnuts. Thank you, Tim, for sharing :-)"
19758,76372,"If you're celebrating something, better do it right! Kopke released this wine for the 2nd time around in 2011. As far as I know, it's a sell out and won't be available anymore. After having been locked up for 45 years in barrel, this is still a fairly young and vigorous wine. Bronze coloured,perfume of almonds and raisins. Full bodied,syrupy,high in alcohol on the palate. Light touch of butterscotch chocolate and caramel sticky date pudding. Figs too. Amazing finish. Don't brush you're teeth till next day!"
19759,76372,"52 years old - brought  back from Porto last wk & opened to toast my father in law....& simply stunning - without doubt the best Port I’ve ever been lucky enough to enjoy.  Deep amber colour, phenomenal deep aromas of maple, deep burnt caramel, toffee, vanilla, baked raisined fruits, vanilla & almonds - remarkably complex  So intense on the palate, deep baked fruits, nuts, maple, caramel all conch through.

19773,1917169,Smooth & subtle  
19774,1917169,"Three types of white used in the wine,six months in barrels, ripe yellow apples, pear on the nose, oak, off dry palate and 13.5% Alc."
19775,1917169,"Light-bodied soft green colour has a fresh tropical nose with some acidity, dry on mouth with hints of pinnacle and other tropical fruits but also citrus. Nice contrast between acidity and fruit flavor, very fresh wine, finish loses most of the taste remaining the freshness like a mint flavor. Very nice!"
19776,1917169,"Super light straw color.   Light green apple aromas.   Strong minerality, a bit briny on the palate. Nice and cleansing after a day touring the port wineries in Porto. "
19777,1917169,"Resin springs to mind. Full bodied proper Douro, needs a bit of refinement, but you can taste the quality of the winemakers. Should become better wth  new vintages"
19778,1917169,"Tasty, light toasted taste, makes me compare to sherry"
19779,8328815,"What a delicious wine! 😍 A very tropical fruity wine. It is light in the mouth, but has a very powerful taste.   Nose: fresh lemon and peach. Aromas of a white wine. Green apple, Peach, lemon and some pepper.  "
19780,8328815,"One of the top Rosé for Portugal im my opinion. Pale rose color, very light but with a very strong taste, accounting for the specific grape. Red fruits, pepper, maybe some other fruit, peach. A must taste."
19781,8328815,Bottle number 0681/2541 meaning this is special. It has sold out so we are lucky to have bought 6. An orange rose colour in glass with nice clarity. A good nose flowery. In the mouth quite a different taste with a sharp but pleasant edge. Kiwi fruit sharp but very enjoyable. Met the approval of SWMBO so a good recommendation . Do try it if you can find it.

19784,8328815,"Fruity, delicate, light "
19785,1136082,"Dark, almost black, purple color. Intense nose, exotic sweet fruit scents; pineapple and very mature honey melons. The taste is soft, sweet, complex and firm strong body. The aftertaste is versatile and slightly medical and spicy. "
19786,1136082,"Intense fruit and raisins, still vibrant. Wait at least a decade for better age payoff."
19787,1136082,Nice dryish port with not too much of an oxidized character. 
19788,1136082,"Balanced, Still quite youthfull, intensive dark fruit. Not toonsweet.  Nice complex nose. Lots of sediment. I would defenedly buy again."

19794,1136082,Very fruity and sweet. Dark color 
19795,1136082,"Very round. It is almost ideal,  what round port should be.  Very fruitty,  some fried apples. Some alcohol can be felt after finish."
19796,1136082,"Fairly dull really, not a lot of flavour behind the overpowering sweetness"
19797,1136082,"92 Opened this beauty of a magnum for my birthday bash. Aroma had plums, prunes, raisins, dates and vanilla. Over the palate came overripe plums, dates, raisins, vanilla and figs.  Medium acidity, low tannins and sweet. Still plenty of life left. Lovely!"

19811,1153067," blackberry, pomegranate, pepper, coffee, smooth and rich "
19812,1153067,Not a great port. Young and straightforward. Red berries. But lacks a bit of depth and complexity.
19813,1153067,"Blueberry, sweet, strawberries, good with meat "
19814,1153067,Great paring with strong cheese or dark chocolate.  Sweet and nice plum finish.  Served after dinner with desserts.

19818,8967,"Portugal tasting, had this next to the great 2011. A bit tighter. Nice, tight earthy leathery nose. On the palate lots of plummy ripe fruit, concentrated, dark chocolate, leather, smoky, spicy, dark. Young but enjoyable!"
19819,8967,"4.3 ⭐️ Delicious Douro. Deep ruby with shades of purple in glass. The nose is not very intense complex with hints of coffee, cloves, cherry, chocolate, plum, and a lot of other subtle notes that I can not even get, all entangled. Medium bodied, moderate acidity, dry, fine flannel texture. The taste gives notes of cherry and plum jam, chocolate, spices. Tannins are gentle and moderately lasting. Overall, a wine without strong distinguishing notes, but so well balanced that you take it as a whole. Amazing. "
19820,8967,"Iconic red. Full bodied, strong plum and blackberry flavour profiles."
19821,8967,"Excellent!4,3 Wednesday lunch at home..."

19825,8967,"Hmm, yes nice, but 80$? Its one of Niepoort's flagships, and compared with the other tasted from them the most matured. Nice deep red, a wonderful nose of black fleshy cherries, spices, smoke. On the palate deep, round, silky, warming, nice black fruits, spices, wood. Long aftertaste. Would be great to have a bottle decanted and to see how the wine opens up, great, but for 80$ i would go Spain or USA. Cheers "
19826,8967,"What a piece of art! Unobvious dark and dry tastes, somewhat oriental, as if smoked in incense. Earth, black olive and sweetness of overripe black fruit."
19827,8967,A great wine just a baby needs time to mature and get smoother 
19828,8967,Still one of my favourites
19829,8967,"Blend of Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz, Rufete and Malvazia. Floral aromas of lavender and hints of wood. Very aromatic, full body. Fine integrated tannins and long aftertaste."
19830,1267518,"Garrafeira a style initiated by Niepoort, lets say a kind of cross between ruby and tawny even if it is more tawny style -  this one was set in demi jonhs in 1982 and bottled in 2007 - Pure, clean and straight but a bit closed at beginning, a port wine that really needs time to open up - it is all about elegance, it still feels quite young and gets a beautiful freshness #PortWineDay  #winelover"
19831,1267518,"WOW! strong and heavy prunes, caramel, very mature. intense, bold ink. love it!"
19832,1267518,Great wine In combination with cheese and gelly pot!
19833,1267518,"So amazing, honied pralines and orange blossom, figs, tobacco, cherries, complex as hell with a length that goes for near eternity, a unique experience.  Had this at the end of a Niepoort dinner in the most incredible venue in Porto, Casa de Cha a Michelin star restaurant on the coast. Everything was delicious but this was the perfect end to a wonderful evening "
19834,1267518,"This port I must say was amazing! Decant it, alot of sedements in it. Still very good acidity! Plum offcourse! Had diffrent cheeses with it and it didnt let me down! But for me 1 glass is perfect, its still a sweet wine!  Did feel the alcohol aswell"
19835,1267518,"Heavy oak,plum,leather aroma, black fruit,  spicy"
19836,1267518,"96+/100 Aged 4 years in cask and the rest of the time in glass Demijohns. It’s in between a vintage and tawny style. Has the color of an aged Pinot Noir. Notes of red raspberry, sour cherry, garrigue, caramel, toffee, and even a touch of nuttiness. It’s extremely elegant for a Port and the alcohol isn’t burning. The fruit takes center stage here. This doesn’t bring the power of a Vintage Port nor the explosive nuttiness of a Tawny but it does bring complexity and length. It can cellar for many years. "
19837,1267518,"The best of two Worlds;  The Child of Madame Vintage and Senor Tawny.  Aged in Wood and Demijohn bottles.  Freshness, Complexity, in great harmony.  Just amazing.  No words, pure enjoyment. "
19838,1267518,"Great old port; lovely amber colour; not a very strong bouquet, but very impressive palate; caramel, sugar, dried prunes. Very long finish."
19839,1267518,"Amazing bottle! Layers of taste, plum and ripe prunes with subtle caramel and vanilla notes."
19840,1267518,Winey nose. Palate is clean and with honey flavors. Very precise.

19843,1830429,"Dark ruby-red color in the glass! On the nose aroma of blackberries, black cherry, tobacco and toasted aromas! On the palate fruity with light tobacco nuances, powerful minerals in combination with light tannins and a harmonious finish! Cheers!"
19844,1830429,Describe this as a fresh beast of a wine. This is day 2 ( we had at resto byob; we didn’t finish and I got the leftovers. 🙌) Amazing perkyness to this woman power winemaker of the year in 🇵🇹 red  🅰️licante bouschet 55% and 45% field blend. She found two old vineyards in 🅰️lentejo. She searched and said yep here.  Striking minerality to the blackness berries with zippy acidity. Tannins 😡 but forgiving with all the balance. Savoury with a rustic edge. Wet cement/ tar. Kinda 😎.  4.3 ⭐️  Oh whata night. 
19845,1830429,"Deep dark red color with medium legs and high viscosity. Aromas dried herbs, blackberries, plum and cigar box. High alcohol and a good acidity level for a 5 year old red wine. A sip of this brings straight back to the warm summer of the alentejo. "
19846,1830429,"Beautiful dark body.  Chocolate, coffee, plum, prune, jam,. Long finish"
19847,1830429,Need some time to mature

19849,1830429,"4.4 alentéjo , Alicante Bouchet dominates. Dark berries, cherry, blueberries, vanilla and licorice. Dark brooding wine with baking spices. Lovely"
19850,1830429,Flowery on the nose with a great dark red ruby colour! A bit dry all over withstrobg tannins! Full bodied with a very long strong finish! Layered with great depth! Very good wine regardless the young age! Would recomend it any day!
19851,1830429,Very nice blend of two typical Portuguese blends. Great intense aroma of ripe black fruits and on the palate dense blackberries turning to blackberry jam feel. All rounded by very silky tannins supported by fine cigar box flavour. Full bodied elegant and smart wine. Excellent with pieces of cheese and sausages.
19852,1830429,Lovely fresh fruit and wine! Clean and clear! Bravo!
19853,1830429,"Alicante Bouschet aged in used barrels during 18 months. Intense nose of ripe black fruits with delicate sweet spices hints. Patale is full bodied but well balanced by freshness that gives a second wave to the wine. Final is slightly tannic. Could age for several years without problem. 14,5/20."
19854,1830429,A first edition of this Portuguese Alentejo with red fruits and iodine in the nose. Full bodied and expressive with solid tannins and a fruity final.
19855,1830429,"Through the wood the bouquet is first soft, noble, sweet vanilla rising from the glass. This impression gives way to increasingly fresh fruit, now dominates the aroma of raspberries The body has a solid base of tannins and pronounced acidity. With his consistency, elegance and red fruit. It also shows a dark side, which increases its complexity, a delightful tangy flavor that balances the still-present wood. Without interruption following the strong aftertaste with tannin and acid, but also with fruit."
19856,1706502,"🇵🇹 Dense ruby color 👁. Jam of ripe plum, blackberry and black cherries 👃. Jam of blackfruits and soft tannins present with notes of dried grapes and spices in a long aftertaste 👄.

19857,1706502, plum pepper cherry raisin plum jam
19858,1706502,"Visual: dark ruby core, ruby halo, opaque because it is not filtered. Tears of medium legs, close and slow. Olfactory: dried black fruits in jam (plum, blackberry), raisin, honey. Palate: confirms the smell and delivers milk chocolate in the aftertaste, leather and wood. High intensity, high persistence, full-bodied, medium acidity, high alcohol, fine and soft tannins, very dry."
19859,1706502,"4,3 ⭐  including QPR. 3,8 ⭐  without QPR  Really really nice ""aged"" LBV from the perfect 2011 vintage!  Keep in mind that other vintages might not keep up to the quality of 2011.   one of my favourite LBVs so far.  The style is slightly elegant, but the wine is so animating, due to a really nice, perfect integrated acidity.  Kind of ""dry"" finish.  Reminds of of the Niepoort style.  For 17€, this is really fingerlicking good.     "
19860,1706502,"Port was my gateway into wine, it holds a special place within the swirling dark recesses of my heart.  This one is no exception. True to form, and stylistically sound. The usual suspects-plums, black cherries, mission figs, and raisins are all accounted for. They balance seamlessly with roasted nuts, fresh tobacco, and baking spice. The finish is rich and lingering-even if the tail is hotter then hell. "
19861,1706502, plum leather chocolate raisin
19862,1706502,"Velvety smooth ruby red, cassis, alcohol and tannins that mellowed after the second glass.  Young Peeppy and fruity "
19863,1706502,"Very enjoyable unfiltered LBV. 50% Touriga Nacional, 30% Touriga Francesa, 10% Tinta Roriz and 10% Tinto Cão. Five years in old wooden vats.  Interestingly, winemakers at the Decanter Spain/Portugal tasting were unanimous in recommending drinking unfiltered LBVs within 3-5 years of release.  Deep ruby. Nose of rich dark fruit, prune, liquorice and clove. The palate is spicy too, generous black and red cherry, plum, fig, soft medium tannins, with vibrant acidity. Drier than many LBVs, which suits my taste."
19864,1706502,"Another beautiful LBV port, always in my favorite value for money in port wines 😊🍷 plenty of character, and nice texture - elegant fruity notes and great freshness "
19865,1706502,"Nice, young, solid port. nothing spectacular. But with lots of life left in the bottle."
19866,1706502,"A very nice LBV port. Balanced, not too sweet, delicate bitter in the finish. The kind of port I can get used to...  Ripe dried fruits, herbs, caramel, raisins, nuts (for Dutch vivinisto's; 'studentenhaver'). Silky mouthfeel, soft, well structured. For €16,95 an excellent P/Q. 17 pts @ de wijnschuur."

19871,2415397,"Current August backlog. Not that great as the previous Esporão 2014 gem but very good for closing the Alentejo evening. Ruby red colour with quite intense aromas of again black fruits with distinguished notes of oak and vanilla, pepper, tar, clove, some whiffs of leather and truffles. Full-bodied on the palate with quite high acidity and also quite firm tannins being a great support for fruity-spicy flavours as plum, blackcurrant, raspberry with pepper, again vanilla and oak, licorice. Pleasant aftertaste."
19872,2415397,Dry but full flavored
19873,2415397,Nicer now (April 2021) than in May 2020. Cellar time helped to smooth the acidity note that was too dominant a year ago.
19874,2415397,"Celebrating National Drink Wine Day.  Trying another Portuguese Red wine. Delicious. Berries and dry fruit aroma, nice mouth feel, followed by a good tannin finish that lingers nicely. Definitely an enjoyable red wine."

Dark purple, spreading scents of ripe black fruit, dark plums, cassis and dates on a background of wild herbs, liquorice and peppery impressions.  Dense mouthfeel, packed with ripe fruit and balanced with a juicy acidity with some saltiness in the finish.   A nice expression of a warm climate red. 3,6*"
19879,2415397,"A blend from Alicante Bouschet, Syrah Touriga Franca/Nacional, 14.5% vol. Almost purple black, extremely dense, very slow & oily, little signs of aging.  Overripe fruit nose, port like, sweet spices, vanilla, plum, raisin, figues & dates, med+ intense, no alcoholic heat. Palate starts with present sweetness, but then juicy acidity & fine tannins make a good counterpart. Licquorice, ripe berries, very high concentration, silky mouthfeel. Very long finish. Comparable to 'Taberner'. Excellent! 90/100 - 4.0/5*"
19880,2415397,"A fruity blend of Syrah, Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional & Alicante bouschet shows ripe fruits and local herbs."

19889,45244,"Easy drinking blend, deep ruby color, red fruits and spices on nose. Medium bodied, soft tannins, medium finish.  Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Touriga França and Tinta Barroca. 15% aged for 6 months in oak barrels. 14% abv.  Rate 3.8"
19890,45244,"Almost, but not quite a 4.0 as it’s a bit young and rambunctious. Cherry, dark fruit, some spice and pepper, and a bit of oak. Solid quality a d value for the price. Perhaps a bit of time on its side would give it some mellow."
19891,45244,"🔠wine#57 just had to be a 🇵🇹 Vinho ✝️into from the Douro Valley with a blend of the indigenous varieties ✝️inta roriz, ✝️inta barroca, ✝️ouriga franca and ✝️ouriga nacional from Quinta do Crasto. Always a reliable favourite, it’s ruby red in colour with lots of juicy fruit flavours of blackberry, raspberry & black currant with soft mellow almost creamy tannin. Well balanced, medium to full in body, it’s a very easy to drink wine and would go well with lamb or beef. 3.9⭐️ is 🎯"

19893,45244,"Very little aroma leads you to expect a weak taste but the moment it touches the pallet it explodes with spices, lead by pepper and ginger. There is a subtle blackberry undertone. The finish has some strength with the spice and a slight metallic tone. Allow to breath for around 40 minutes for best flavour balance."
19894,45244,"A youthful blend of Douro 🍇 varieties, Touriga National, Tina Roriz, Touriga Franca & Tinta Barocca.

19926,80426,96pts me Consistent with my previous score of this particular bottle.   A south facing vineyard at the Douro River with a chapel dedicated to the saint mary   Massive big wine initially tight on a nose open with incredible amount of mulberry cassis and sweet cream of cherry. You can smell the French oak yet the wine is so powerful. There's also that hint of grappa green making it balanced and grounded  This bottle will age another 20 + year silky smooth tannin already yet you can chew on the wine 
19927,80426,"LADY OF THE RIVER  Named for the chapel neighboring the Quinta, the schist soil has low yields which are trodden in the old style.

Rubi red color medium plus intensity, with soft and elegant aromas of younger fresh vibrant red fruit, bit of black berries with floral spring under tone! Nothing out of place or dominant of a medium plus mouthfeel, minerality in first place, such addictive smooth tanins... It's somehow chewy but still elegant...

19954,6342192,"Pure one litre of fun! Juicy red wine from Portugal. Less extracted, shorter maceration and less mess. Unfiltred, unfined, low volume of sulphur and unusual 12% of alcohol!   82/100  Hints of  raspberry strawberry red fruit earthy cranberry cherry pepper blackberry smoke."
19955,6342192,"Considering this is an $18, 1L bottle of wine, the quality/price ratio is absurdly high.  Such great balance, with delicious minerality, red fruit, and a little spice.  Fresh acidity, and a long finish.  A great value, and the perfect wine to have laying around. "
19956,76372," Boy did I enjoy this one. Nothing like a great port along side a ridiculous chocolate cake for desert. Dried fruit,nutty and spicy. A winner. "
19957,76372,Dark yellow brandy colour. Rich and utterly on the palate with a touch of sherry saltiness. Honey and marmalade flavours. Long and persistent aftertaste.
19958,76372,"Wow, hard to find a better port than this. An explosion of oak, caramel, raisin and figs. Armchair in front of an open fire in Winter time or on the terrace a warm night in Portugal "

19968,76372,"Tawny, in particularly Colheita, have a special place for me. Complexity, enjoyment and value in one.   Nosel: Burnt caramel, dried sweet alcoholic cranberries, smokey meaty underbelly, glazed nuts.  Pal: Essence of maturity, off-dry, more sweet baked cranberries and raisins with baking spice and potpourri. More glazed nuts and Christmas fruit cake.   Fin: Refreshing acidity and balanced alcoholic kick, with a vivid sweet cured meat and spicy cranberry compote.  Excellent."
19969,76372,"Walnuts and berries on the nose leading to a luscious palate with chocolate notes mingled with figs, treacle, molasses, jammy berries and almonds. The back is long, lingering with vanilla, dessicated cherries, espresso and singed almonds. This is excellent."

19986,1164787,"I enjoyed the 2015 Cedro so much that I jumped at the chance to try the 2016 last month, at Quinta do Noval's lovely tasting room on the Gaia waterfront. More Touriga Nacional in 2016, and less oak. However it smells and tastes pleasingly similar to the 2015, with the oak actually more obvious at this younger stage. Purple. Fruity wine, bramble, blueberry, plum, with violets and smoky oak. Fresh and mineral on the palate, a little riper than 2015, earth, chocolate, spice. Full body, high acidity. Great!"
19987,1164787,"an interesting one, big black licorice on palate but the exciting part is the long finish, mellowing to vanilla and caramel  "
19988,1164787,Plenty of personality with delicious dark fruit notes - blackberry on the nose with lovely balance and a hint of oak and vanilla.

20001,9000,"Aroma Pronounced aroma of stone fruit (Peach), citrus (grapefruit, lemon), green fruit (apple, pear). Floral (blossom).  Flavour Dry, with high acidity, body is medium+ with medium- alcohol. Flavour intensity is stone fruit (Peach), citrus (grapefruit, lemon), green fruit (apple, pear). There are other notes of minerality and salinity. Finish is long and savoury. A great wine with a long future."
20002,9000,Subtle purity with low alcohols.dry but still fruity.
20003,9000,"This is big without high alcohol, it’s 11% but there is nothing feeble here. Rich and full, the mouthfeel is gorgeous and the lick of oak is spot on. Citrus acidity keeps the rich apricot and honey in check, as does the minerality, this wine is not flabby. Jolly good stuff, Mr H is desiring grilled sardines, I simply desire another glass."
20004,9000,"Yoghurt, baking spices, piece of bread&butter.  I’m not a huge fan of that type aroma.  But the taste is much more on my side. Silky, with waking up acidity and nice structure.  Classic one, reminds me godello with fermentation in oak.   90/100"
20005,9000,"Excellent white, but be prepared for a fight to open the bottle! The nose has some butter and minerality. Good balance of acidity and dryness. A hint of stone fruit (apricot finish). Pairs great with fish but it's light enough to drink solo. "
20006,9000,"Deliciously fresh with lemon zest, greengage, pungent green herbs, and a softening touch of honey. Superb with seafood; in this case fried squid and grilled Dover Sole. Another cracker from Dirk Niepoort. Packs a powerful punch for 11% ABV: persistent, linear, and balanced are adjectives that spring to mind."
20007,9000,Good light medium balanced body 
20008,9000,"This was Jura-like oxidative style Chardonnay. Not what I was expecting, but very good"
20009,9000,"Excellent wine, a joy to drink it"
20010,9000,"When first opened, the nose leads with a pure, bright aroma of vanillin. But after 15 min this had faded to the background and given way to and interesting mix of minerals and stone fruit.  The palate has tart green apples, grapefruit and a lot of salinity, which lingers together with the acidity through a long finish.  This is a good wine but I found the acidity a bit overpowering. For a wine in this price class I'd like the acidity to be better integrated. "
20011,9000,"Nice fruit (fresh stone fruit, yellow apple, ripe pear ). Good freshness & minerality. Mid body nice finish. Good wine but less complexity than expected."
20012,9000,Nice White from N-Portugal Made from an unknown local Grape.  Citrus and green Herbs with a super Minerality. 
20013,9000,Good bite. Light bitterness and good tang at once. Great with fat food.
20014,9000,Oh so delicate.

20025,81371,"The last wine in today’s tasting course. Spicy and intense with cherry, vanilla, baking spices and chocolate notes."
20026,81371,"4,0⭐️ 2014 Late Bottled Vintage Unfiltered Port, Quinto Do Noval Without notes"
20027,81371,Yummy w/ chocolate cake!! Not as syrupy as other ports 
20028,81371,"Really good LBV. Ruby, fruit, sweet. It has it all 🇵🇹"
20029,81371,Straight away I said ‚chocolate‘. That was followed by mellow hints of vanilla and fruit. Very nice indeed. 
20030,81371,"Deep ruby color, cherry, vanilla and chocolate. "
20031,1493141,"Young cherry light oak bright overall with soft tannins and some allspice on the finish, it’s beautiful, a real winner for me"
20032,1493141,"Smoke and plum on the nose. Lovely full palate with cherry and bramble giving way to licorice, oak and vanilla. A very creditable Douro red."
20033,1493141,Soft Smoke and flowers on the nose.  Plum and blueberry on the tongue.  Soft and velvety on the palette.   I love this wine!!  I will definitely get this again. 
20034,1493141,"Good young douro, ripe black fruit mixed with red fruit notes such as cherry with flowers and smoky oak on the nose too. Medium tannins and low acidity."
20035,1493141,This is a very good Douro red wine. Very present mature fruity notes likje prunes and almonds. In the mouth is long and soft with hardly any acidity notes. A great buy with a budget price. 
20036,1493141,"A flavoursome Douro blend of Tourigas Nacional and Franca with Tinta Roriz. The six  months ageing in used oak has softened the brambly fruit and tannins into a mellow, fruit-forward and most drinkable wine that finishes with a touch of liquorice sweetness. Easy to like "
20037,1493141,"On, if pretty easy-going & simple for a Douro. Dark, with dark fruits. Chocolate raspberry. Proper, but sweet-fruited. A long—if very low-volume—finish. This 2017 is fully-mature. Food wine, from beef soft tacos (tonight) to steak. 3.8 woofs is correct. Always a value."
20038,1493141,"Aromas of dark fruit, a tiny bit funky, vanilla, crushed rock, mint and floral.  Tastes of Black fruit, blackberries, blueberries, raspberry, some red fruit, and dark chocolate.   Mouth coating texture, big firm tannins, medium to long finish.  3.9"
20039,1493141,"3.9⭐️  👁 Medium purple color.   👃🏻 Floral, ripe red fruit ane balsamic notes on the nose.  👄 Smooth mouthfeel with vibrant ripe red fruit attack, lovely acidity with a firm finnish with well integrated tannins. "
20040,1493141,"Love the quality price ratio , definitely a food friendly wine , lots of acidity , tannins are present but not overpowering the balance. Lots of red fruit  and dark fruit , raspberry , violet flowers , a touch of green vegetables , oak , a finish on res fruits . Would pair with a board of charcuteries , a smoked chorriZo  and beans !"
20041,1493141,"Quite nice everyday Douro, easy to drink, soft and smooth for my taste, not the gold standard but exceedingly decent. "
20042,1493141,Fresh and intense. Nice fruit. Sooth with a semi-dry finish.
20043,1493141,"Subtle notes of oak/ vanilla on the nose. Very elegant, smooth. I think this is a great wine."
20044,1493141,"Very young. Red fruit, cherry and plum. Moderate acidity, high tanins, moderate finish."
20045,1493141,83/100. Impressive considering the price. Well done. Good vintage. Cheers 
20046,1185659,84/100 Amber color oxidative but not too much dry fruits dry nuts prune served chilled is really something special!!! Perfect with prune tart
20047,1185659,"Ahhh Porto! We cannot wait to go to Portugal next Easter (2015) and have plenty of it.   This one offers a very interesting robe, dark copper or light chocolate, it has a nice caramel pitch. Refined leather hints comes along to lift you above the end of Iberia. Marvellous!"
20048,1185659,"From the ""oldest British Port House"" (1670), this little beauty was recommended to us by Sean at the local wine merchant.  Caramel aromas with sugared walnut and plum flavours. Gorgeous! It is apparently great chilled and is sitting in the fridge, preparing itself for tomorrow's tasting!"
20049,1185659,"This was a leap of faith but you won’t know if you never take a chance!  Lighter density for a tawny port but an awesome amber/ruby color; it still keeps an overall moderate density regardless.    There’s a refined, savoy aspect that’s hard to describe but, overall, it reminds me of a an elegant 10 year tawny port.  Nutty undertones to velvety layers of dried figs, lightly candied cherry and red plums unfold with a velvety texture.  Dusting of exotic spices accents a decent length tops it off."
20050,1185659,"Fantastic unique tawny Porto!  I’ve never had a tawny like this, but I was enamored. Smooth and silky, but the oxidative notes take a back seat, with red floral and bright cherry taking the front, followed by caramel and toffee notes in the background. Feminine and quite pretty. Now I want to try the 20 year..."
20051,1185659,"👀 Medium tawny 👃 Medium(+) intensity with aromas are of dried cranberry, caramel, hazelnut, and tobacco 👅 The wine is sweet with medium(+) acidity, medium(+) tannin, high alcohol, and medium(+) body. Pronounced flavor intensity and a long finish. The flavors are of dried cranberry, caramel, and tobacco 🧠 The wine is very good. Not suitable for bottle aging."
20052,1185659,"Now this is a nice treat. Needs, like most ports, to be served cold. Quite closed initially but opens up beautifully in your mouth. Quite refined with a lovely finish. Lighter than most ports I've had I'll date, but seems more balanced and complex. "
20053,1185659,"Pale amber/tawny with a residual hint of red. The nose is fantastic with pronounced intensity of dried fruits (sultana and raisin), cooked strawberry & slight medicinal hints of iodine, tar & cough mixture. Distinctive oak with sweet vanilla spice. Palate is lusciously sweet with rich velvety smooth dried fruits (candied peel, raisin, sultana, prune, fig), juicy freshening med+ acidity, high alcohol with a distinctive warming glow & sweetness that is perfectly balanced by the rich fruit & acidity. Excellent"
20054,1185659,"CALLING ALL PORT MINIONS !!!  Nothing like relaxing with some Port by the fire. I haven't had tawny lately, but it's an old friend and the most difficult to make. Just a few drops from another aged barrel can completely alter the texture!  The nose is a Portuguese invasion, hitting me from 4 feet away! And the familiar notes came one after the other. Caramel, figs, crushed nuts & sweet spices. I savored this for hours. The perfect nightcap!"
20055,1185659,"Pretty red orange color fading to a thin clear meniscus with toffee, baked red fruits, roast coffee and honey aromas. On the palate it medium-bodied and rich with baked cherry and raspberry, toffee and honey flavors. Medium long finish. Bottled in 2012. Wonderful pairing with a chocolate chip cookie"
20056,1185659,"Serve chilled. A great way to enjoy port when you've already consumed a fair amount, thus sparing you the usual savage port hangover."
20057,1185659,"Beautiful orange color very bright. On the nose: tobacco, almond, caramel. Mouth is velvety but still fresh with a nice acidity. Very walnut. Long "
20058,1185659,"A classic 10 year old Port. On the nose, compote, jam and vanilla. In the mouth, it's a mix of blackberry, caramel, minerals, toffee. "
20059,1185659,"Amber red. Strawberry, prune, raisin. A little too tart and not enough complexity/finish to be considered a higher quality tawny."
20060,1185659,"Complex nose of almond, pecan, white pepper and some dried banana.    White raisin and jammy fig on the palate with an oaky aftertaste "
20061,1211398,Hhhmmmm. Difficult. There is Very good italian and french Wine    I dont know where to place it  Dry and a medium long aftertaste 
20062,1211398,"Tobacco, light leather, rather plumish than cherries. Actually quite light despite the chalky notes on the palate. Lovely. Can easily be stored for 6 more years"
20063,1211398,"The Robustus 2013 is a mirror image of the Duero Region in its whole splendor. Flavors of blackcurrant, dark plum, used leather, cigar tobacco, sweet old balsamic vinegar, dark chocolate, smoke, slate and grilled herbs can be detected on both the nose and the palate. Impressing precision, freshness and minerality showing here. Despite its fullness and complexity presenting a considerable harmony. With fine grained, delicate tannins , finishes with a lasting length of tension and pressure!"
20064,1211398,"Lovely, maturing and bursting with fruit. Tannins are very smooth and there is still a decent level of acidity present. Bucket loads of blackberries, red cherries, black cherries and raspberries with some smidgins of chocolate and coffee. There are some tertiary fruit flavours but this still has some way to go. Long length"
20065,1211398,"Great example of Douro 🤩🍷 real beauty and it’s the wine that loves to age in your cellar before you open it... Tobacco, ripe cherries, smooth tannins... a big boy very elegant "
20066,1211398,"92/100 This has resisted aging. Red cherry, strawberry, cramberry, and tobacco. Medium bodied with firm tannins. Well balanced and long finish. This is juicy and food friendly, surprisingly elegant for a Douro red."
20067,1211398,Wonderful wine - full body and hints of mulberry and licorice with some acidic tones. Great balance. Some spice and nice finish. 
20068,1211398,balanced with a long final...never disappoints 🍷
20069,1211398,"Charme, the most elegant red wine I've tasted."
20070,1211398,"🌍🍇  Amazing Douro Red  blend produced by the Niepoort winery. 💪👀  Full bodied with 13.5% vol.and deep ruby color. 👃 Notes of black fruit, chocolate and tobacco.  👅 Palate is dry with great acidity, velvet tannins, some spicy feeling and long aftertaste. ⏳ Great aging potential Love it."
20071,1211398,"The first wine Dirk ever made. This dad said it was crap,  but it's just a gorgeous,  full-bodied,  rather tannic wine that needs te develop.  An 11-year wait does the job 😋🙃. We enjoyed it a lot.  "
20072,1211398,"A WOW wine. Just bought  because I didn't know the wine and wanted to try. I didn't had big expectations but from the first touch I was in love. Incredible noise , red fruit, little touch of oak and in the mounth not heavy, pencil , perfect balanced with nice acidity in the aftertaste. A blend of Touriga with other local grapes. I expected a heavy alcoholic fruit bomb and got a well balanced gracious wine."
20073,1211398,"Excellent Douro red! This classic from Niepoort, with good age but still growing, is a rich blend from old vines, with T. Franca, T. Roriz, T. Amarela, T. Nacional and others, aged 42m in large oak casks. Bold, complex and deep, with vivid acidity and great length.  Ruby color, floral, dark fruits aromas/flavors, specially black currant and plum, with notes of spices, mint, cedar, toast, an hint of coffee and beautifully integrated oak. Full body, silky tannins and a terrific lingering finish. Splendid!"
20074,1211398,Wild berrys with chocolate notes on the nose. Great complexity with tannins with good structure. Some herbal notes showing on the mouth. It will be wonderfull with a couple more years on the bottle...
20075,1211398,Such a good wine!
20076,1369907,Indeed the right value is 3.7.
20077,1369907,A pale golden color.  Medium intensity fruits aromas.  Dry and medium acidity level.  High alcohol content and medium body.   Medium intensity green apple flavors and a secondary peaches tones.  Medium finishing.

20082,1369907,"Happy Weekend #1  Branco from Portugal 🥂🇵🇹👍🏻  Medium body, fine tropical Fruit structure with a fresh and crisp acidity. Nice one - more intense and intresting then vinho verde. I like 👍🏻"
20083,1369907,"Pale lemon with pronounced aroma. Apple,  apricot, pear, mirabelle plum, wet stone and hint of grass. Medium acidity, medium alcohol give medium body. Rich, well stuctured palate with medium plus finish. "

20085,1369907,Beautiful wine very refreshing 
20086,1369907,"A light nose of honey and melon.  Melon and peach flavours.  Dry.  Med bodied & finish.  Reminded me of an Albariño with the med body, but this elicited strange looks and disagreement from the experts. :)"
20087,1369907,Like it😁😁😁  Very spritz!!  Really good for summer!!   Not heavy but matches with all kind of food.   2020.08.06 with Hwang and BJ
20088,1369907,Great pool wine. Easy drinking at top level. 
20089,1369907,"An actual tropical fruit salad, passion fruit and pineapples, while being neither dessert sweet nor Sauvignon Blanc dry. Just delightful"
20090,1369907,Very smooth and light color...crystal clear. In the nose is tropical in the mouth is full a bit sweet but balanced on the acid...funny vanilla in the end.
20091,1708163,"A dark ruby red, bold and full-bodied wine with hints of skoke and pencil shavings.  The finish is perfect due to the lovely tannins."
20092,1708163,"Blackberry, casis,  and dark chocolate on the nose.  Jammy casis and blueberry on the tongue with a long finish that leaves a pleasing touch of memorable acidity. An interesting blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesa, Tannat, Tinto Cao,  Trincadeira, and Syrah.  Paired with curried lamb and lightly curried vegetables (potatoes,  celery,  onion, chickpeas,  peas, and  green peppers). Lots of sediment due to unfiltered nature of wine. A delightful wine purchased at the winery south of Lisbon in Nov 2018."
20093,1708163,"I gotta say this wine reflects the best of what I like from Douro. Bold, complex, dark fruit nose and balanced tannins. "
20094,1708163,Leather and dark fruits in the nose that prepare you to a very balanced sweat blackberry. Deep flavour. A wine that aged beautifully. 
20095,1708163,Smoth abd lovely
20096,1708163,"Powerful red, the best in the region. Dark berries, eccentric flavor. Excellent. "
20097,1708163,Beautiful blueberry nose. Nice acids and oh so soft tannins. Could wait another 5 y
20098,1708163,"This 2009 José Maria Da Fonseca Hexagon tinto is one of the regarded premium table wines in Portugal. Served blind to friends and everyone was confused. I had to admit this wine is rather perplexing to taste, especially in blind.  Blend of 6 grapes (hence Hexagon) of Portuguese grapes as well as Syrah and Tannat from 2 ha vineyard. Ripe jammy red fruits, blueberry, violet, smoked Italian cask smell and a fair chunk of structured tannins and oak. It almost taste like a super Tuscan.  86/100"
20099,1708163,"Very elegant wine. Complex and matured, harmonious and long in aftertaste. The flavours are of red cherry, blueberry, dark chocolate, vanilla and spices."
20100,1708163,"Dark ruby colour, with a startinh nose of green apple and caramelized apple, very surprising, after a while it changes into something heavier, and starts getting the oak, and the black fruits. With a strong intensity taste, very heavy, at the begining it has a lot of red fruits and a bit of leather and afterwards vegetation, with bell peppers and all the spice pallet, from white to black pepper, powerfull wine like i like it, medium high acidity, strong tannins and dry. Medium long finish."
20101,1708163,"Take time to enjoy the depth of the aromas. Lots of time. Benefits from some breathing, say 15 minutes or more. Dark berry, light tannins and smooth. Decent length - but not extraordinary - finish. You will not be disappointed if you like smooth but well bodied reds. Paired very well with veal carpaccio (which had a recognizable saltiness). "
20102,1708163,"It an (very) rare occasion when i rate a wine over the score on vivino, this one opens in 15 min and evolves constantly. The nose hints its a great wine, well balanced, excellent acidity and a long complex finish.  Will revisit. (revisited in April, its a great wine)"
20103,1708163,The nose on this is outstanding. Incredible. It's also dark like chocolate very good. However the taste doesn't do the nose justice and at 50€ a bottle not value for money based on the taste not the nose!
20104,1708163,Great and very complete blend from Setúbal.  Nose 17/20 Mouth 15/20 Colour and Tear 18/20 End of Mouth 14/20
20105,1708163,"Deep black fruit, flint, charcoal, smoke, liquorice and dried herb on the nose. High acidity and fine tannins on the palate. Would handle a few more years in bottle."
20106,1787751,"Good flavors and aromas of fruit (black fruit and red fruit). Pleasant slight bitter (black chocolate). Ruby / violet color. Full-bodied, medium dry. Overall, on the olfactory / gustatory dimension it`s a pleasant wine. Alcohol in the level 14.°, which, for me, is too much for table wine and a less gastronomic aspect. Contains sulphites.  "
20107,1787751,Big blackberry but hints of lavender and orange peel. Acids nice and high with pronounced violet and blueberries on palate. 
20108,1787751,2017 need to wait a bit and its gonna be great

20112,1787751,A hint of boysenberry with vanilla and wood undertones. Low tannins. Good with food.  CW. 
20113,1787751,A tasting sample only but enough fruit concentration and some complexity to warrant buying a bottle or two.  Great value for money

20115,1787751,"Beautiful aromas, smooth on the pallet."

20118,1787751,"Young and fruity. Open and do not drink at ones. Wait 30 minutes. It is getting better and better. Not an easy wine to drink. Not long not woody not a barrel wine. Sousao grape does something interesting with dull and acid  Touriga nacional grape. Enjoy.....after 30 minutes: fantastic acidity, great fruits, super elegant. No horrible oak or vanilla."
20119,1787751,"Pleasant, fruity with plenty of red berries and some liquorice. Correct amount of acidity and with a good portion of tannins to keep this young rebel under control.3,1⭐️"
20120,1787751,"Powerful, solid, intoxicating, very mature, complex, dense and contentrated, strong tannins. Special wine hard to forget. Mature red fruit with eucaliptus notes. Hands up. "

20124,1708163,"TE:  Good, not great.  Bit flat.  -They did say it needs a lot of  time to open up.  LT: But more tannins and less acidity.  "
20125,1708163,3.9 Elegant and fresh
20126,1708163,At the vineyard during my stay in Lisbon. Great flagship wine from this great producer. A wine with a nice story behind. Seek it out!
20127,1708163,Aromatic and spicy. 5-spice powder citrus cherry 
20128,1708163,"Deep garnet hue. Big blackberry / black plum aroma, with a slight woody funk to it. Full bodied, medium tannin and acidity, and then vanished on the finish. Nice, but somewhat overpriced."

20133,1708163,"Its an inexpensive good value wine, but not exceptional."
20134,1708163,"Mineral, steely, dark fruit and a bit of forest floor. Strong acids and tannins even though quite old. Lots of blackcurrant on palate. Elegant, smooth and streamlined. "
20135,1708163,"Very complex and fantastic bouquet with mocca, leather, boiled vegetables, spices and dark fruit. Powerful fruity taste with dry smooth tannins and lingering acidity."

20137,2258813,"Nose of dried raisins and a hint of brown sugar. Fresh, acidic, bitter and really not that sweet. Quite good but in a dryer, tighter style. 89-91p+"
20138,2258813,"Re-taste of this very good Dalva Colheita Porto vintage 1991, and the second half of the bottle was as good as the first part enjoyed several weeks ago !! Notes fully identical with sweet-acid caramel, oak, vanilla, dried fig and raisin. And a long, long finish !! Enjoy by itself or with a nice piece of chocolate cake !!"
20139,2258813,"Quite good Colheita with good age, but I guess I had expected more from this one  😜"
20140,2258813,"Full body port, nose of apples and plums, body of plums and fruit. Tried the 1990 vintage also and it’s a notch better."

20150,2258813,"Excellent port. Pale red-brown color. Perfect balance with smooth and round tannins. Palate shows raisin, caramel, oak, dried fruit and nutty."
20151,3334065,Golden yellow color with a summer fruit nose like pear and fig. Mineral start with a nice dry finish. Pairs with all seafood especially with crustaceans. Also great as an aperitif in the summer
20152,3334065,"Very well structured. Dry and austere to begin with, but new flavours of tropical fruit emerge followed by fig and chestnut. Enjoyable. "
20153,3334065,"So delicate and well balanced. Almost a hint of elderberry. Great with cheese, or by it self on a Nordic summer night. "
20154,3334065,classy wine superb with molten goat cheese
20155,3334065,"Very delicate, crisp wine. Lemon zest. Pairs well with sheep’s cheese"

A fresh and summery palate with smooth and round structure, balanced fresh acidity, cleansing fruity and pleasantly bitter finish. Refreshing on its own or have it along grilled or steamed halibut or black cod, scallops, salmon tartar, pasta vongole."
20157,3334065,"Great white Dão, outstanding effort by Niepoort. His best dry white in my opinion is the Coche but this comes close."
20158,3334065,"It’s been too long since my last Niepoort and this didn’t disappoint! Solid 4* (RP92)  Old vines (~100yr)  Aromatic and somewhat fruit forward. Good depth. Blackberry and bramble. Peppery spice.  H acidity. M+ tannins. Long tail and slightly mouth-drying, but still delish."
20159,3334065,"3.9*, at Brasserie Julie. Nice and dry. Matched with some Belgian caviar to celebrate our son’s 16th birthday. The sommelier actually initiated him in tasting wine ! "
20160,3334065,"I really liked that one, the nose gave me riesling vibe, you get petroleum and a loooot of lemon on the nose, but then the texture is huge with a smooth mouthfeel and a lovely finish"
20161,3334065,"3.9! La Grande Dégustation de Montréal! Very interesting Portuguese white that made think of the Loire Valley!  Minerals, lemon, saline, melon and pear all around. Medium finish. Very good."
20162,3334065,"Fresh and elegant, next to maturing on oak. In combination with ravioli of Portugese sheap cheese, spinach and sage butter a wonderful combination."
20163,3334065,"Elegant with fresh aromas of citrus, grapefruit with subtle oak aromas and vibrant acidity. Very nice bottle evolution and pleasant fresh finish"
20164,3334065,"Old vines and granite soils. Blend of indigenous varieties, including Malvasia, Encruzado and Bical Fermented in concrete tanks and aged in old oak barrels for 20 months with no batonage  Light gold colour On the nose, citrus, acacia flowers, honey, wet stone minerality  Vibrant and lively, but with a weighty and creamy mouthfeel Hint of smoke Green apples, quince, honey Lemon zest, white grapefruit  Herbal Touch of raw almonds  Lots of steely minerality  Long, pithy finish  Delicious!"

20166,1166991,"Alphabet Saturday a day early! @[1|16425004|Vita in Vinum] @[1|463609|KK] !   In vinho verde we trust! Gorgeous summer sipper, spritely, citrus, green apple, tangerine and fun! "
20167,1166991,"Opened at simple lunch. Smells of lime and la bit of yeast to my surprise. Pale straw yellow with greenish tilt. Fizzy, fresh and quite dry taste of lemon peal and green apple. Quality Vinho Verde as I had an expectation after experience with their rosé. 3.7"
20168,1166991,"Screw top. Nice and young label art, with a clove drawing that gives the name to the wine. Intense yellow color, signs of minerality on the eye, some carbonate, fast to no legs. Decent nose, old notes, some citrus - especially for lime zest and lemon zest, apricot, tropical fruit - especially for pineapple and mango. It is a blend of 3 Portuguese gapes, more on the bitter and acid side, loads of citrus - especially for bitter lemon and orange zest, good character, refreshing but better for paring with fish."
20169,1166991,"This is my go-to white wine. It's crisp, refreshing and delicious. Not to mention an excellent QPR. Citrusy, with enough minerality to keep it interesting. A fizzy and crisp finish with gooseberry, pippin apple and pineapple peel seal the deal."
20170,1166991,Nice wine for drinking during summer time. Crispy fresh citrus aroma and tastes. Enjoyable.

20174,1166991,Close to being a winner. Had a bit of an odd aftertaste 
20175,1166991,"Young, fresh, initially even slightly spicy (guess it came from malolactic fermentation taking place in the bottle) typical fizzy nature of."

20184,76416,"Pale lemon-green with pronounced aroma and delicate fizz. Peach, pear, pineapple, apple, lime and grass. Medium plus acidity, low alcohol give medium body. Fresh and intense palate with long finish."
20185,76416,"Easy drinking. Smells fruity, citrus notes. Tastes a little fizzy, notes of melon, lemon with a balanced lime on the finish. Very refreshing. 4.5 Euro from Aldi in Portugal. Go buy, fantastic value."
20186,76416,"Nose: pear, apricot, lime Mouth: lemon, grapefruit, pear Structure: light, high acidity and minerality (salty?), a touch of sweet. Slight effervescence. Finish: dry, long aftertaste."
20187,76416,"Very crisp, light, refreshing, drinkable vinho verde....almost too drinkable, as it dissapears faster than you would expect 😉 being slightly sparkling, reminds of apple cider, just be careful, it's a bit stronger! Aromas of apple, elderflower, peach and pineapple. Some minerals too and pleasantly acidic. "
20188,76416,"What am I to say? This is really very good Vinho Verde. Truly recommend to try, especially the price is more than better 😀  👃 green apple citrus pear lime apple lemon minerals pineapple melon peach stone honey   👅 good acidity, appropriate citrus finish  🛒 local shop B."
20189,76416,"Very good Vinho Verde. On the nose - apples, white peach, apricot, lime. On the palate - white peach, nectarine, ripe apples, lime. Gently fizzy. Pleasant citrusy aftertaste. Fruity, smooth and fresh. Went well with salmon pasta. "
20190,76416,"My first vinho verde! Slightly carbonated but the bubbles diffuse fairly quickly. A light straw colour rather than green as the name suggests 😆 smells of honeydew melon 🍈 green apple 🍏 and lime. Low acid for a white wine which surprised me. Very fresh, reminds me of the Mediterranean 🏝 I paired it with a falafel wrap and Greek salad 🥗 "
20191,76416,"Dry slightly fizzy but very fruity medium-to-light bodied wine with medium acidity. Color: Medium lemon yellow with greenish undertones Nose: mix of tropical fruits on the nose, medium intensity On the palate: pineapple, mango, green apple, some grapefruit Short finish which adds peach and stone notes. I didn't have high expectations for this wine, but its fruitiness wasn't aggressive, so it went really easy."
20192,76416,"🇵🇹 first vinho verde. Very nice :) especially with salmon omnomnom. Green apple at 1st nose, intensive melon in 2nd. Nice bubbles. Taste isn't strong and intensive..it's soft and easy drinkable for daily dinners or sunny chillout ;) "
20193,76416,"Nose: Green apple, lemon, minerals, soft pineapple, orange, vanilla, butterscotch   Palate: Juicy… Slightly dry finish  Overall: 4.1 excellent!"

20196,1189352,"Nose quite close with jam, fruits and alcohol. Taste combines fruit tones with honey and raisins, strawberry and cardamom."
20197,1189352,"Beautiful ruby color. Beautifully complex nutty nose, rich cherry, deep. Great with chocolate. "
20198,1189352,"86 pt. Soft and mellow. Distinguished porto, not too sweet"
20199,1189352,Retesting. Previous TN stands.
20200,1189352,"Great port. Not the dark reddish port you would expect, and a bit cloudy. Probably caused by a loose cork, which went directly into the bottle. "
20201,1189352,Could easily wait 5-10 years more as it is not as smooth as it could be.
20202,1189352,Perfect port for enjoying new year celebration
20203,1189352,"Honey, dark fruit, raisins, communion."
20204,1189352,"Translucent rich red, smooth, balanced "
20205,1189352,"Was lucky to try this 36 years old port. Slightly oxidized upon opening but surely interesting. 15 mins after opening, aromas started to develop. Amber, incense, spices, dried raisin. "
20206,1189352,"Cork damaged 😰. I should buy myself one of those fancy twin-prong cork puller. After initial worry about wine quality and after one hour breathing this Port revealed all its power. Ruby opaque, somewhat spoiled. Incredible aromas of raspberries marmalade, tobacco, dried figs, pepper, balsamic hints. Sweet sip is supported by an unexpected freshness. Incredibly long, several minutes, with a so pleasant aftertaste that either you walk away or you cannot do without pouring again and again. "
20207,1189352,No notes taken.
20208,1189352,"Strong dates and damson flavours with caramel and a little nutrients.. Smooth, sweet (but certainly not over sweet), luxurious lasting finish."
20209,1189352,"A Portwine from my birthyear had to be awesome. Cork came out intact!. Very interesting nose with raisins, dry plum, nuts, caramel, christmas spices, bitter orange and black bread. The finish is long, warm, spicy and a bit alcoholic. Loved it."
20210,1189352,"Eye: Light ruby red colour. Nose: Red honey. Mouth: Round & soft with a good harmony between sweetness and age. A fantastic bottle, with a fast end."
20211,7101275,"100% Syrah.  Violaceous, both in colour and aroma.  Generous fruit, blackberry and blueberry.  This has a really lovely mineral Douro character, which was good to find in a variety not often grown in the region.  Soft palate, bright acidity.  Black cherry, peppery spice, and a bit of mocha.  Very good indeed, and will of course improve.  Perhaps a bit expensive.  3.75*.  Decanter Fine Wine Encounter November 2019."
20212,7101275,"Friendly, classy and charming 😊🍷 proper exemple of Syrah potential in the Douro valley "
20213,7101275,Decanter London Spanish and Portuguese wine tasting event 2020.  Very pleasant but lightweight wine.  It’s definitely Syrah as opposed to Shiraz!!  🍷🍷🍷🍷
20214,7101275,"Deep ruby colour. Aromas of blackberries,licorice, sweet spice, meaty and salty. On the palate medium acidity,medoum+alcohol and body, tannins are there but ripe, finish is long. Super juicy and tasty, good value for money."
20215,7101275,Amazing   Dark fruit black currant blackberry cherry oak cinnamon nutmeg 
20216,7101275,Fruity but thin. Peppery finish.
20217,7101275,Very solid 4.2. Great fruit. Full bodied. Gets so far better with every year more in the  cellar. 
20218,7101275,"🇵🇹 Port producer having a go at Syrah - have a feeling it will become something but for drinking today I’d leave it.  👁 Deep Ruby  👃 Moderate intensity with some typical Syrah notes including black pepper and some meatiness but not as complex as I’d hope for the £££. I don’t know this wine but supposing bottle age may help.  👄 Medium + body, fairly well balanced but not too fruity or interesting at this point though clearly a well made wine. Préfères their 100% Petite Verdot."
20219,7101275,"Complex, very graphite / pencil shavings & slate dominant. Quite closed on first taste. Tasted better on day three, cherry & plum notes were able to show. "
20220,7101275,"19 year old vines, 10mths in French oak, black cherries, some brambly fruit. Spicy with some herbal backbone. Good example of still wine from the Douro."

20222,7101275,Dark and red fruits so lots going on. Plenty of oak for a rounded finish. Exceptional

20225,7101275,"From one of Douro’s most venerable Port producers, this flashy Syrah is an odd sample of Portuguese single-variety reds. WE94, JS93. 4.1*"
20226,3334018,"Last bottle 😢 Nice, comple nose with spicy notes and hints of oak and licorice.   Fresh and light mouthfeel with leather, acidic red fruit, some oak and medium tannins. Really accessible and nice. "
20227,3334018,"Quinta de Baixo was bought by Dirk Niepoort in 2012. He is the fifth generation of the Niepoort port house. 🍇 Braga from the Bairrada region. Aged 20 months in large oak barrels. Pale ruby colour. Aromas of oak, blackberries, cherries 🍒, chocolate, spices and violets. On the palate vanilla, oak, chocolate 🍫, blackberries, cherries, spices and licorice. A dry, fruity and somewhat spicy wine. A med body with med tannins. A med+ acidity and a med++ 🏁. Paired good with the spicy 🌶️ pasta 🍝. 👍 Yes, 3. 8✨."
20228,3334018,"The sixt wine from the Portuguese wine tasting. Easily the most discussed.  Light brick in color, quite transparent. Reminiscent of Nebbiolo, but less strong in taste. Watery was mentioned.  Strong scents of cow manure, stables. Earth, tobacco and red berries. Long, interesting taste with berries, chocolate, oak, pine. Some tannins."
20229,3334018,Light red colored is what you’ll see in the glas. The vine is a mix of kod and newer vine plants it has been on maturation 20 months before bottling unfiltered. Craneberry on the nose and a bit of sourness together with red cherries is what I felt together with a long after taste. It was ok to enjoy it by itself with some cashew nuts but more a meat vine although its softness. I could enjoy it this afternoon with tournedos of elk and gratin of root vegetables and potatoes.
20230,3334018,In the glass light red semi dense On the nose spicy black cherries thyme herbs Dark red berries On the nose well rounded fruity wonderful body Quality in a mouthful Black cherries cedar thyme spicy herbs balanced tannins and acidity  Absolutely marvelous!!!!  Portuguese character  Dont want the bottle to ever finish   
20231,3334018," Light, fresh and balanced Baga. Notes of red cherries, plum, Pomegranate, lingonberry, raspberry and a bit of cedar. Granit colour, high acidity, low tannin and light body.   Very nice wine to drink with a light lunch. "
20232,3334018,"Medium intensity ruby red in colour. On the nose - strawberry, raspberry, black cherry, blackberry, pepper, green herbs, violet, sweet smoke and earth. On the palate - medium(+) body, medium acidity and medium(+) tannins (very smooth and well integrated). Notes of blackberry, crushed pink pepper and macerated strawberry. Easy drinking, very refreshing. "
20233,3334018,"Absolutely essential this is given an hour to breath. A real sign as well that this could be something truly special if given a bit of time.   Nose is a little muted - but red fruit and spices coming through.   Body once it opens up is an absolute treat acidity is sharp but allows the wine to be defined, while the tannins are stronger than other Baga wines I’ve tried but asa a result they complement that Portuguese fruit beautifully.   89 pts  "
20234,3334018,"Light colored with significant, inviting and freash smell from mainly strawberries and some oak. Good balanced body and taste from red summerfruit. Mainly strawberries, raspberries and a hint of plums. Short ending but smooth tannins. Very nice overall! "
20235,3334018,"Elegant in clarity, colour and taste. A bit to much leather in the finish, but I guess this can be fixed by being patient..."
20236,3334018,"I am starting to repeat myself, sorry, but DO try this delicious Portuguese “ Beaujolais”: yummy and only 15€! Love it!"
20237,3334018,"A sophisticated and unique wine at a great price. Lavender and violet and a hint of vanilla on the nose; bourbon and cherry, but with a pleasant acidic brightness, cranberry at the end. Smooth and light bodied but not unsubstantial.  "

 Rushed Madeira tasting. Scant notes. Ratings for my own benefit & future reference"
20242,1319279,"4.5* Wonderful Frasqueira Boal. Pronounced intensity of caramel, honey, white raisins, figs, spice (cinnamon), cedar, dried apricot, and tobacco on the nose. It shows complexity with elegant character and depth. Bittersweet long finish. Delicate high acidity leading to freshness. Love this Madeira.(RS: 83g/L, TA:7.76)"
20243,1319279,"What a wonderful wine - I had it with a cheese plate but it would have been perfect on its on its also.   Caramel, honey, dried apricots, dates - all combined with a vivid acidity so the wine was nie fat at all. The sweetness just balanced it out.   The nose reminds me of an Amontillado but the Madeira brings slightly sweetness along with him. "
20244,1319279,"Found this at a Lisbon wine bar at 2 am at €20 per glass. Barbeito remains the best Madeira wine by such a long stretch! Big and open nose of orange peel, dried pineapple and mango, brown spices and ginger. Sweet and luscious palate of dried fruits, good freshness and length. This is incredibly deep and fine, totally uplifting and satisfying."
20245,1319279,"Fruity and romantic aroma, scents of raisins and dry fruits makes a perfect night cap! Especially outstanding when you have the last 10ml of this wonderful wine."
20246,1319279,"Excellent Madeira! Caramel and sour and sweet but subtle, age, refined. Nice light colour "
20247,1319279,"Acidjazz on speed, with sweetness"
20248,1319279,A beauty. Acid perfectly balanced with sweet all the way through
20249,1319279,Sweet but the high acidity just puts it in check. Great Madeira!
20250,1319279,fresh squeezed orange juice cigarette aroma chestnut smoke full body high acidity
20251,51734,"Given an hour decanted, this mellowed out to a smooth interesting , character wine.  Bold and dry, it complimented a chicken and chorizo arriabatta perfectly."
20252,51734,"Fantastic wine.  Dark purple in the glass which stains the edges pink.  Nose of tobacco, ripe blackberries, mint, cassis.  Full bodied and thick - it tastes like biting into a bunch of fresh ripe grapes.  Warm, leathery and tannic finish.   I would love to taste a better wine for £17."
20253,51734,"Deep purple. Medium(+) aromas of  green bell pepper, blackberry, black cherry, smoke, cedar, cloves. Youthful. The palate is dry, medium acidity, medium tannins, medium alcohol, medium body, medium(+) flavours of black fruit, herbaceous, oak influenced flavours. The finish is medium(+). This is a very good wine. Drink now. The first bottle we drank on its own, following a long week in the office."
20254,51734,"Very Enjoyable! Elegant yet possessing some punch!  Grape Varieties 🍇 50% Touriga Franca  30% Touriga National  20% Tinta Roriz A composition that worked perfectly!  Dark ruby hue, bouquet of ripe plum, black currant, mushy cherry, tobacco  cedar. In the mouth, structure is very fine, worked sublimely with Iberian pork!  Some spices emerged along for a round finish!  "
20255,51734,"A really good Portuguese Douro wine that oozes quality.  It will improve further still over the next few years too.   Full flavoured and deliciously moorish, not too tannic and ever so gentle.  More please.  🍷🍷🍷🍷"
20256,51734,"4,4⭐️ Amazing stuff ! Obrigado Portugal! "
20257,51734,Great wine. Smells of cherry. In the taste light  but with tannins.
20258,51734,"Excellent Duoro. Very perfumed, with strong smells of dark, summer fruits. Nicely balanced with a little acidity at the end. "
20259,51734,"Crowd pleasing Douro red. Very bold with deep, smoky aromas and gorgeously complex on the palate. Still young, but great already!"
20260,51734,"Deep ruby, pronounced nose. Blackberry, plum, black currant, red cherry, violet, prune, vanilla, tobacco, chocolate, cinnamon, earthy, leather, smoke, black pepper and hazelnut. Developing.  Dry, medium acids, medium (+) tannins, medium alcohol, medium (+) body, pronounced flavour intensity and medium (+) finish.  Enjoyable wine and as with a lot of Portuguese wines, you are getting great value for money. Powerful wine, tannins are smooth.  Cheers and happy Friday 🍷🍷"
20261,51734,"Solid winter red. At first (after less than 20' decanting) the nose was shy and dominated by the oak, the palate quite green (tomato leaf, eucalyptus). But after ~60' of decanting, it opened up to more fruity and complex aromas of mulberry, ripe plum, leather and cigar box. It also softened up to a very balanced palate and plush mouthfeel. "
20262,51734,"Dark cherry in colour. Really stood out colour wise. Smelt cherry, a little oak. Tasted cherry, mild tobacco, had a little spice on the aftertaste, tannins were good balanced by decanting and it was very good with beef brisket. Not normally a blend fan but this was enjoyable and reasonably priced."
20263,51734,"At first I wasn’t quite impressed, as her nose seems to be a bit too subtle. As time goes by, her initial vegetal nose of tomato turns into red fruit, and predominantly sweet spice, such as cinnamon. The hue is purplish, and it is evidently full-bodied. On the palate, she is thick,  velvety, with appropriate acidity that makes her round and a long finish. A fine wine though not my favourite of the night."
20264,51734,Dark color with a pleasant fruit taste. Bold in flavor that is pleasing…nice quality taste for price range. Saad recommended 
20265,51734,"Beautiful Douro from Casa Ferreirinha. Great blend of touriga Franca, touriga nacional and tinta Roriz. "
20266,1267265,"As we say in the fine wine tasting circuits, shit Pomfritte-  The 2012 surpasses the 2010 by far - indeed I am ridiculously in love with this vintage. Very seldom do you find this inpeccable virgin fruit balance, combined with just a right amount of integrated tannins landing in long aftertaste - simply & probably you will not find it in the store,  but if you do - buy it!     "
20267,1267265,"Great blend of Douro and Dao grape Classic , complex nose, more like Bordeaux  Bell pepper, dried red berries, briar, leather, tobacco , blood Elegant, dry and balanced palate with medium acidity and soft tannins"
20268,1267265,Drinking this overlooking Oporto.a lovely wine that is no longer produced
20269,1267265,"First Portuguese wine which tastes me a lot. Mix from Doura and Dao region. Elegant and fruity but not overweighted. Perfect for friends mtg with hard cheeses,"
20270,1267265,"Classy red with a intriguing body which is mildly bold. Complex, with a dry tannic finish - fruitiness interspersed with grassy herbaceous notes culminates in a delightful experience supported by an aromatic nose. "
20271,1267265,Very good Douro with a dark purple color in the aroma and taste dominated by dark fruits in the background red fruits notes of oak vanilla chocolate tobacco leather earthy smoke mushrooms cinnamon pepper well balanced medium acidity slightly irritable tannin good wine with ripening cheese.  🍇🍷👍🏻😃👌🏻
20272,1267265,Tasting at Quinta de Nápoles in Douro. This red is a collaborative project between Douro's Quinta de Nápoles and Dão's Quinta de Pellada. Combines the ripe structure from 130+yr vines of Douro (60%) with Dão's fresh elegance. Both were fermented in stone Lagares and aged 1.5+yrs in French oak.  Nose: fruit forward with inky heavy black plum dominating.  Palate: dried figs contrast with pomegranate acidity. Medium tannins. Stemmy greenness provides relief from the intensity. Nice acidity toward the end.
20273,1267265,Great wine. Very well balanced. Great smell. Its taste ends very suddenly.
20274,1267265,Touriga blend from Douro and Dao hence the name. Big smooth dry red 
20275,1267265,"Beautiful balance, black fruit and beautiful acidity."
20276,1267265,"Decent wine that I had at a random wine bar in lisbon. Fruity, decent and quaffable."
20277,1267265,"Fruity, elegante, with Porto notes. A senior wine with lovely stories to tell. "
20278,1267265,Unusual. Try it but only if you like unusual tastes
20279,1267265,"Not well known, but incredible full body Wine "
20280,1267265,"A successful blend made by Dirk Niepoort and Alvaro de Castro - combining freshness and elegance of Dao and character of Douro - encompasses the best of the two regions. This edition is the result of combining 60% of a blend of wine from the Douro, produced at Quinta de Nápoles from very old vines, one of which is over 120 years old, with 40% of a blend of Dão produced at Quinta da Pellada, from old vines, with the region's characteristic varieties: Tourigo, Jaen, Alfrocheiro and Tinta Roriz "
20281,1136728,Plum to the Nose Deep Dark inviting Red.  Oak Smoke  Bold 14% Medium Tannins Acidic Dry.  An excellent bold deep red complementing dinner. 
20282,1136728,Nice taste with  vanilla and light  cherry. Medium strong taste with  cherry oak blackberry on the tounge. Medium Long taste. 
20283,1136728,"Deep dark garnet colour. Dark fruit and black cherries, tabbaco and toasty notes. Full bodied, full mouth feel. One of my favourite organic red discoveries! "
20284,1136728,Medium bodied medium acid medium tannins. Red fruits like strawberry and red currant combined with purple fruits like plum and blackberry. Finish with (in my opinion) a bit too much oak and vanilla. 
20285,1136728,"Really nice wine from Portugal.  👃: Plum (+ something I couldn't figure out) 👅: Plum, cherry and very faint hints of green pepper. Medium acidity and medium tannins. Worked very nicely with pasta. Definitely, a wine I will have soon again. :)"
20286,1136728,"4.0 Very tasty full bodied red from Portugal’s Douro region. Pretty straight forward with lots of dark fruit on the palate. Blackberry, plum, some tobacco. A touch of vanilla. Lots of tannins, but well controlled. Long finish. Pretty heavy on the alcohol (14%) but still very enjoyable on its own. Postively surprised by this one. I am beginning to like my recent Portugese escapades!"
20287,1136728,"Full bodied and smokey, this one fills the mouth and leaves a taste of tobacco, vanilla, cassis and liquorice.   Pairs well with spicy food or pleasant on it's own. And at 8.79 from waitrose you cant go wrong."
20288,1136728,"Delightful blend with plum, dark cherry, blackberry, oak.  Bold, well rounded with longish and smooth aftertaste. "
20289,1136728,"Black dark fruit, black currant, Ribena on the nose. Bit earthy, notes of beetroot. Pepper tangy spice. 3.8 ⭐️ "
20290,1136728,"Cherry, plum and vanilla on the nose. Black Cherry, toasted oak, cinnamon and plum on the pallet. Tannins are a little high, acidity is medium plus, and medium plus body. 85/100"

20293,1136728,"Dark fruits, vanilla and very smooth."
20294,1136728,Wine at Betty and Stefs
20295,1136728,Slightly smokey nose with date and vanilla on the pallet and lovely rounded woody finish 
20296,1150822,"A powerful vintage Port. Black fruit on the nose, dried fruit, almonds and chocolate. Tobacco, coffee and leather on the palate, hints of cheese on the finish. Overall complex, lasting and enjoyable."
20297,1150822,"The Pocas comes out of the bottle almost black.   I’m not a Port expert by a long shot.  But, this was the last wine poured and was the best received wine of the evening.  And, the competition was pretty tough.   Lots of dark cherry fruit with a hint of leather on the finish.   It was a very smooth wine.  Given its relative youth I’m very curious about what leaving the rest of the bottles in the cellar for a few years will do to this wine. "
20298,1150822,Young and expressive.... Fruit forward and sweet... Tasted before tasting the 1992...  A few years of aging could be a Bomb ! 
20299,1150822,"This is just good, rich and fruity, cherry, plum and maple syrup.  Some may say I ruined a fine port, but i poured this with equal parts Stagg, Jr, one (real) Maraschino cherry, and it made one heck of fantastic drink....cheers!"
20300,1150822,"Dry, smooth, and delicious. Some fruit with tannins that push through. Great twany with dark rich color."
20301,1150822,Strong and elegante.. Dark fruit and chocolate
20302,1150822,"Young and expensive, like one of those escorts, special occasion only ;)"
20303,1150822,Alright. This was my first Ruby port and I think I was expecting something more tawny like. Doesn’t have that richness I wanted. For $60 it definitely isn’t blowing me away.
20304,1150822,"A young port, a bit on the dry side on the finish. "
20305,1150822,Can be used for many things also as stand alone. Safe choice
20306,1150822,"Tasty and developed Porto. A bit more acidity and it would be really great.  Smokey cherry nose with baking spices, some clove and nutmeg. Medium acidity, thick and creamy, medium sweet, jammy red fruit, cake, marzipan, roasted hazelnuts, mint chocolates, mild but drying tanines, some alcohol burn.   Fantastic with the classic pairing with blue and Limburger (Hèrve) cheese, grapes and almonds."
20307,1150822,"Elegant, black, intense, still young but a very approachable port wine ! And today it is #PortWineDay - so perfect day to enjoy good ports ! "
20308,1150822,"Very balanced and delicate. Showing well with medium plus structure, rich but not overwhelmingly fruity, with a lighter spicier and drier style than other 2013 VPs I've tasted. Approachable and will possibly be good for 15-20 years. More than that will be risky"
20309,1150822,"Nutty and really raisiny, but shows the very hot nature of the vintage. Full-bodied and very sweet, with loads of fruit and a long finish.  "
20310,1150822,"Drunk over 2 days from D+8. Young, vibrant, hot in the mouth and the nose, thickened up nicely at 24 hours, very long finish."
20311,75979,"Complex pine and mint aroma, freshness, chocolate, great living tannins, long finish and long life ahead ... Great wine of the world. "
20312,75979,"This one will give the best Bordeaux wines a good run for their money😉 More specific - stellar review to arrive as soon as I have picked myself up from the floor! ( 20 min later) Half standing, I believe dark fruit is too easy, of course dense and yes with fruit, but maybe a distinct herbaceous note from salvia and a hint of forest floor/mushrooms – showing some maturity. Everything including alcohol at 14.5 is superbly well integrated. Expensive – but very few Portuguese wines are🤩🤓 "
20313,75979,"Très bon Douro, signifié avec le raison pas assez bon pour être dans le Barca Vehla. Fruits noires, prune et mûres, assez boisé, chocolat et cuir. Belle acidité. Great Douro, grapes not used to create the Barca Vehla. Black fruits, prune and blackberry, woody, chocolate and leather. Pleasant acidity."
20314,75979,"This wine is a clear deep ruby.  The nose is clean with med + intensity. Aromas of blackcurrant, blackberry, vanilla, clove, leather, earthy, forest floor and black tea.  The palate is dry with med + acidity and high alcohol. It has med chalky tannins. The body is full and the finish is very long and smooth. The intensity is med + and follows from the nose.  Outstanding quality wine that was shared by a friend at a Portuguese wine night I was invited too. Lovely wine with life left in it."
20315,75979,"Wow, this wine definitely deserve to be put on the fine wine map. Second wine of Barca Velha, showing a beautiful balance, first opening on black fruit and finishing with leather and toast character, cedar wood and hint of vanilla. Highly recommend!"
20316,75979,"This wine arrives in a deep ruby red robe, with alluring fragrances of blackberry preserves, Moroccan leather, black plum, forest floor ,cedar, cigar box as well as floral hints, a touch of minerality, spicy tones of black pepper and ground clove. Explosive , rich and charismatic on the palate ,excellently structured with firm tannins of great quality, balanced by refreshing acidity. The great intensity and complexity of this stunning performance ends in a heavenly long lasting finale !!"
20317,75979,"There’s always something you can tell about this bottle, but you just prefer to keep it to your self… 😂 Selfish 🍷🍷"
20318,75979,Perfect wine. I should have kept a few more years but I was too anxious to try it. 
20319,75979,Great second wine from Barca Velha.
20320,75979,"Great year for Portuguese grapes. Quality Complex and consistent wine with great colour, a strong scent and a strong and eloquente taste"
20321,75979,Perfection in wine.
20322,75979,"Probably the best Portuguese wine. Fantastic, very subtle style with well integrated and smooth tannins. Highly complex aromas"
20323,75979,Amazing.  Its a very good wine.
20324,75979,Absolutely me me me !! Love Douro Love this I’m buying more !!!!
20325,75979,"Portuguese wine theme evening with a HUGE line up of 20+ bottles  Got to try only 14, without spitting a single drop... which meant a BIG hangover the second day 😂  So I am only rating them based on how much I liked each. No Notes   An eleven year young wine with a WOW factor 😍 5 ⭐️ in another 10 years  CHEERS 🍷"
20326,1563022,Pure wood. Some citrus. Light but not simple. Another good Portuguese experience to round off the trip. Tomorrow back home!
20327,1563022, red fruit earthy tobacco
20328,1563022,Cumin. Tobacco. Coffee. Gooseberry. Red fruits. Low on tannins. 
20329,1563022,So silky. Typical bairrada baga and a joy to drink with truffle pasta.
20330,1563022,"Good sparkling wine producer, launching this light and fresh Baga varietal. Liked the lighter body, dry wine. Bit too acidic for a red, but quite elegant on the palate."
20331,1563022,"Informal mixed bag red wine tasting, not enough time for detailed tasting notes.  A slightly better Baga. More structure, better acidity and more present tannins, albeit quite soft. More fruit concentration, bundels of dark fruit and hint of red fruit. Very decent, its s bit pricy snd not necceceary worth your penny."
20332,1563022,"Ruby red. Dark berries and spices in the nose. A very nice mouth of cherries and darker berries. Perfectly balanced. And with a silky tannic finish. Why bother with overpriced burgundy labels, when there are ample alternatives."
20333,1563022,"Cherry, red fruit, plum, dark fruit, eucalyptus, oak, licorice, dried fruit, leather."
20334,1563022,"Red fruit, cherry, dark fruit, plum, earthy & oak."

20336,1563022,"Cherry, blue cheese , mid tannins. Greeat!"
20337,1563022,This “Could have been” was corked.... 
20338,1563022,"Strong nose, light body, round with watery feeling in mouth but long finish. Different but nice! Red fruit flavors "
20339,1563022,"12,5% alcohol Baga. Light bodied red with lots of fruits and freshness. Juicy style with a nice mid palate and finish!  Great wine!"
20340,1563022,Not very flavorful. Extraordinarily light in color. Would not buy again.
20341,1216147,"Nice blend of Portugese grape varieties mixed with 5% viognier. Balanced wine, mouth-filling and subtile maturing on wood."
20342,1216147,Stone fruit fresh wine with vanilla and just a hint of oak. A complex wine that is fresh and very drinkable! 
20343,1216147,It is grand but pricey! Delicate with a bit of complexity. Tropical pineapple with a hint of oak. Alcohol does stick out a little. 
20344,1216147,"Peach, minerals and slightly oaky. Very well balanced "
20345,1216147,Peach and a little bit of oak with vanilla
20346,1216147,"Very good. Slight saltiness to it, but very smooth and quite a bit of  body. Dry finish. Went excellently with some salty ham and cheese."
20347,1216147,This wine is fruity with lemon and melon notes. It was aged in wood that has given a ripe lightly toasty character to the wine along with its cool crispness.
20348,1216147,"Price quality ratio is on point for this one.  👀 straw yellow colour 👃medium+ intense, peach, anise, hint of grapefruit and oak 👅 full and round. Butter, peach, melon.   Real nice"
20349,1216147,"Blend of Síria, Verdelho, Arinto and Viognier from Alentejano 🇵🇹.  Partially fermented and aged in barrique.   Ripe peach and nice notes of tropical fruits.  Med bodied. Oaky and Creamy."
20350,1216147,Tangy and tannic.  Very nice and eminently drinkable when paired with acidic food. 
20351,1216147,"Fruity, but more importantly it has some mineral taste. Strong body and medium aftertaste. Yellow colour."
20352,1216147,Very nice white wine
20353,1216147,"A southern Portugal white. Herbaceous nose with grass, hay and anise. Med acidity, herby flavors, subtle spices, med+ finish. Well made balanced wine. 14 pts @ Wakende Haan Abcoude."
20354,1216147,"Lovely stone fruit and blood orange notes, long finish with hints of peach..."
20355,1216147,"Red fruits, violets. Good acidity"
20356,1216909,One of my favorite Douro wine 🍷 that truly gets and provide one of the finest and most elegant red out there in this region 😋 a young but already very classy wine 👍 and a long way to age and provide even more pleasure 
20357,1216909,Cherry and raspberry on the nose against a backdrop of leather and mushroom.  Beautiful earthy flavours here.  An absolutely stunning wine.
20358,1216909,What a wine! Similar in style to the best red Burgundy wines. Especially the bouquet is magnificent with notes of red flowers and classy perfume. A mediumbodied feminine style and long persistent aftertaste.
20359,1216909,Very pleasant. Cherries and leather on the nose with hints of mushroom and raspberry on the finish. Light and pleasant but with a nice lingering finish. 
20360,1216909,"Chosen for us by the Sommelier at 28-50's Mayfair branch, this was enjoyable, though not as great as he'd intimated it would be! 😉.  The average vine age is 70, though some are over 100 years. The hand-picked grapes are fermented in granite lagares & barrels & it's aged in French oak for 26 months before 9,500 bottles were made.  It's 13.9% ABV but tastes lighter with some light cherry & cranberry flavours amongst the earthiness & minerality. Silky smooth with med acidity & fine tannins. Good long finish."
20361,1216909,"Blend of Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and other varieties. Elegant and complex Burgundy style from Douro. Delicate pale cherry colour, red fruit on the palate.soft integrated tannins. Could be a Pinot Noir.  Intriguing wine from a reliable producer."
20362,1216909,So I went to the Spanish grocery...  Portugués wine haul coming soon.
20363,1216909,"Superb red. One of the finest I have ever found. Great nose, smooth, long finish."
20364,1216909,"This wine is delicate, complex, spiced….. on the softer side…. Would say it is good after 45 minutes decanted…. Needs some time… cheers"
20365,1216909,"Very well balanced, mix of red and black berries Douro blend, with medium tannins, acidity and body, and a very lingering finish. A classic Bordeaux rive gauche imitator"
20366,1216909,"Very fruity, balanced, but zero complexity, all the notes are very simple and short on the mouth"
20367,1216909,"88/100  Foot pressed and macerated in lagares for 3 days, fermentation finish in barrels and age for 15m  Pale ruby  Smoked ripe raspberry cinnamon sweet cassia bark ripe red currant fresh strawberry vanilla and butter cream  M body High acidity M soft tannins M alcohol Pronounced intensity Long finish  This grape varieties made in this style shows the high skilled viticulturalist and winemaker. Great elegance along concentration, length and potential of ageing. Therefore complexity is not at the highest "
20368,1216909,Closed and not spectacular at first. I let it rest for a day and now it's an explosion. Smooth as a grand Burgundy so right down my alley 
20369,1216909,"Notes from a Portuguese tasting a while back: another blockbuster from the great Niepoort. A very interesting contrast to the Batuta, both in colour and taste. Elegant floral, herbal and caramel nose. On the palate oh so really smooth and sexy in texture. Very ""Burgundian"", perhaps ""Chambollian"". Lovely creamy fresh red berries, herbal, very seductive and I love it! A really great wine."
20370,1216909,"Just lovely! Ruby red color. Soft and smooth tannins. Well-balanced and complex wine with a high acidity. Autum forest with earthy notes, mushroom and oak flavour with ripe strawberry, cherry and blueberry. Long and mild aftertaste."
20371,1872419,"This wax-sealed stunner from Graham’s has a single Vineyard source. Stone Terraces is dark purple & Inda-ink hued, with blackberry liqueur & inky scents showing on the nose. The palate’s sweeter-side has a contrasting tone that’s dark & brooding, & with generous concentration. Blackberry, currant, & boysenberry flavors show, along with other central flavor notes of black licorice, eucalyptus, tar, cedar, & violet. Long enjoyable finish. RS around 6.4% (6.4 Baumé). $200. me97, ws96, d98, we95. "
20372,1872419,"This is a very special bottle, there are only produced about 250 bottles of this wonderful products. I think there is lots of dried fruits like figs, prunes, black currant, and a long strong after taste. It is a really treat and I feel very lucky about tasting this wonderful port wine."
20373,1872419,"Trying this over a period of 48 hrs. Started out as extreme fruit but not a lot of power but without no real tannins and acid, after 5 hrs the tannins started showing and a intense taste of black currant, Vanilla, black pepper and leather. After spending the night at 15c in my wine fridge it opened up some more showing even more acid and tannins and a lot of power in both the nose and in the mouth. Now 26 hrs after opening blackberries are added to the taste and it’s still opening up. Huge potential"
20374,1872419,Amazingly aromatic with a wonderful balance of not being overly viscous or lean bodied. The quality is outstanding 
20375,1872419,"Sublime. Quinta dos Malvedos. Clear, deep purple. Clean, pronounced intensity aroma of blackberry, raspberry jam, violet, rose petal, chocolate, menthol. Very young but completely approachable. Sweet, high acidity, high tannins, full body and long finish. Palate is velvety. Insane. Complex, well balanced, outstanding quality. Boardroom experience. "
20376,1872419,"(4,8) Absolutely faultless. Simultaneously elegant, silky, powerful, complex, rich. Absolute balance here. Plums, blackcurrant, black cherries, mint, herbs. Mineral structure here even. Medicinal notes. Structured and silky."
20377,1872419,"Orange scented with a velvet body. In the glass, strawberry pushes out the orange glaze and bites into clove and its own leaves. A woodsy backbone impresses. This has great potential."
20378,1872419,"Amazing wine, perfection"
20379,1872419,"The aromas here are amazing: crushed blueberries and raspberries with wet earth and dried flower. Orange blossom. Tar and stone. Full body, very sweet but the powerful and fine-grained tannins balance the wine out. Tannins and fruit envelop your mouth with each sip. "
20380,1872419,"As for a young vintage however excellent wine could still be a lot of wait, prevailing in it notes of fruits fig raisin prune plum black cherry and red fruits cherry strawberry of course there is everything you need for this type of wine vanilla chocolate toffee caramel hazelnut walnut almond . Well balanced medium acidity in taste besides pleasant sweetness, mainly dark and red fruits. For me , outstanding Porto . 🍇🍷👍🏻😃👏🏻⭐️"
20381,1872419,"The wine has so much fruit and intensity, the fruit is wonderfully integrated even at this young age. The tannins coat your mouth in a sumptuous fashion. If this is consumed before 2066 it will be a real shame. "
20382,1872419,Best Port this year
20383,1872419,"Wow.  Don’t think that infanticide has ever been this much fun!  This is supremely elegant already.  None of the heat and overwhelming spice you normally get with young Port.  Rich fruit, orange zest, herbs and medicinal notes.  A wine I want to bathe in!  One of the best wines of a spectacular tasting tonight at Hedonism.  Whose enomatic I love!"
20384,1872419,Quite good quality for a 1977 port that was bottled on 1979. 41 years of embalmment in a bottle reflect the level of oxidation. 
20385,1872419,Great port with charcuteries cheese or choclate
20386,83737,Why don’t we drink port any longer! Delicious and perfect with a blue cheese. A bit of tannins balance the sweetness and a great body!
20387,83737,"Dark fruit and floral notes on the nose. On the mouth tastes of cherry, raisins and chocolate. Pleasantly sweet, very smooth with a medium body. "
20388,83737,Really enjoyed this. Beautiful bouquet of ripe and dried dark fruit. Smooth and rich with toasted sugar. Alcohol did not dominate like it often can.

20400,83737,Complex and chocolatey
20401,1308697,"Cherry, plum, oak, earthy. Delicious, to ask for more. On the palate, fills one’s mouth and activate all senses.  Aging will do wonder, it’s outstanding now, will get top in a few years."
20402,1308697,"Everything you want from a Douro red. Youngish but already packs a punch. Very fragrant nose with violet. It has delicious notes of red berries, vanilla and chocolate.

Very nice perfumed floral, herbal, tobacco nose. On the palate just very well-balanced between juicy fresh dark fruit, spicy sweet tobacco, leather, earthy, very smooth texture and round tannins. You forget that it is 14,5%, this is pretty smooth. And it went very well with beer-braised lamb shanks! "

20449,1702386,"A little bit too oaky, maybe needs some more time in bottle. 8,8 PM"
20450,1702386,"Nice nice one, pure and modern"
20451,1702386,"Fantastic, tasty, soul... A wine with soul, history"
20452,1702386,Good for meat.
20453,1702386,"Lots of vanilla going on from the oak. Minor aromatic tones of orange leaf, lemon."
20454,1702386,Another great Saturday afternoon... Cem Reis-White  Hope everyone is well. Wish you all a nice weekend.
20455,1702386,perfect spark of oak.
20456,1702386,For hot weathers and special companies there’s nothing better to drink 
20457,1702386,"One of the best this year. Not an easy white, distinc flavor of dry fruits and needs some oxigen before being at point. Complex with wood well aged. Its even a good wine to save a couple of years. Had it with fish and sea good. Oisters are a charm with this one. "
20458,1702386,WoW!!! Excellent Viognier from one of the best Winery in Alentejo very famous for their red wines. Vibrant acidity and freshness 
20459,1702386,"Interesting Portugal white made from viogner, coming from Alentejo region... Easy going one, not too much complex, highly enjoyable."
20460,1702386,"A great Viognier, aromatic, fruity, nice texture in the mouth with a long finish "
20461,1105366,Blackberries and strawberries on the nose. Medium to high grippy tannins. Nice berry flavours. Long finish. Expensive but just about worth 23 euro ...
20462,1105366,"Um grande vinho portugues, from the Alentejo region! I was quite impressed  by its slow-motion opening up. It is dense, opaque and runs the risk of not being polished if does not rest long enough in bottle. A wine for Autumn.  Aromas of very ripe black forest fruits, violettes. A subtle note of vanilla and heavy on oak-like tertiary notes, including smoke. In mouth, part of this intense 'crianza' is passed and pending to be polished. Bur all in all, this 2010 presents good refinement. Interesting. Elegant."
20463,1105366,"dark wine. complex nose of ripe fruit and spice. The palate is an impact of ripe flavours. fruit tannins ,ripe red and black fruit ,cigar box . well integrated oak and tannins. rich and developing on the palate. lovely fresh acidity adds to the smooth and fragrant finish."
20464,1105366,"Very tight body, a lot of everything. Blackcurrant, spices, coffee, chocolate,stylish, modern, good accidity. Value for the money."
20465,1105366,Enjoyed it a lot! Lots of character from this Portuguese. Had pleasant tannin with hints of vanilla. Lots of dark berries but not overwhelming. 
20466,1105366,"Deep red color, with hints that combines some florals and cinnamon. Clear red berry and plum notes, complex l structured wine."
20467,1105366,"91/100. Outstanding nose, deep red fruit, great maturity.   Palate delivers at almost the same level. A fine wine from start to finish."
20468,1105366,"Magnum, complex like sunny blueberries with  some special woody flavored red fruits, nice in the nose keeps complex at the mouth and stay endlessly!! ""Just try it"""
20469,1105366,"A good vintage for Esporao reserva, softer tanins than the 2009, fruit more present and a bit more American oak. New world style, pleasent and easy to drink. 16/20"
20470,1105366,"Ripe black cherry, raspberry bush and soft notes of underwood and oak. Hints of tonka bean. Chewy and broad with round tannins which linger in the mouth. Perfect with Portuguese suckling pig."
20471,1105366,"A rich, dry red with great depth that dances on the tongue. Peppery on the nose and subtle aniseed on the finish. An enjoyable wine. Unanimous decision to drink again...."
20472,1105366,"Bold wine with nice tannins well balanced with the alcohol. Some berries appearing, but not too complex. A lot of sediment due to the age. Went well with ribs and sausage stew"
20473,1105366,"Lovely. Nice aroma of ripe black  forest berries, underwood, wet leaves and stones, leather in the background. Palate intensive, thick but mild and smooth. Silky tannins, elusive acidity. Nice finish. I'm impressed by this Portuguese wine. 4,1/5"
20474,1105366,"Deep dark ruby with a violet tinge this blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira, Alicante Bouchet and CS first spreads aromas of sage, rosemary immediately followed by bouquet of dark flowers (violet, rose, lily) to finish with dried porcini mushroom and a slight woody accent. At palate it shows high tannin, bone-dry, mouthwatering with jam and dark fruit flavors of black cherry, blackberry, black currant. Medium acidity for long cellaring"
20475,1105366,"Deep purple red color and a lot of glycerine. In the nose woody, ripe blackberry fruits and nice spicy nuances. On the palette good structured tannins and full jammy fruit. Long finish. A wine to enjoy with some steak or just like that. Keeps easily 10y "
20476,1924186,What a wonder and a chance to explore some new grape varieties. Have you put Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional on your list? The fun in this region is the small capacity of individual vineyards and the local co-operativa that produce and market a range of wines based on what’s available. It’s highly experimental and characterful wine making. Naturally the majority is consumed locally but the atmosphere is highly collaborative - they share secrets. This is the family’s ‘Big’ wine. Thank you for sharing!
20477,1924186,"I think this is an intriguing wine. It’s main grapes are Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. But blended with Portuguese varieties so it still has that Alentejo terroir. It’s very good and the producer is a very good one that makes a lot of different wines. If you go to Evora, pay them a visit, it was the best wine tour I’ve ever had"
20478,1924186,"Elegant wine!   Taste of black currant and dark fruit   black fruit black cherry blackberry plum oak leather tobacco blueberry blackcurrant prune dark chocolate black olive pipe tobacco black plum  Enjoy, guys! Goooood wine 👌🏾"
20479,1924186,"Very dark red blue color. Dark fruit, oak, vanilla, cedar. Medium to full body, Sour cherry, good chewy tannins, medium+ acidity. Pretty good! Great with steak. A strong 4. Will likely get even better with 5+ years in the cellar."
20480,1924186,Good wine! Perhaps not so easy to find outside Portugal. Nevertheless if you come across this one try it. Worthy! 🍷❤️ 🇵🇹 
20481,1924186,Wow! A great refined and balanced red wine. All in finesse and contained intensity. I love it!!!
20482,1924186,"Dried fig came up straight away, then some cherry and oak, it’s a Portuguese wine, oak is extremely important when developing wine. Vanilla, leather and even some pepper are noticeable. Good blende from traditional grapes like the Syrah and the Portuguese Touriga Nacional. "
20483,1924186,"Balance is its middle name-blend of ‘international’ and local grapes, high alcohol so a lot of sun inside it-a wide range of flavours from primary to tertiary: plum, cloves, leather-all in a velvety and smooth mix-well done to the enologists for their choice "
20484,1924186,Fruity and well balanced. Great with cheese!
20485,1924186,"A bit disappointing. Strong peppery note, but bitterness not well balanced."
20486,1924186,Too biter. Very nice smell to red fruits though 👏. The current herdade de São Miguel is better and cheaper.
20487,1924186,Good price to quality ratio
20488,1924186,"Plum is overpowering, then accompanied with waves of fruitiness and that's just the bouquet. Benchmark material for Portuguese wines. Wonderfully fruity and very much its own identity. "
20489,1924186,"This young wine has a lovely bright ruby colour with a jammy strawberry nose. The palate is lively and juicy with fresh raspberry and red berry flavours, firm and grippy tannins to match and good length of flavour. Very drinkable."
20490,1924186,Amazing amazing wine. I can’t stop drinking
20491,1105366,"Oldie but goldie, ideal for a goodbye dinner. Really bright intense colour and not too heavy, made up of Trincadeira, Aragonez and Cabernet - it softly hints the pallat with notes of vanilla and chocolate and heavy on red fruits' sharpness."
20492,1105366,"Nose: tobacco, maybe some black currant, but subtle. Taste: black fruit, full bodied, thick and smooth, good balance. Pleasant, but maybe not great QPR. 3.9. In my opinion the Monte Velho is significantly better for half the price."
20493,1105366,"Revisited  Another very good Alentejo red! Powerful, bold and complex red, with a robust tannic structure, great fruit concentration and length. Ruby color, slightly floral, ripe red fruits, notes of spices and oak toast. Full body, polished tannins and a long finish. A very reliable red, showing great evolution! "
20494,1105366,"bright mixed berry fruit, well integrated oak adding layers of spice, creamy vanilla and milk chocolate... ;-)"
20495,1105366,"Esporao, Esporao close to the best i liked."

20507,1105366,Big berries. Big flavours. Big wine
20508,1105366,"Beautiful Portuguese blend, native varietals with the omnipresent CS in the mix.  This one has aged very gracefully.  Red and black fruit compotes, delicate spices, vanilla, cocoa beans, licorice. Well integrated, elegant, smooth silky tannins, complex. Good finish.  Bravo Portugal."
20509,1105366,"This wine has been gracefully aged. Nice spiced blackberry and cassis fruit with subtle oak complexity and touches of toffee and vanilla bean. Full - bodied,well- textured palate with smooth and refined tannins. Solid and dense with great aging potential!! "

20521,1361814,"88 Aroma had cocoa, raisins, dark chocolate, vanilla and dates. Over the palate came raisins, dark chocolate, prunes, dates, cocoa and vanilla. Medium acidity, medium tannins and dry."
20522,1361814,Port wine Christmas calendar 2020. 13 December.  Ruby style port from a single year but bottled later as the name indicates. Stored on large oak casks and bottled in 2020. 20% alcohol.   Deep dark opaque ​​red color. Nose and palate shows chocolate cherry ripe fruit plum fig vanilla honey raisin caramel. The taste is rich bold powerful but also extremely elegant with lots of balanced sweetness and a light tannic and acidity bite in the aftertaste. Heavy curtains.
20523,1361814,"Dark ruby colour. Prunes, dark cherry, licorice, and allspice aromas. Mild sweetness and long taste. Good intensity and length. "
20524,1361814,"Incredible smooth, deep plum and blackberry, concentrated flavor, good maturity, some pleasing residual sugar and alcohol warmth, a lovely sipper."

20528,1361814,We had this and a Dow's 20 year Porto (no photo) on the final ride home on the limo bus at my birthday party 🥳🚐 All I can say is that they were thoroughly enjoy by all. It was quite an evening.
20529,1361814,"Don’t drink a lot of port, so rating a bit from the hip. I liked this one. Powerful and not too sweet. Nice with fruity dessert. Dark cherries and also some chocolate. Nice stuff 🇵🇹 🍷👌"
20530,1361814,"Port Wine Christmas Calendar 13/12/2020. Another LBV, this time from Dow’s. Aged for 5 years in large oak barrels and bottled unfiltered in 2020 for this calendar.

Can drink now, suitable for further aging. "
20533,1361814,"I found ports to be a lot more unpredictable than wine. Even from the same producer, different ports can be all over the place. This one was a pleasant surprise. Not a great port but very good for the price. Everything you want in a nice bottle of port. Fruit, chocolate. And just the right but not overbearing sweetness to be willing to have a second glass. "
20534,1361814,"Dow’s Late Bottle Vintage Port 2015 is an inexpensive and worth a purchase fortified wine that has balance and complexity. A gentle sniff gets you blackberry, prune, raisin, dark chocolate, coffee, and walnut, which your palate will confirm. It pairs well with nutty bread pudding, as sweetness will match the dessert. Delectable!"
20535,1361814,"Medium ruby color.  Medium intensity nose with blackberry, cedar, dusty dirt floor, and black cherry.  Medium sweetness.  Medium acidity.  Medium (+) tannins.  Medium (+) body.

20536,1149926,"Dark red color.  Very elegant black ripe fruit aroma, with floral and spiced notes well integrated  with the toast barrels. In the mouth maintains the complexity, with very rounded tannins. It is embodied and very tasty. Medium and pleasant aftertaste. Great wine."
20537,1149926,"Big bold dry black cherry, pomegranate lively tannins and spice; nose has blueberry lavender and straw/grass.  Delicious on first strike but fairly low persistence that gets very juicy with hint of strawberry at mid-rear of tongue.  medium acidity makes this a luscious wine with fine distinct flavors that salt brought out with well paired food."

In the mouth: black cherries, blackberries, plum, dried herbs, smoked pepper, spices, old leather and a lot of minerals and earthy notes. Well structured and balanced wine, with well balanced tannins and mature fruity juicy acidity. Finish long and elegant."
20546,1149926,"A nice looong nose, I was sniffing there like pig in forest looking for truffles. Many different and nice notes, going from fruity dark berries to leather and tobacco. At the end, I pinched a scent of anis. Very pleasant sniffing. However a bit harsh in mouth, I was expecting softness in mouth like in nose but not. Strong enough to go with our Polish goulash."
20547,1149926,"Wow !  Dark red in the glass, nearly black in the decanter. Ripe red fruit. Medium bodied, velvet texture. Balanced and rich of influences.  Decanting highly recommended.  Medium finish but one that demands for more Aneto😀"

20549,1149926,"Coming back four years later on-site to the same producer, now it’s 2015 instead of 2003 vintage - the price has doubled to €10 and the wine is much more elegant and maybe a more main-stream offering. Nevertheless a couple of classic Douro offerings / eucalyptus  dark cherry but also an interesting clean saddle leather on the nose. Well integrated alcohol maybe slightly on the thin side with medium long finish."

Fresh fruit med acidity very tasty! what is so special about this wine is a lot of minerals, salt, smoke, herbs. more dominant than the fruits on the palate. this is a special wine, a very rewarding wine, which has a great aging potential "
20589,9001,"3.9 Another fantastic white from Niepoort. After trying the Reserva, I needed to drink the little brother. Field blend of Rabigato, Códega, Viosinho Gouveio and others. It has a really sharp backbone marked by gunpowder aromas, fennel, lime, stone fruit and a saline touch.  Refreshing, lean and light with great intensity in the mouth. Really fantastic option!"
20590,9001,"Grapes: Douro Branco 100% Redoma Branco is an intense, textured and luminous cuvée that reveals a beautiful power that is nourished over the length. A wine to cellar to fully savor its potential! Perfect, beautiful brilliant color, minerality and above all freshness. Suitable for all noble fish. To remember, Niepoort is definitely an excellent winemaker. Final score 4.0⭐ vintage 2019, pairing with a seabas fish 👌🥂"
20591,9001,"Another great wine from Portugal. This one has an intense minerality as well as some apple and orange notes to the nose. Fresh, salty, mineral, medium bodied and with crispy acidity in the mouth. Smooth and elegant till the end. A 4.1."
20592,9001,This is a lovely wine. Oaked just enough to take the sharp edges off of the acidity. This has a coppery hue to it's appearance.  Minerality in the nose. Some hints of a slightly unripe honey melon combined with flint in the mouth. Easy drinking. Should be good on a terrace in the summer sun.
20593,9001,"Paired it with cheese and vegetables, for light and fun dinner. Deep fruity taste. Great wine!!"
20594,9001,I know I drank it young but wow!!!!! A fantastic wine from an impressive winemaker. 
20595,9001,Complex structured fresh apricot. To repeat to remember!
20596,4443335,I love this wine! 
20597,4443335,Christmas Lunch perfect pairing
20598,4443335,"A single vineyard wine, coming from a plot,facing northwards and higher in altitude was served by the vintner after we tasted the Oratorio that came from a warm, oriented southward plot. Why?Phenolic ripeness is the keyword. Lots of intensity, melted aromas but razor sharp aligned: cranberry, raspberry, gentle wood tones,... Amazing wine which proves the Douro is a top region!"
20599,4443335,"[Boavista 3/3] This was an absolute gem demonstrating how higher altitude plots not facing Southwards in wine area’s like the Douro can offer an extra dimension. Fantastic nose with red apple, balsamic, kirsch, raspberry, rosebud, cranberry and a very fresh demeanor. The acidity in the palate is more pronounced but in a welcoming way thanks to masterfully integrated tannines, velvety power, red fruit, black currant, rosebud tea and a fantastic finish! 4.7"
20600,4443335,"Outstanding Douro red! This classic gem is a rich field blend from a single vineyard with +80y old vines and +25 varieties, fermented in new 500L French oak barrels and aged 18m in smaller size barrels (also French oak). Bold, deep and complex, with juicy acidity and terrific length. Deep purple color, floral, ripe dark fruits aromas/flavors, with notes of cassis, spices, mint, mocha and well integrated oak. Full body, with firm yet velvety tannins and a long tasty finish. Delicious treat, still growing!"
20601,4443335,Nice made wine but not much going on
20602,4443335,"Amazing, very smooth "
20603,5530762,"An organic blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca & others, aged 10m in French oak. Great value.  Deep ruby. Youthful w. blackberry, damson, black cherry, cassis & purity of plump ripe fruit. A floral violet note & an attractive touch of summer day asphalt.  Dry. Med bodied w. med rounded tannins, m+ alc, m+ acid & m+ flavour intensity. Ripe blackberry,  silky black cherry, damson, wild strawberry & a lightly earthy spice of tar & liquorice. Violet & dried dark flowers w. a well balanced m+ finish."
20604,5530762,"Loveeed it! Full body, red & dark fruit flavours. Leaves cinnamon, ginger tones on back of my palette which give pleasant aftertaste"
20605,5530762,"Truly delicious - dark fruit and berry on the palate, full-bodied, ripe and highly drinkable. Notes of Port in the nose - proper Douro experience. Great value too, a 4.25-"
20606,5530762,"Notes of cherry, black currant and slightly nutty in this smooth Douro. Really enjoyed this fuller bodied wine which had a lingering finish too. Excellent & would recommend. "
20607,5530762,"Quite basic but well balanced wine from a large producer. Organic blend of 5T from a good vintage. Decant properly!  L: garnet, violet rims, tiny legs at abv.13,5%. Med.intense, focused N: expressed violets, dark fruits and a back wall of tar. Reviving hints of mint, sage. P: full bodied, fruity, dry&bold. Dense but polished tannins, intense acidity-convincing backbone. Chalky, chocolaty notes makes it pleasant at finale. Warming, med.long aftertaste. Well priced evening star to support a beef shin. 3,7-3,8"
20608,5530762,"Dark prune color with purple edges.   Aroma of cigar, plum, fall leaves, blackberry, and mint. Juicy and dry taste with a long, dry finish. Best with food: Red meat, cured meat, aged cheese.   Good now, but can live for up to 10 years in the cellar.   88pt"
20609,5530762,"Big fan of Douro reds and this is a nice example. Deep ruby with good intensity of rich black fruit on the nose (blackberry, black cherry), vanilla and a bit of pungent spice coming through too.   Fair grip on the tannins and nice length of finish. "
20610,5530762,"The grapes for Quinta do Ataide Tinto are a typical Douro field blend of Tourigo Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Barroca, Tinta Roriz and Tinto Cao. Displaying on both the nose and the palate a beautiful bouquet of blackberry preserves, red plum fruit, spice box scents and hints of vanillin, dark chocolate and some toasted bread sensations. Excellent balance between the fruit - sugars and acids, with ripe tannins and a medium lasting finale."
20611,5530762,2016 vintage. A blend of mostly touriga nacional and touriga franca along with a host of other indigenous grape varieties. Popped and poured which was a mistake as the wine was tannic and tight. I saved some for day 2 and by then it had mellowed out with juicy red fruit underpinning a long finish. 3.75 ⭐
20612,5530762,"What can the Symington family do wrong? Fresh black fruit, m+ tannin and a lengthy finish rounds of this refined and low sediment organic wine. Powerful expression of the traditional Portuguese grapes, definitely one to add to your list if you haven't tried. Amazing with red meat "
20613,5530762,Fantastic bottle. Fruity and easy to drink but with enough depth to keep it interesting. I’d buy this again defo. 
20614,5530762,"Leather and oak initially with a good punch of dark fruit, some sage and pepper. Lovely and smooth "
20615,5530762,"It's a good red, nothing wrong with it. And it's good enough to vouch the 4"
20616,5530762,So Nice to match for steak lunch ! 
20617,5530762,"Forest fruits, vanilla. Fruity and smooth. Delicious!"
20618,6075656,"Beautiful vintage port, velvety smooth and full bodied. "
20619,6075656,And the desert recommendation 
20620,6075656,Really very good. Heaps of concentration but it also keeps its freshness. 
20621,6075656,Best wine ever
20622,33324,Disappointed in this initially. Not much better than a LBV. But a week later it was deep and plummy. Caramel came through. Almost as good as a true vintage year port
20623,33324,"Wines from Portugal, June 7 - wine fair - only rating. The last Porto of the night.  Rate 3.9"
20624,33324,"Expensive but nice.....full of forest fruit, liqourice and vennel seeds notes. Alcohol is a bit too much for me."
20625,33324,Still tight. As to age 
20626,33324,Yum.  Caramel and nuttiness that just grabs your attention and captivates you through the long finish.  Great after a long day of travel.  Woof!
20627,33324,"Excellent vintage based on three quintas - smoky earl grey like tannins, black forrest fruits - can easily age for another 20 years. Jancis gave this 18 points, I agree."
20628,33324,"What a find! Instant hit to the nose: Caramel, dried apricots, white chocolate.... An exquisite oiliness with sublime, persistent length"
20629,33324,"World peace. An end to poverty. Eradication of infectious disease. Vintage port by the glass. I decided to tackle the last of these great 21st Century problems first, taking my Coravin to this Fonseca. Initial results were poor, with sediment passing through the vintage needle. Pouring, letting it settle and then redecanting works, but at too high a cost in wine and time. A horizontal bottle on top of a wine rack, with the Coravin applied and wine poured with just a slight tilt, worked best. Disease next 👍"
20630,33324,"Good price, good value, getting better with years passing, a very pleasing port with spicy character but good get more depth "
20631,33324,"A real stunner - black fruit, caramel and dried fruit - absolutely perfect with cheese. Would definitely turn this non port wine lover into a true believer - one to seek out and savour - especially over the festive season! "
20632,33324,"Saturday older wines day!  Top Port. Good vintage, only best quinta’s used. And it is a Wow kind of wine. Subtle and fully integrated nuances of raisins, nuts, clay and spices.   Med+ acidity and spicy. Delicate yet firm flavors of earl grey tea, brambles, alcohol. Oily textured, med+ finish. Med sweet. Too young; serious potential! 17 pts @ Ton Overmars tasting."
20633,33324,"Absolutely delicious, unique and memorable. Notes of strawberry jam and maple syrup  Edit: and fig"
20634,33324,"The best Port I ever tried. Smoth, very strong and lingers in the mouth. Incredible."
20635,33324,"It's beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! Dried fruit on the palate, Christmas pudding, walnuts. It's very long and pleasant. Almost as old as me!:-)"
20636,33324,"Silky and refined.  Needs decanting to let the alcohol blast pass by like a summer thunderstorm. Then deep, rich but refreshing licorice,blueberry compote and a touch of pebbles in a stream.  Big, but not heavy; the acidity and high alcohol retention makes it perfect for roast duck dishes or even winged game done up in red wine sauce.  Decant and drink over 2/3 days.  Definitely want go find more and revisit in like 5 years.  A real beauty.  95/96 points"
20637,1751269,"92/100 Made from old vines. Distinctive on the nose with mountain berry fruit, meat, rosemary, and a touch of violets. For a full bodied red, the wine has really high acidity. It’s juicy with a tangerine peel finish. Small tannins are wiped away clean by the acidity. Unique, well-made, and screaming Portugal."
20638,1751269,Decanter London Spanish and Portuguese Wine tasting event 2020.  This wine is very rich very tasty and very moorish.  More please 😃 🍷🍷🍷🍷
20639,1751269,"Medium purple color, black currant, blueberry, long aftertaste with smoke, tobacco, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak and spice with silky tannins. Very nice. 4.3."

20641,1751269,"My favourite of the Crasto wines I tasted. 100% Touriga Nacional Only made in exceptional years with the best fruit 18 months in French oak Deep purple colour Beautiful nose with violet, fresh black fruits, earthy, tobacco leaf, warm spices, leather  Full bodied, but with wonderful freshness Grippy tannins  Blackberry, mulberry, blueberry, dried raspberries  Dark chocolate & dusty cocoa powder Dried Mediterranean herbs Long spicy finish with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and just a touch of saline minerality "
20642,1751269,"Medium to deep purple in color. Baking spices, cherry, black cherry, blueberry on the nose. The palate follows the nose and includes notes of vanilla. It has a subtle amount of tannins, which gives it a well-balanced and full taste. This is a really great wine!"
20643,1751269,"Touriga Nacional at its finest, produced only in the best years. Deep purple color. Intense aromas of violets, vanilla. In the mouth it has silky texture, so comforting. Combined with the plummy flavors, berries, and again vanilla, it’s just yummy. Well integrated tannins, overall impeccable balance of all elements. (Quinta do Crasto Tasting 6/6)"
20644,1751269,"Third wine I try from Crasto and quality is outstanding. Baked black plums, dark berries, blackberry compote, smoke, dark chocolate, allspice, cinnamon, pepper, well balanced oak. Bold, complex, but so surprisingly fresh and juicy at the same time. Young, but very well integrated tannins. Subjective, but that's the expression of TN that I really like. Opened this vintage definitely way too early, should be much better in 3-5 years. 4.3, rating is given a bit in advance with an aging perspective."
20645,1751269, blackberry blueberry black fruit oak
20646,1751269,Extremely rich. Curious to see how it matches a Maria Teresa I just got as a present 
20647,1751269,At the Wines of Portugal annual tasting with @[1|4684559|Janne W.]
20648,1751269,"This was possibly the Portuguese wine of the day for me. Powerful yet elegant, complex and grippy: this is now on the list! 4.25-4.5 ⭐️ "
20649,1751269,"Generous bouquet. Blackberry and cassis liqueur. Lovely notes of herbs, green pepper and cocoa. Admirable natural structure displays pure fruit character and elegance. Velvety tannins, long crunchy finish. One of the Portugese heritage of modern art. Keep in the cellar for decades. 96+/100."
20650,1751269,"Dark ruby colour with purple highlight. Intensive aroma of blueberry, blackcurrent, herbal notes mint, wild thyme. Complex and atractive. The palete is rich and opulent with harmony and nice acidity. Fruity and spicy, nice tannic structur, vibrant. Wine with energie. 95/100. "
20651,1751269,"Deep and bright garnet hue. Rich dark berries, plum, vanilla and floral notes. Great fruit driven structure with the perfect amount of tannin to balance it out. Powerful but elegant and great length. Excellent wine! "
20652,1165304,"Someone has to do the job #winelover - taste of the 2013 Noval Vintage only 1200 cases to be released - Pure, class and elegant but a bit more concentrated and muscular than the 2012 - another great port to store for a few years "
20653,1165304,"1,200 cases made. This was a terrible vintage for port, and Noval were one of the few big houses to declare a vintage. Very different to the 2011 and needs more time.   Much spicer and more oaky than the 2011. Blueberry, cinnamon, clove, char, prune jam, raisin, blackberry, cherry. Black currant and raspberry jam. Softer than the 2011, lacks the power and intensity. "
20654,1165304,"I’ve been looking for the chance to sample a young vintage port. This 2013 proved softer and easier to drink than I imagined.  Dense purple. Rich black fruit, blackberry, black cherry and prune, with cinnamon and clove spice. It’s a little floral at this age. The sweetness, acidity, tannins and alcohol vie for supremacy. Painfully young, but still enjoyable. I could imagine trying this with roast beef, or a bittersweet dark chocolate tart.  Enomatic sample at Hedonism, London."
20655,1165304,"Ok, pretty much impossible to swallow at this stage, but what a wine this will be. Just wow"
20656,1165304,"Elegant yet complex, with juicy currants, licorice, spice and cedar. The only fault here is that I opened this too early. This will evolve over time and become even better."
20657,1165304,Still too dominated by a sharp spiciness which will settle over time.  But nonetheless appealing and softened by lovely sweet red fruit.  Doesn’t feel like a strong vintage.  But I wouldn’t say no if you offered me a glass!
20658,1165304,"👁 deep Ruby  👃🏻 burnt, overcooked, jammy black fruit, particularly plum.  👅 sweet, with between 100–1 20 g/L residual sugar, 20% alcohol, very high acid, lots of soft, plush tannins.   Decadently rich black fruit. Delicious. "
20659,1165304,"Deep ruby with purple rim. Blackberry, raisin, prune, leather, ginger, orange peel, vanilla, licorice, molasses, pepper, coffee. Med+ finish with the cocoa tones and a bit bitterness on the palate. Bold, med+ tannin, offdry. Unfiltered, lots of sediments & skins. Still vibrant, need more years. 4.2."
20660,1165304,"Well developed with deep flavours, moderate tannins and a long finish"
20661,1165304,"Unlike restrained 2014, this one is a bit more open, but still too young. The nose is a bit funky, the black fruits are bruised and oxidated. The palate is more friendly then 2014, but still not impressive. "
20662,1165304,Not particularly my taste. Very perfumed palate and nose. Moderately sweet and soft alcohol. Elegant though. 
20663,1165304,"Not ready to drink now, so aggressive & young"
20664,1165304,Concentration and dense. Some tertiary character. A bit meaty. Big tannins. 
20665,1165304,"Very cherry and cocoa. Bomb in mouth with loads of tannins, intensely sweet and highly alcoholic. A very young porto vintage from a textbook growing season."
20666,1165304,"There is potential here! Still young, but already great! The tannins are still a bit rough but will well develop with time. Not too much sweetness and good acidity. Great finish that will become a 5/5 in few years in my opinion! Cheers 🍷"
20667,1248279,"[João Portugal Ramos visit: 6/8] Interesting blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional with plenty space for fruit thanks to a restrained 6 months on oak.  Earthy and herbal nose with red & black cherry and blackberry followed by a supple, smooth palate with beautiful, fresh acidity, integrated tannins, blackberry and nice finish. 4.2"
20668,1248279,"Really aromatic red, with powerful earthy and leather notes yet warranting a beautiful fruity complexity (plum and blackberry are particularly notable)."
20669,1248279,"4.3 in my opinion. This is much better than I was expecting. Its fruity character is amazing, complex and delicious. Well balanced and smooth although its full body. Succulent. Long finish. Highly recommended."
20670,1248279,Medium bodied and fruity. 
20671,1248279,"Deep intense dark cherry colour, nose is mild pleasant aromas of blackberries and plums, powerful, meaty with soft tannins and well balanced. "
20672,1248279,"Nice basil nose, not too bad. "
20673,1248279,Balanced and smooth
20674,1248279,"Dark fruits notes, bold on the mouth and really pleasant. Great surprise!"
20675,1248279,Change to white 
20676,1248279,A nice one for a Wednesday evening. Not spectacular but good. 
20677,1248279,"This wine is another example of why Portugal is one of those wine worlds which are just fun to explore.  This wine is 85/15 Baga/Touriga Nacional. Fermented in stainless, aged 8 months in French oak. Located in the inland northern half of 🇵🇹 on a site that has been in the family since the 12th century!  Pleasant and earthy with focus on dust, leather, mint, tarragon, and dark fruit. Full body with strong tannins and acidity which mellow with time. Great structure and balance.  An easy rebuy!"
20678,1248279,"Smooth, some what sweet with a fine bouquet and wonderful aftertaste. Highly recommended."
20679,1248279,Very exiting and full bodied wine. The first I had from this region. Very balanced nice dark fruits velvety tannin some oaky notes. I am would like to have more. 
20680,1248279,"80% Baga, 20% Touriga Nacional. This wine is so interesting in that the taste disappears almost instantly! It’s very light bodied, very dark in color, & amazingly the taste vanishes quickly. There’s no finish, no mid-taste.   It’s not bad, very smooth, zero complexity. Dark fruit is all I can pinpoint before it’s gone. Tasty but zero persistence. Must be the Baga grape.  Tasty but almost doesn’t seem like an alcoholic wine with the zero bitterness, tannins, or finish. Ergo not suited for sipping or food."
20681,1248279,"Quinta de Foz de Arouce Tinto 2013 is a bold Portuguese wine made with Baga and Touriga Nacional. Like many other big reds this pairs exceptionally with game and a beef stew. The nose shows you plum, leather, and tobacco that also shows up on the palate with additional pepper and red fruit."
20682,1206377,"#vinet2019 An explosion of aromas from the glass, all classical Port vibes but here in a youngsters suit. Fur the product you get, cheap but you must have patience....."
20683,1206377,"Fonseca Port was founded in 1822, grew rapidly and maintained by successive generations of the Guimaraens family. Aged for 20 months in oak and has about 100 grams of residual sugar. Wow grabbed a taste of this youngster. Big and powerful with great fruit structure and complexity. Ripe fruits, cherry, currants and jammy tones, well balanced at its young age. A powerhouse of tannins, lingering and elegant. Need to wait 10 years before you can appreciate its finesse. Tasting Sample."
20684,1206377,"94 closed smell, fine and delicate, shows long and fine finish. WS 97, RP 97"
20685,1206377,"Absolute heaven. Drank way too early, drank 5 years old and it is velvet , black fruits, prune, plum, elegant. Couldn’t believe it. "
20686,1206377,"Velvety, heavy and enough to corrupt a righteous person, caramel aromas pair with blueberry, dark plum and açaí, cinnamon, exotic spices and fruit tart.  Starting mid-palate, traces of graphite and copper start to lift through for an edgy contrast that’s very unusual.  Rich and surprisingly easy to drink, the finish extends for a very long time with the warm caramel, exotic spices and a fairly firm graphite presence throughout the length."
20687,1206377,"This beautiful 2016 vintage port offers scents of sweet ripe blackberry, & blackcurrant reduction. Broad, powdery tonge-coating tannins & a beautifully matched acidity form the backbone for the flavors of ripe black cherry, blackcurrant, charcoal & light oak. Extremely long finishing, it’s a true delight to sip. me96, ws97, we97, rp98 "
20688,1206377,A light orange nose yields to earthy blackberry seeds dipped in white chocolate.
20689,1206377,"Big and firey, but that's to be expected from a wine that's still a baby. Right now it's very fresh with loads of ripe red and black fruit and a liquorice finish."
20690,1206377,"Very dark purplish ruby red colour. Moderately intense nose of black raisin, prune, tobacco, and baking spice. Sweet to very sweet palate reflective of the nose with additional molasses and fig notes; acidity is medium. Very full bodied with moderate, fine tannins. Very long finish with strong cedar and tobacco notes with a tannic astringency. High price ($80 CAD for 375 mL) yet good value."
20691,1206377,"Violets, anise, rich dark chocolate, sun dried black fruits, black cherry, earthy, some Seville Oranges, too, cedar.  Lush mouthfeel, gripping tannins, a little herbal and spicy. Long, drying, deep black fruits finish."
20692,1206377,Incredible vintage that already shows what it will grow into 50 years from now. Enjoyed this one with my best friend hoping we coukd have opened another bottle as we finished the first! Really impressive - look forward to trying in 30 years!
20693,1206377,Plum and blackberry on the nose. Mineral backbone with a soft and elegant texture.

20697,1198370,"Sweet ,jam and ripe blue and red fruit at first, not unlike primitivo , plenty of sunshine and spice.  Earth and herbal notes. The wine is shining after an hour or two in air. Tobacco, stewed plum. Bracing acidity, grainy tannins and herbal ,balsam. Ripe and big yes but the gripping acidity and lively tannins give plenty of fresh and food friendly wine."
20698,1198370,"Ripe red fruit, balsamic, liquorice. Smooth, fresh, mineral, enveloping, good passing. Elegant, delicate finish with fruit, spices, toast. Long"
20699,1198370,"3.75 - 4 ⭐️ Concentrated dark fruit, but not overpowering, with a little vanilla. Really enjoyable and perfect for cold winter nights. "
20700,1198370,"One of Alentejo finest. Relatively expensive for a Portuguese wine but very very good, fruity, full, lots of taste.  If you see it, just buy it! Don’t hesitate! "
20701,1198370,"From Fita Preta winery, made under guidance of António Maçanita, with typical alentejo grapes, 40% aragonês (tempranillo), 30% alicante bouschet and 30% trincadeira.  Nose of cherry, black cherry, blackberry, blueberry, oak, tobacco and vanilla. Well balanced, soft and silky in the mouth, with a long and tasteful aftertaste.   It went superbly with cabrito ao forno (roast goat) this easter.   Nice representative of alentejo wines, 4.0."
20702,1198370,"Clear, deep purple red. Nose is clean, medium intensity with aromas of dark berries, oak, black pepper and a sort of balsamic note. Dry, medium tannins, high acidity, full body. Wait a bit after opening and then try it with red meat. "

20704,1198370,"Super delicious.  It has a deep ruby-mahogany colour - can’t see through it at all...delicious blueberries with tobacco smoke, pepper and dark berry finish.  Super dry, let this one breath for an hour or so before drinking....definitely gets better as it sits! "
20705,1198370,"Explosion of ripe dark fruit, plum, cassis, and blackberry. In the background there’s hints of liquorice, leather, and chocolate. Some herbs like thyme and Rosemary if you like give it a pleasant complex sensation. "
20706,1198370,"Ruby-red color in the glass. Raspberry, vanilla, plum, raisins, thyme and cherry in the nose accompanied by iron and white pepper on the tongue. Medium minus body, medium acidity and medium plus tannins. Overall, a great Portuguese Red. Good complexity and body, just a beautiful drink. (4.0)"
20707,1198370,"Medium ruby color. Blackberry, leather, violet, boysenberry, clove, black pepper, black raspberry, and bramble jam nose. Dry. High acidity. High tannins. Boysenberry, white pepper, clove, bramble jam, black raspberry, and black cherry. Leather finish. This wine will impress a lot of people. Nice jam notes but still dry. Rotundone (peppery notes) make this a winner for me. 3.9⭐️  40% Aragonez, 30% Alicante Bouchet, 30% Trincadeira "
20708,1198370,"A rich southern Portugal blend:    40% Aragonez (Tempranillo)    30% Alicante Bouschet    30% Trincadeira, having a dark violet hue, with a ruby rim, fat legs, and a big spicy, dark berry nose; a smooth, med+ body, 14.5% ABV, of jammy raspberry, plum, and sour cherry, with a touch of tobacco and spice, a light acidity and elevated tannins; finishing somewhat short, tart and chewy. Paired well with an old-fashioned meatloaf, mash and gravy. "
20709,1198370,"Tasting in a winery. Despite being young wine, it has good mature bold body, medium acidity, with cassis and oaky nose and dry plum pallete. Nothing outstanding, though really solid and well balanced."
20710,1198370,"Dark ruby, full bodied and powerful, with black fruit and chocolate aromas. Acidity is high, tannins are quite astringent. At $20.95 this punches above its weight.  40% Aragonez (Tempranillo), 30% Alicante Bouschet, 30% Trincadeira.  Le Sommelier mixed case."
20711,1198370,"Big Alentejo wine..classic Alentejo varieties of Aragonês, Alicante Bouschet  and trincadeira. Warm fruit flavors with notes of spice. Definitely decant before drinking, it needs breathing space 😉"
20712,76439,"93/100 One of Portugal's finest producers. Made from foot trodden grapes and aged in large oak casks. This is 90% Alicante Bouschet and Trincadeira. Fantastic red wine with notes of red fruit, raspberry, black herbs, and pepper. Svelte mouthfeel with impeccable balance and elegance. This tastes incredibly young, it shows no aging. Long and peppery finish. "
20713,76439,"Needs to breathe a lot. 1.5 hours later you can feel notes of raspberry and chocolate, but the downside comes when alcohol is overpowered. Nonetheless, amazing wine."
20714,76439,"🇵🇹 Maravilhoso Alentejano, vestido granada denso, bouquet fruta vermelha e preta madura em compota, notas especiadas, florais e baunilha, palato encorpado, volumoso, fresco, guloso e potente, taninos robusto e acidez viva, termina médio longo e persistente.  🇬🇧 Wonderful Alentejo, dense garnet dress, ripe red and black fruit bouquet with jam, spicy notes, floral and vanilla, full-bodied, voluminous, fresh, sweet and powerful palate, robust tannins and lively acidity, medium long and persistent finish."
20715,76439,"Tremendous wine. Opens with heavy oak on the nose. Full bodied but good tannins and right acidity. Dark fruit, dark chocolate, some spice and smoke too. Marvellous wine, superb finish with leather notes. Let it open and it's a wonderful journey!"
20716,76439,"My comments from the previous tasting still remains. However the experience has been particularly enhanced this time, as I have decanted it 7 hours prior, on the recommendation of the producer when I bought it. It made all the difference! The wine truly opened up and the time helped giving it a more defined structure. The finish is highly chewy with tannins out of this world!"
20717,76439,"Of intense garnet colour, this majority blend of Alicante Bouschet (and some bit of Trincadeira) shows fruit aromas of blackberry compote, with notes of ripe olives, mint and spice. Spicy indeed after some air and oh, my...that exuberant tannins in this benchmark expression of Alicante Bouschet in the complex cult wine of Alentejo. It's never much prized in native France, but here it thrived big time. Adventure begins when you leave enough time for it to unfurl (say 2-3 hours). Super special. ABV 14%. "
20718,76439,"Delicious red blend, this vintage from Mouchão. Great expression of dark fruits, with oak well integrated & notes of spices, tobacco  and smoke. Enjoyable now, but it will beb better in future. A bomb in evolution!"
20719,76439,"Alicante Bouschet (so I think), this is a bitter wine with complex but dense flavour. The first impressions are not the best, but the evolution is very good. Enjoy with wild game, red meat and similar. But enjoy :)"
20720,76439,A Fruity well balanced Alentejo with nice tannins and a medium long Finish! Good to try!
20721,76439,Big flavour; tannins for structure
20722,76439,"Decanted eight hours, this Alentejo blend is still a bold yet irresistible beast. Black, red berries, pepper spice, woodsmoke. Balanced acidity with ripe fleshy tannins. This will be a 4.5 star wine in 5-7 years. I plan to stock up. Saúde! "
20723,76439,"92 points - medium dark purple; nose of rubber, succulents, and red fruit; taste of raspberries, licorice, black pepper. Lovely balance. Good finish."
20724,76439,"This was an outstanding wine. Bold but smooth and silky, notes of dark fruits and vanilla with a slightly spicy finish"
20725,76439,"This is what Alentejo is all about! It takes you straight to those hot summer days in the countryside. It’s a big, bold wine. AMAZING nose, of pepper, oak and black fruit. A touch too acid, but well integrated. It’s just beautiful. Goes straight to the top wines I would give to someone who wants to start in Alentejo wines."
20726,76439,"Very puristic, fresh and elegant, but still powerful wine. This wine is more on the red fruit side, while the Tonel No. 3-4 shows more black fruit. "
20727,1886826,Fruity and good wine
20728,1886826,Well balanced. Woody notes (maybe oak).
20729,1886826,"Good value Black cherry, dark chocolate "

20731,1886826," Nice, from Alentejo, Portugal"
20732,1886826,"The bottle says a lot about this wine. You get sold by looking at it. It’s very “old land” type of characteristics. Very terroir, with earthy notes, minerals and a tad salty. It’s dry with strong tannins and also fruity. On the nose we feel blackberry and blueberry along with licorice and black currant. Flavors are similar, but softer. Good match with steaks and poultry. "
20733,1886826,"Deep ruby red colour with purple edges. Ripe dark plums, vanilla and ripe dark berries on the nose. Taste of ripe dark plums, vanilla and dark berries. Hints of oak. Well integrated and long tannins with a long and dry finish. A very good wine that goes well with beef, mature cheese or game."
20734,1886826,Color: nice ruby violet color  Nose: medium intense fine fresh flavor of ripe black fruit as black currant a mild sweet flavor as well  Taste: medium body and flavor of black cherries and currant mild tannins in a pretty good and long after taste 
20735,1886826,"Dark violet, nuances of ruby. Nose is intense, perfumed. Prominent, vulgar, oak. Red cherries, black plum. Floral notes of violet. Sweet dark chocolate. Palate has medium+acidity. Medium, soft tannins. Medium intensity and length. A bit to perfumed and oaky, distrubing the balance. Nose has complexity.  Good quality"
20736,1886826,"Deep ruby color.  Nose is rose, violet, ripe fruit skin, ginger, clove, cinnamon stick, gamey, black fruits (a bit cooked).  Palate is dry, high acid, high tannin, high alcohol, very ripe fruit, full body, though a medicinal/chemical aftertaste that was unpleasant.  Lower rating because of the level of chemical interaction - would love to taste again in case it was just this bottle..."

Can drink now, suitable for further aging Blend of alicante bouschet and syrah, 50/50. 225L barrels for 12 months."
20739,1886826,Beautiful! Oaky vanilla blueberries! Amazing value
20740,1886826,Warm terroir red; fruity
20741,1886826,Even with this a bit tacky 50-shades-of-whatever label it still is a good Shiraz!
20742,1395714,"Smooth, light, some nice berry flavours. Good option for summer."
20743,1395714,Must breath... and then becomes excellent. Wooden and a bit acid. 
20744,1395714,"Reserva 2004 - Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Barroca by Enology of Jorge Osório. This wine against his age looks pretty good with the primary flavors faded are well highlighted tertiary aromas acquired by bottle stage. Earth, leather, balsamic, herbs, oak and vanilla. The stars: 3,5 for the wine + 0,5 for character, personality and longevity"
20745,1395714,Almost a 4*. This is a wine of depth. Dark ripe fruit with a deceptively lighter colour. I think I’ve had it before and I’d certainly buy it again. Probably best with a substantial meal. 
20746,1395714,"Very extreme surprise. Real cheap and great wine. Good consistency, good colour and a little fruitful. It has a lasting flavour to oak. Must breath for about 1 hour."
20747,1395714,"Ruby red color. Aromas of dark berries, ripe raspberries, blackcurrant, jam, mint. On the palate similar as in the nose with high concentration and silky ripe texture. Dry, high acid, alcohol and tannins which are softened by the ripeness, full body, medium flavor intensity. Very good douro wine."
20748,1395714,Somewhat more complex than the 2009 I rated a while back. Light and fruity on the tongue and wonderfully dry aftertaste. Good for both heavy Christmas dinners as well as cheese.
20749,1395714,Enjoyed this wine onone of our last nights vacationing in Portugal.  Dark in color very aromatic and smooth.  Great price as well
20750,1395714,"Champagne special night, sharing an Armand de Brignac brut rosé magnum bottle with Antonio Fernando Nunes, Cesar Borelli, Daniel DLZ Dalzochio, Edson Zveibil, Luis LOKC Costa, Luiz Renato Breviglieri and Nilton M1ll1umm Vieira. Vinheria Percussi, May 26.  Welcome red intruder by @[1|4563240|Luiz Renato Breviglieri]  Rich in aromas, complex and delicious in the mouth... ""donkey's head"" always surprising.  Rate 4.3"
20751,1395714,"Easy and drinkable wine: pleasant vanilla scent, dry and good structure and enjoyable tannins.  One may call it overoaked but after decanting it's just right. "
20752,1395714,Classical DOURO red wine. Age it between 5-10 years to obtain a good balance between the aromatic and the flavouring complexity.
20753,1395714,Very ruby color. Black fruits with a bit of pepper at the end.
20754,1395714,"Supermarket series, I have always looked at this bottle before but for some reason didn’t buy it, I was quite surprised by it today. 👃 fantastic, moderate with notes of mint, dark chocolate and a fantastic mix of raspberry, honey and vanilla at the end. A really good scent.  🍷 medium bodied but if feels extremely light, good acidity almost as if it wasn’t present, great texture and good tannins. The price to quality ratio is superb, you don’t need to pair it with food. Enjoy ladies and gents. "
20755,1395714,"This is a big, up-front red from the Douro. Clearly-defined notes of dark cherry, black fruits, some spice and pepper, some (not too much) oak, a bit of earth and leather. Great with meat dishes (we had hamburgers) and cheeses. Drink it now. "
20756,1395714,"Intense cherry red wine. Intense nose with red and black fruits, pepper, cinnamon, earth; complex. Balanced acidity, high smooth tannins, full body, powerful, spicy and earthy, long finale. Powerful and rich douro with fresh fruits."
20757,1323234,"Like a velvet cloth slipping over into a misty canyon, effortlessly sliding it's way down through to the staunchest and most stagnant aromatic layer just before being bogged down in a rich turmoil"
20758,1323234,"Complex nose with plum, black currant, sour cherry and raspberry and notes of smoke, leather and baking spice. A nice balanced medium body with red fruit and black fruit flowing through onto the palate with a lingering spicy finish with sweet ripe cherry. A delightful blend."
20759,1323234,Remarkably smooth. Fruits. Rounded 
20760,1323234,"A cherry predominant blend, young plum flavours too. A subtle mouldiness underlies it all. Light tannin structures. A pleasant surprise."
20761,1323234,I love! Lot's of cherry and plum. Nice a light.
20762,1323234,Decent douro for under $20 had everything would buy again 
20763,1323234,"Medium bodied with smooth tannins and a dry mouth feel with flavors and aromas of dark berries and plum, oak and cinnamon spices with a lingering aftertaste "
20764,1323234,Cannot fault this...
20765,1323234,Reminds me of a pinot noir...cherry with spice on the nose....sweet cherry and plum on the pallet  with a light weight body 😂... very easy drinking! Eating some salad with northern cape perdeberg karoo skaap tjops! 
20766,1323234,"Great Portuguese wine, spicy overtone almost Zinfandel like."
20767,1323234,I'm liking this more than last time I drank it.   
20768,1323234,"Dark fruit, vanilla plum very soft on the palate"
20769,1323234,"A little bit lightly, but good"
20770,1323234,I'm very new to non sa wines but this was great. Smooth with a great pallet. Not too much nose
20771,1323234,Blackcurrant red ruby smooth red with good color my rating 3.6
20772,1175699,"Young vibrant wine. Delicate fruity flavours apple, peach, pepper passionfruit with a zesty elegant lemon & lime finish. Still a great wine! "
20773,1175699,Floral aromas with some minerality and grapefruit. Dry and just outright stunning wine with a good but of fruit and creamy mouth feel.
20774,1175699,A heady white offering gorgeous texture/richness on the palate with distinctive notes of apricot-peach-nectarine and firm mineral spine. Can't wait for the next bottle. 
20775,1175699,"Very pale, with a super fresh nose. VV spritz followed by slight apricot taste with stronger citrus, mineral taste. Acidic without being sour, this has a surprising heft for a VV."
20776,1175699,Really stunning wine. Delectable nose of lemon and lime pith with a touch of jasmine which becomes more pronounced. Palette is minerally and white flower driven. Could drink this all day. 
20777,1175699,"Very lovely “vinho Verde”. It’s dry enough and yet very tasty, like a Chardonnay. Notes of green apple, cantaloupe, pear. Long finish. Lovely with clams, seabass, crab meat. Surprisingly it can take “heavier” fish food."
20778,1175699,"My first Albarinho from outside Galicia, but actually just in the Portuguese border. Great  great wine, came from a small winery, almost ecological that explain the natural taste. To the nose tropical and full of mineral. Some mandarin hints and intense to the palate. Serve pretty cold 10C. . Perfect for mediterranean fish dishes or seafood like king grilled king prawns"
20779,1175699,"Great Alvarinho wine from Soalheiro! Fresh vibrant and structured! Great Alvarinho. Bit citrus, pineapple! Bit dry! Very fruity! Balanced mineral! The “primeiras vinhas” is even bette! Highly recommend!  My favourite Alvarinho! This one is from 2016  Excelente Alvarinho soalheiro! Fresco, vibrante e estructurado. Citricos e ananas. Um pouco seco. O primeiras vinhas e ainda melhor! Altamente recomendado! Este e de 2016!"
20780,1175699,"Spotting this On a Wine List; I thought I was ordering a mistyped Albarino from Spain but when the bottle arrived to the table; it actually was an Alvarinho from Portugal! & This is not your typical light & thin Vino Verde; but a medium bodied Summer white that is an unexpected surprise for any Summer occasion. Zesty Melon like flowers, loads of white pepper and bundles of white shallots with hints of minerality here and there plus balanced acidity. It’s just superb. "
20781,1175699,"Clear with a green edge on colour. Nose of citrus, herbs and white fruit. On the palate, there is lovely citrus, pinapple and gooseberries (almost sparkling feel to it). Dry, refreshing and crystal clear crisp fruits, it's simply a brilliant Alvarinho! A nice and lovely mineral/herby finish. Brilliant with shellfish!"
20782,1175699,"What a beautiful wine. Nose of ripe peaches and tropical fruits. Palate with beautiful acid holding the fallouts of stone fruit, minerals and slight spice giving this dry white the illusion of sweetness. "
20783,1175699,"Clean, fresh, salty sea air, reminds me of the sea. I don’t normally enjoy Albariño/vinho verde but this is quality & I keep on coming back to it & really enjoy it. Worth ageing for up to 5 years so say the Wine Society. "
20784,1175699,"Had this about a year ago and tried another bottle to see if short term aging had some benefit. Often referred to as the ""Green Wine"" of the Vinho Verde region with a concentrated fruit character with notes of pepper spice. Lively acidity gives this wine a zesty boost turning the fruit into a complex dry wine with character, apple and citrus, smooth and well balanced on a lingering finish. Wine developed deeper character, very nice! Great value. A Fav!"
20785,1175699,"No. 2’ Wine Pairing 2/7 Would have guess Sauvignon Blanc if tasted blind, but this was a delish Vinho Verde with Alvarinho.   Nose: Stone fruit, grass, citrus, oak. Palate: Crisp attack of grass. Oily finish.   Perfect pairing with delish scallop tartar and dill emulsion. Worked so well together. "
20786,1175699,"Nearly 2 years since I last rated this lovely Monção e Melgaço Alvarinho. It only seems to improve. I see there are positive ratings for 20 year old bottles on Vivino! A remarkable wine. Apricot and peach fruit, lime peel acidity, infused with minerals. Dry, intense, elegant and refreshing. Great on it's own, or with seafood.  Wine trivia: The Quinta de Soalheiro is about as far north as you can get in Portugal. The name Soalheiro is derived from the Portuguese for ‘sunny place’."
20787,45244,"Leather, tobacco, plums and a general bomb of flavour on the nose. Very fruity mouth, Ribena style on the mouth but well rounded and good tannins."
20788,45244,"Dark, deep purple (opaque). Earthy, almost cabernet-like nose. Blackberry, prune and cedar. Very easy tannins and nice acidity. Good wine!"
20789,45244,"Big, Bold Douro. Deep red pour, almost brown. Plum and leather nose with a big taste of blackberry, smoke with a mild pepper finish. Big !!!! "
20790,45244,Still good. Tried this at the winery in Portugal with @[1|14865494|Jamie Hayward] and brought a bottle back - always adds to a wine when you’ve been to the winery 
20791,45244,"Dark ruby in colour. Floral notes of violet and expressive aromas of some ripe fruits On the palate- some leather, earth and a hint of black fruits with a touch of sour red fruits. "
20792,45244,"Wow. What a wedding wine. With a special Four Seasons label this was a great house red.  Best drunk normally, it functioned very well for the numerous ‘Bottoms Up’ throughout the evening.   "
20793,45244,Strong red fruit and some black fruit notes. Few signs of ageing do it no harm as compensated by the pronounced primary flavours. Soft tannins but full bodied and with a persistent finish.
20794,45244,"Heavy initial flavors of dark plum, blackcurrant and dark Cherry, then guys back with a medium to fill body tannin of the pucker finish.  Slight hints on spice, vanilla and and earthy nose. Great dark purple color, and think spider legs in the glass.  Another great Portuguese Douro!"
20795,45244,"Degustação Mania de Vinho por Art des Caves em 16/07. Um dos 4 portugueses degustados apresentados pela Qualimpor.

20796,45244,"Had this at our sales kickoff at the ME hotel in the strand. Went for the beef (slightly over done) and this wine over shadowed the main course. Red fruit flavours and lots of oaky woody spice. Tastes Raspberry and dark cherries but it’s the long, smooth & oaky finish that makes the difference. Extra half ⭐️ for exceeding expectations as I always expect the worse at big hotel events...and this was a very solid and respectable wine to have with a chunk of beef 👍🍷🇵🇹"
20797,45244,"Four stars because of the price to quality equation - it was less than ten euros! How? It’s outstanding. A genuinely ‘vibrant’ wine. (I stole the word off the bottle because it’s right!) The more Portuguese wine I try, the happier I am. Red fruit, autumn hedgerow berries and spices in the back. What blows my mind is the craft in this, great ‘volume’, (I think I know what they mean?) It’s kind of chic, elegant - sophisticated even. It’s was only born in 2017. I want to meet it’s older relatives! Obrigado!"
20798,45244,"I don’t drink much Douro but really loving this. It’s bold with rich fruit and working perfectly with my cheese board. Lovely blackberry and plum, smoke tobacco and leather with a bit of olive. Dry, full bodied, med + acidity and tannin. Well worth the money and for me an interesting change to the norm! "
20799,45244,"A bold red wine with red fruit such as strawberry and cherry to complement darker fruit, plum, blackberry and black currant. Earthy notes with leather, a touch of oak. High flavour intensity with a long lasting finish. Excellent wine maker and typical style of Douro done well. Given the price this wine represents very good value for money. Pair with a hearty beef stew."
20800,45244,"Plums and blackberries, smooth and velvety. Finish is slightly dry. Overall a very good option from the Douro region. "
20801,45244,"Fruity rich bouquet and flavour. Pleasant sharp astringency and rich, full-bodied follow-through. Round, smooth elegance with a punch. "
20802,1240543,Opened my first bottle in stock after 10 years of being made. A Douro icon that is ageing well despite not showing as well as other older and younger Chryseia wines are. Still remarkable though and I suspect it just needs 2/3 years to really blossom. 
20803,1240543,Big Douro vintage 2011 tasting. Didnt perform amoung the best in this qualified tasting but surely high quality douro.   Inky and liguorice with blackberries and vanilla oak on nose.  Fullbodied and complex fruity finish. Still life ahead. 
20804,1240543,"Portuguese brunch part 2!  Clear, deep, ruby color with purple hues. Clean, pronounced intensity aromas of, at first, chocolate and blackberry, then, vanilla and maple, with oak and violet. Dry, medium+ acidity, medium+ tannins and medium+ body. Plum, cassis, black olives, chocolate and white pepper. Long finish. Very good."
20805,1240543,"Great Wine !!! Dark and intense ruby colour. Lovely aromas of blackberries, fresh and dried herbs, black stone minerality, prunes and black cherries. Rich structure, full bodied, fine and rounded tannins well-integrated and discreet oak. Elegant, fumé and long velvety creamy finish. Must have it !!!"
20806,1240543,"Super vinho. Redondo, equilibrado. Deep red with the right amount if tanins and acidity. Melhor douro q ja provei."
20807,1240543,"Concentration, beautifully balanced with ripe velvety tannins, very nice dark fruit. Still fresh and at the same time mature. "
20808,1240543,"Ruby red. Strong aromas of chocolate and dark fruit. Full body, low acidity, balanced tannins and lasting taste. Great value"
20809,1240543,"Aniz on the nose, very nice balanced wine, quite special blend of spices and dark fruit. Quite pricey though."
20810,1240543,Top wine...i love it!!
20811,1240543,Great Douro Wine!!!
20812,1240543,"Wonderful Douro Wine, full body, woody and complex"

20822,13305,"Revisiting one of my all time favourite Douros.   For my taste it is just the right amount of acidity with a touch of dryness.  A very balanced wine where the flavour holds itself throughout the entire experience, including a very smooth finish where the balance holds and continues uninterrupted and unaltered.  Have to give it a 4 based on its merits mixed with a bit of nostalgia."
20823,13305,"Medium intensity of ripe jammy fruit. The palate also has some plum, jam, ripe sunny fruit. It is a full body bold wine thats speaks out loud! Tannins are pretty present which suggests i could have drank it a few years from now. Still satisfied to have enjoyed it!! It also has a medium finish"

Loads of grapes but they’ve come beautifully together in a full bodied smokey dark cherry, blackberry, blueberry, ground tobacco, chocolate, earth, liquorice and gentle spice  Yum and super value  Viva Iberuly🇵🇹🇪🇸😍👍🏿🍷"
20828,13305,"Deep purple color, pronounced intensity, clear aromas of black cherry and blackberry, liquorice, raspberry. Present development notes of toast, cedar, leather and tar. Acidity and tannins in medium+, long finish. Still has some potential for aging, but it's very good right now as well"
20829,13305,"Yummy, solid, excellent portuguese wine that displays aromas of wild berries, distinctive red currants and wild flowers. It tastes of tart cherries laced with licorice and red currants with an almost full-bodied, tannic and vibrant roundness that pleases and lingers on. This is a food-friendly wine that for its price is a great deal!"
20830,13305,"Dark red/purple. Dry. Quite light on tannins. Medium acidity adds some juicyness. Smells and taste of jam, marzipan, ripe cherry. Well balanced. Good to lasagne."
20831,13305,Very fruity though dry.  A little jammy with plums on the finish.   Delicious. 
20832,8092469,Nice. Maybe 3.8+. Needs to breathe and warm up. LaTouche ~€18. 4.0 or 4.1 when left a while to open up. Very nice.

20837,8092469,"Deep ruby colour. Black cherry and liquorice on the nose. Dry, full-bodied, medium length finish with spicy and dried fruits notes "
20838,8092469,"Eher speziell für Portugal: ein reinsortiger Rotwein. Schöne Aromen von dunkler Frucht, schwarzer Schokolade und Cassis. Fast cremige Textur, dicht, mit körnigem Tannin und einem ellenlangen, pfeffrigen Finish. Sehr fein.   More specifically for Portugal: a single varietal red wine.  Nice aromas of dark fruit, black chocolate and cassis.  Almost creamy texture, dense, with grainy tannins and a long, peppery finish.  Very fine."
20839,8092469,"4,1⭐Very good Palmela DOC red, a Castelão monovarietal. This was a wine released for celebration the 100th anniversary of the winery. 👀Dark garnet. Abundant and slow tears. 👃Intense and pleasant with blackberry, blackcurrant, vanilla and dark chocolate. 👅Balanced, almost full bodied, dry. Round and well integrated tannins, medium acidity. 🏁Medium-long finish with spices on the aftertaste. 🗒️Let breathe at least 30/40min, it's so worth it.🤤 At ~7,5€ this is definitely a good PQR here."
20840,8092469,"Castelão Christmas (/ Curfew Castelão) #5: Castelão exclusivamente/exclusively - DOC Palmela - vines ~70yo - 'traditional methods' (manual harvest, pisa a pé / foot treading, open lagar fermentation, maturation in French oak) - 13.5% abv - cork FSC - released in centenary year 2020: a certain levity in body, complexity, finish... but draws you in with lovely balance, smoothness of fruit, just a little sultry, salty... becoming more and more drinkable - a fine way to keep the cold at bay."
20841,8092469,"Another beauty left over from our tasting last night - this was a visit to South Portugal! Immediately, you get a strong fruity nose accompanied with the recognition of ""this is strong!"". Black cherry and blackberry, with some oak added to the mix. I'm convinced that there is a type of nutty (hazelnut) finish, but the guys here aren't convinced."
20842,8092469,4/5  Strong cherry 🍒 in aroma and taste. Also I can find some other red fruit(s) - black cherry and raspberry. Medium finish. Very good wine at this price! 
20843,8092469,"Excellent red wine from Portugal. Silky taste, a nice balanced of red fruit, deep red dress"
20844,8092469,"Blackberry, blueberry, oak, thyme and hints of sage."
20845,8092469,"Enjoyable, well balanced wine. Not tannic , smells and tastes actually pretty sweet for a dry wine. Hints of vanilla and red berries "
20846,8092469,"Full bodied, smooth, fruity with black current and cherry with a long lingering taste. On the dryer side. A repeater. "
20847,1702386,"One of the best this year. Not an easy white, distinc flavor of dry fruits and needs some oxigen before being at point. Complex with wood well aged. Its even a good wine to save a couple of years. Had it with fish and sea good. Oisters are a charm with this one. "
20848,1702386, tropical apricot pineapple minerals
20849,1702386,Dens fruit typical for the grape
20850,1702386,"Wonderful white! Even for winter time. All the citrus and fruit, but also with a warmth and full body and a warmth punch of the alcohol... A wine that delivers. "
20851,1702386,Wine5. O regresso.
20852,1702386,WoW!!! Excellent Viognier from one of the best Winery in Alentejo very famous for their red wines. Vibrant acidity and freshness 
20853,1702386,"Interesting Portugal white made from viogner, coming from Alentejo region... Easy going one, not too much complex, highly enjoyable."
20854,1702386,"A great Viognier, aromatic, fruity, nice texture in the mouth with a long finish "
20855,1702386,"Carnival Tuesday wine dinner with Antonio, Carlão, Nilton, Procópio and wives @Antonietta Cucina.  Very elegant! Opaque straw color, honey, pineapple, vanilla on nose, unctuous and rich, medium acidity, long finish.  Rate 4.3"
20856,1702386,"After tasting the red version i had to look for the white!!! What a great wine for the price this Herdade is doing!!! Extra 0.5;)  Pale yellow with green hints, very bright! The nose is mineral and very tropical, is full of ripe pineapple!! The attack is not too dry, nice minerality and great acidity, we could easily drink couple of bottles more! There is a hint of french oily viognier that i enjoy a lot! Great winery!!! Great quality for the price!!!"
20857,1702386,"A little bit too oaky, maybe needs some more time in bottle. 8,8 PM"

20860,1702386,"Amazing white wine, so far the best I tried "
20861,1702386,"Best white so far this year, lovely character, demanding, lot’s of citrus- a great wine from a great producer "
20862,1651888,I think I need to add wines like this from Portugal to my recommend best deals. I had this at a tasting a month ago with consistent notes. Very earthy nose with metallic smells with incredible dark fruits on the pallet. Great finish just not very long if I am being picky. What a value for $13.
20863,1651888,Polished red Douro. Well made but lacks excitement in my opinion. 
20864,1651888,Sabor a chocolate amargo
20865,1651888,"A bit light from what I expected from Douro. Fruity, jammy, spicy."
20866,1651888,"3.25 simple aromatic structure somewhat rough tanins. Deep but unrefined, quite typical and no surprise here"
20867,1651888,Cherry licorice and good value for the price 
20868,1651888,"Intenso, encorpado. Complexo no paladar com final chocolate amargo.  "
20869,1651888,Mainly tastes like it was made out of grapes

20871,1651888,"Fruit silvestre notes, dark intenss colour, good body "
20872,1651888,Bold but not too heavy. Very drinkable. 
20873,1651888,"Intense ruby colour, aroma of black fruits and berries. High complexity and persistence.."

20875,1651888,"Volumoso, quente encorpado"
20876,1651888,"Dry, bold, full bodied! "
20877,1240543,"One of my favourite Douro reds, 2014 is 53/47 Touriga Nacional/Touriga Franca & aged 15m in French oak. Superb as always, revisit in 10yrs.  Deep ruby. Very perfumed, rich & complex. Toasty oak spice, ripe blackberry, black cherry, vanilla & bramble. Pronounced aroma intensity w. blackcurrant, crème de mure, violet & liquorice. Developing.  Dry. High acid, high fine tannins & high alc. Rich & concentrated w. blackberry, black cherry, cassis & violet. Leather, liquorice & anise to a long complex finish. Yes!"
20878,1240543,"The only red tasted in #UECatadores was the amazing Chryseia from Douro region, a blend of TN and TF 14 months in. There is not much to tell about this wine, a perfect expression of the region,story of successes.  Deep ruby Nose floral,violets,black and red fruit,black pepper,great vegetable touch i usually find in TF,oak is evident but great integration Dry,med+acidity,amazing ripe and velvet tannin,with structure but not like 2012,self contained, fresh and amazing finish! Already perfect but may improve!"
20879,1240543,"Wonderful Touriga nacional and Touriga Franca blend from Douro. Chocolate, cherries, vanilla and cinnamon aromas and mouthfeel"
20880,1240543,The Chryseia is one the best wines from the Douro r Duero. It is consistently reliable to produce great bottles. Amongst my favorite.
20881,1240543,"I put a lot of hope on this wine for long aging. Its minerality and freshness is beyond words and expresses the future of super, well balanced, top quality Douro wines. "
20882,1240543,"4,2 - Nicely evolved Chryseia. It shows its bold blackberry and sour cherry core. Good tannic structure despite its 7 yrs. it was very nice wine but I had better vintages. "
20883,1240543,A great example of why I love Douro reds. Full bodied with fine tannins. Flavours headed by glazed red cherries and cocoa dust. My only regret is that I may have opened a tad too soon. Give this another 5-10 years and it could be sensational. This is mighty good should you want to drink it now mind you.
20884,1240543,Strong 4.5/5. High in alcohol strength - 14.2%. Bold wine with complex character. Requires at least 2 hours of decanting. Not so typical to Douro wines mild tannins. Long finish. Notes of plum and chocolate. Very much recommended.
20885,1240543,"Very deep purple color. Rich and complex aromas of dark plum and black cherries with some subtle toasted notes. Well structured on the palate with lithe, albeit assertive tannins, which underscore the wine’s ageing potential. The finish has a long aftertaste of attractive, supple fruit."
20886,1240543,"Prats & Symington tasting, wine 5. Such an interesting experience to try completely fresh Chryseia of 2017 and just 3 years older which is expressive and powerful with elegance I’ve never seen in Douro wines. Deep ruby, violet hue. Intense aroma of chocolate, plums, cassis, blueberries, violets, slightly more oak and spices than in ‘17 vintage. Full body, concentrated yet elegant structure with dense and silky black fruit flavours well balanced with firm tannins, concludes with long and persistent finish."
20887,1240543,"4.4 A nice partnership between  Charles Symington and Bruno Prats with the intention to apply Bordeaux wine-making methods to grapes which are traditionally destined for the production of vintage Port. 10 months on new French oak barrels, instead of 20 traditionally for the region. The result is beautiful, more elegant and refined wine. Complex dense nose with lost of black fruits. "
20888,1240543,"Just a phenomenal wine. Highly aromatic and near perfect acid balance. This wine is deeply structured and concentrated. We found an aroma reminiscent of manchego cheese in this wine and though subtle, we found it noteworthy and interesting. Highly recommend this wine. "
20889,1240543,"Oh Portugal. We asked that it be opened upon arrival. On vacation with kids means that the 1.5 hour baby-sitting time limit is not sufficient. As you would expect, tight on arrival. Over time this inky concoction transformed into a superlative Duoro. Purple in the glass. Sediment apparent. Big blossoms of black fruit, violet, and leather with a trace of sweet spice towards the rounded finish. Just terrific, a definite recommend but definitely decant for one hour minimum."
20890,1240543,"4+ Dark and intense with notes of cherries, plum, chocolate, mocha and spices. Rich, powerful and structured palate. Great wine!🔝👍👏"
20891,1240543,"The wines of Douro don't do much better than this.  Dark berry note, full tannin mouthfeel with an abundance of fruit "
20892,1175699,Probably the best classic spicy bacalao white wine ever. Nice acidic balance with green apple and citrus. Hint of some minerals 
20893,1175699,Aromatic. Rich. Fresh. Very well balanced with taste of peach and green apples. Perfect companion with a mixed seafood plate. 
20894,1175699,"Lovely fresh fruit, peach, citrus and spices on the nose, fresh fruit and light dry tannins in the mouth. A very delightful wine."
20895,1175699,"Awesome Alvarinho! In the mouth, notes of citrus with a mineral aftertaste. Good acidity and light body. Excellent Vinho Verde! "
20896,1175699,"Lovely young wine. Light, a bit fruity and mineral. Really good. Maybe not the best fit for cold weather, but.. who cares? :)"
20897,1175699,"A perfect summer-wine; fresch and elegant. Generous with high acidity and notes of peach, citrus, passion fruit and minerals. Well worth its money"
20898,1175699,"Amazing wine for the price. Really delicious with hints of oak, cloves and vanilla. Full bodied white that is refreshing as well! Lovely!"
20899,1175699,"Another one of my favourites today. Normally a sunshine tipple, it’s raining, but sure why not it’s always raining here. Nicely balanced peachy wine! "
20900,1175699,Clementine and lemon make this wine a citrus bomb. A bit on the dry side with a touch of salt. Utterly perfect for ocean side sipping or bougie day drinking. 
20901,1175699,A fresh citrus smell I nose combined with exotic fruit. A very typical Alvarinhotaste. So nice and for me one of the best in the world of white wine. 
20902,1175699,"88 Aroma had yellow stonefruit, peach and lime. Over the palate came apricots, coconut, yellow stonefruit and lime. Medium acidity, low tannins and dry."
20903,1175699,"Astonishing wine. This is a  great, typical Albariño. Fruity with that pungent acidity that goes so well with grilled fish and sea food. Good balance, long aftertaste."
20904,1175699,"Wow! What an impressive and rich nose. Pear, clementine, passion fruit and hints of nectarine. Palate confirms the nose, adding a round but still fresh feeling, poise and an exciting, citrus finish. Almost perfect. (9.5 pts) "
20905,1175699,"4.3 - first had it in Lisbon and was very looking forward to try it again in London, it was beautiful. Pale straw coloured, some nectarine notes on the nose when first smelled, more lemon zest, honeydew melon with some stone and saline notes on the palette. Acidic, good minerality, mellow sweetness. We had it with tinned sardines, it was beautiful"
20906,1175699,"Still very young wine, but full of fruity aromas such as peach, pear, tart apples, orange, lemon, elderflower and - honey! A little weak in nose but opens up in mouth with all those lovely aromas. Will probably develop during coming years.  A good companion to my cod with green asparagus,lemon butter and salt marinated capers. "
20907,1105366,"It is a very good wine! The problema is it's price in Brazil! Ut presented a lot of red fruit aromas and flavors, medium body and rounded tannins!"
20908,1105366,"Vanilla and oak on the nose. Sweet on the initial tasting, really nice body and exceptionally smooth. Dark fruits and oak lingering on the palate. "
20909,1105366,"Wow. Full body with dark fruits, sweet liquorice, hints of tobacco/cloves. Well balanced with soft tannins and long finish. Lovely lovely drinker"
20910,1105366,"Lovely wine, with substance, spice and aroma, the white Esporao has long been a favourite but I had not tried the red so far."
20911,1105366,"(4.6) dark red fruits, oak and fresh on the nose. Sweet / soft tannines and tones of pepper on taste. Went wel with hard cheese and gorgonzola."
20912,1105366,I’ve been drinking the 2014 and absolutely loving it. This one is just as good. If you can find it try this wine. Brilliant.  
20913,1105366,For 20 bucks you normally don’t get this value my goodness  It’s full bodied lots of character  Red fruit explosion with cassis tobacco and earthy tones
20914,1105366,"Another very good bottle of Esporão Reserva. No, it is not an outstanding wine, but it has a great price quality ratio and it is very good on it's own. Lovely."
20915,1105366,"(4.3) WOW 😲! Always a great surprise, that never disappoints! High complexity, full bodied, very elegant. Dark and red fruits, intense aromas. An icon from Portugal 🇵🇹!"
20916,1105366,Dark colour; purple rim Nose of blackcurrant; hint of vanilla Smooth intense taste; fruity and balanced; tannins for structure  I am a fan; always a pleasure!
20917,1105366,"Needs to breathe but lovely. Rich chocolate mûres. You really feel the 14,5% to start but with air it it is magnificent with spicy food from Portugal. "
20918,1105366,"Really like this wine. Taste oak, blackberry, and some earth. More on the dry side, with some acidity. Mild bold flavor but light to drink. Dark hue in glass. Long legs"
20919,1105366,"Delicious from the first sip, a great, smooth vanilla finish. Bold and well-balanced, big tannins. Fruity without being juicy. Oak and smoke. A little herbal. But mostly creamy vanilla."
20920,1105366,"Bright red in the glass. Oak, vanilla and spices on the nose. Ripe red berries on the palate. Dry. Full bodied and well structured tannins. Similar to a superb Rioja. Recommended! "
20921,1105366,"Full bodied, full of fruit and depth. Not overripe. Gains in length and complexity with time in the glass. Great QPR and therefore 4.2 from me. Only SA can match Portugal for value "
20922,1138731,"Fantastic. Melon, peach maybe. Bright. Medium to full bodied (legs!). Bracing tartness on finish that is surprisingly enjoyable. "
20923,1138731,"👃Light petroleum,honey and minerals  👄 Nice oaked full body white. Blend creates multiple layers and solid structure. A lot of stone and lemon zest. "
20924,1138731,"Floral and intensely fruity, with peach and nectarine and a citrus finish. Full bodied white, with perceptible oak (vanilla and butter) "
20925,1138731,"Creamy, complex and balanced palate with pineapple, citrus, peach, vanilla, pear and much more. Elegant minerality with a pretty intense finish. High quality ""bang for the buck"" wine! "
20926,1138731,"Lighter than the previous year, esporão reserva branco 2018 is an even better wine. Lighter but not light, good pn the nose and better taste. Very good. Match with some substance."
20927,1138731,Lots of apple and citrus on the nose. Light golden straw color. Similar characteristics as an unoaked Chardonnay. Light butter and pear on the palate. Very easy drinking. 
20928,1138731,"Very nice white, once again another good year. Not so much alcohol 13,5 where in other years was around 15, I have the idea it was sweeter before but although this one is dry, still, it's very full and smooth on the mouth but bold as well. Nose is fresh and fruity and has a long finish. Balanced wood and tropical fruit make it a delicious company."
20929,1138731,"This wine is just getting better and better! High alcohol is probably contributing to the firm and solid body. White flowers, elderberry and shy citrus. The aftertaste is full of vanilla snd smooth lemon. Truly a great Alentejo white. "
20930,1138731,"Pale lemon color. Lemon, pineapple, mango, cream, and vanilla nose. High acidity. Lemon, yellow apple, red apple, mango, cream, vanilla, dried pineapple, and orange blossom. 4.3⭐️ superb.   This wine changes every year (blend, oak, and artwork). "
20931,1138731,"It's just a wonderful wine. An Arinto/ Antao Vaz/ Roupeiro blend, aged in Oak for 6 months. It's a lovely change from Burgundy and other oaked Chardonnays, similar style but a little more fruit on the nose and palate. A little peach giving way to smashed banana but it's all very well done and much more elegant than it sounds. "
20932,1138731,"Yellow colour, Flavours of Apple, gooseberry, grass, tastes of gooseberry, minerals and oak giving it a long aftertaste, wood and grass, dry, medium acidity, bold for white wine, goes perfectly with a pasta-fennel dish"
20933,1138731,"Golden color. Peach, tangerine, orange blossom, and even wet stone to the nose. Rich honey, with a zing of citrus like tangerine, nectarine and pink grapefruit on the end. Overall very well balanced. Had this with a mixed spread of turkey, peach salad and fish and it sufficiently complimented each. Well done."
20934,1138731,"4.5⭐️ for this Portuguese Alentejo 🇵🇹 white wine. 👁 Clear visual with a straw pale color.👃Good aroma with a first sniff dry and fresh with ome flowers and vegetables and a second sniff focused on peach, pear, flower and vegetables. 👅 In the mouth dry wine with good acidity and good balance, retro-odors of white fruits and vegetables. Good persistence in the mouth with long finish. Elegance white wine with good balance and alcohol. Cheers 🥂"
20935,1138731,"Alentejo white blend from highly regarded Esporão.   Quite low intensity on nose carrying mostly tropical fruit and some butter. Alright. Not too impressed.   On palate tho. On palate it evolves into a balanced and complex wine with tones of pineapple, passion fruit, nectarine, white grapefruit, a saline kind of minerality, butter and vanilla. The secondary components are in the background and perfectly balance the primary in a refined and harmonious manner. Very high quality. 4.3. "
20936,1138731,"Herdade do Esporao is an 8 century old terroir in Alentejo and maybe the most consistent producer there.

20939,5610972,"This vintage is heavier than the 2015 in body and some of the secondary notes.  Still have the acidity on the higher side but a smooth layer of vanilla evolves after a few seconds of that first taste.  Initial notes of citrus, orange zest and cedar begin with a medium body.  Nice earthy overtone to everything until the vanilla starts to evolve.  For a bit, the earthy notes and vanilla balance fairly well but the earthy aspects fade first.  Lucky find on this one."
20940,5610972,Wow! Vanilla and sweet pear nose with a light mineral medium dry finish in the mouth. Another great white for hot summers as an aperitif and will pair fantastically with shellfish and seafood.

20958,1157017,"Baga, does it have the potential to be Portugal's Nebbiolo? In the hands of master Luis Pato (and daughter) it is medium ruby, with a funky, feral aroma. Bramble, animal hide, rose and pine. On the palate structure dominates flavour, high tannins, high acidity and stone and clay minerals. Lovely expression of its place. Wine details in comments. Online Wine Tasting Club.  Wine trivia x2: Luis Pato's dad, João Pato, was the first winemaker in Bairrada. Pato is Portuguese for duck, hence the labels."
20959,1157017,"Leather, oak, smoke, warm red fruits. "
20960,1157017,"Jammy black fruits on the med-heavy end of the scale - black plum, black currant, some black cherry offset by notes of rubber, burned wood, walnut and licorice. "
20961,1157017,"A quite uncharacteristic Portuguese wine.  Light- fruity, floral.  Nose of young leather, fresh caramel, liquorice.  Rich and balanced - but lacking in intensity."
20962,1157017,"100% Baga from 50+ yo vines. Deep ruby. Fragrant nose of sweet candies and barnyard. Spicy and punchy palate, with mostly red fruits, spicy aftertaste, straight forward yet pleasant, very long finish"
20963,1157017,"A Baga from Old Vines to remember, especially since it's by Luis Pato! Color similar to Pinot Noir but flavors much more intense. Medium-full body, elegantly smooth & bold, balanced tannins & acidity, lovely medium finish. This bottle hand-carried by a friend from Lisbon, enjoyed it over Insalata Caprese, Tomato Soup, Risotto Sepia di Nero, Grilled Trout, and Pork Chop. Smoke, vanilla, Bing cherry, blackberry, leather, blueberry "
20964,1157017,"Open it at least a good hour before you drink it, then you get rid of the excess tannins and acidity. It becomes then better and better, on the nose and the pallet. Classic baga, pure silk. "
20965,1157017,"Very good wine, not too complex but with its own personality!"
20966,1157017,"Dark, quite sweet and smells of caramel and toffee."
20967,88352,"92 (95) Aroma had raisins, dates, overripe plums, prunes, dark chocolate, vanilla and espresso. Over the palate came black currants, raisins, dates, prunes, dark chocolate and vanilla and candied cranberries. Medium plus acidity, medium minus tannins and sweet."
20968,88352,This is what you would expect from one of Taylor's flagship Quintas. Work in progress given its age but what character already showing through the fruit and tannins.
20969,88352,Smells like milk chocolate with raisins. The some dried fruits and a hint of tobacco. In the mouth intense fruity sweetness is then replaced by stinging alcohol and some tannins. Long finish. Maybe better to wait a few years to fully enjoy. 
20970,88352,"Dark purpur in colour. Red cherries, blackberries, vanilla, prunes, figs, raisins, smoke, and leather in the aroma. Flavour of vanilla, almonds, cane sugar, leather, raisins, blackberries, espresso, and figs. 92."
20971,88352,"92pts me  In years when the overall vintage is not good enough for a vintage declaration, generally the single vineyard vintage port is declared  Rather tight nose and very closed as too young  Violets minty peppery turning towards mulberrieses and fire roasted date and figs.   The alcohol is still slightly not so well integrated but it has a beautiful violet on the finish with medium ripe harsh tannin on a balanced acidity.   This will age for long"
20972,88352,"Fresh nose of blackberries, blueberries, flowers, herbs and dark chocolate. Much fresher and lighter than the 2002. Better too. 92-94p"
20973,88352,94 Very Intensed and powerful. RP 92
20974,88352,"Obviously still very young and hot, but has changed a lot since first trying 3 years ago. Plenty of violets, lush ripened fruits, very earthy with a lot of drying alcohol. Pleasantly warming."
20975,88352,"A great chance to vertically taste the wine 10 years apart, both great in different ways! Deep purple color, smells of oyster shell, India ink, graphite and blueberry, quite mineral, full body with smooth mouthfeel, tastes of dried fig, dried longan, dried persimmon, dried apricot and cinnamon, licorice vine after taste, long finish, powerful and full throttle."
20976,88352,"Great with or soon after a chocolate dessert...it has similar rich chocolate, vanilla and caramel flavors."
20977,88352,Taylor's vintage port masterclass: Dark purple. Starting to change colour. Over 100 g/dm3 of residual sugar. Low acidity. Chocolate and spices nose. Fruit forward. Drink now.
20978,88352,Fantastic but still to young now to drink

20982,1206377,"Secret Santa 2020! 🎅🏻🎄  The 2000 vintage ports are particularly tannic and reserved, and just starting to get exciting. This Fonseca 2000 is deep ruby. Dried blackberry and date on the nose, with woodsmoke, liquorice and tobacco. The palate is grippy and tense, bergamot, violet, nutmeg, eucalyptus. Density here, acidity too, 2000 is going to be a vintage for the ages. Mrs F. loves port in this emergent phase and is delighted with it.  Even better tomorrow?  Thanks Santa, whoever you are! 😀🍷🎅🏻🎄🍷😀"
20983,1206377,Finish lasts forever- and it's fantastic at the start. Deep dark jammy fruit and notes of anise and chocolate. Among the finest port houses
20984,1206377,"Dark purple, nose on blackberry jam, blackcurrant, chocolate, spices. Tannins are getting soft, low alcohol heat feeling, this is very drinkable, the finish is impressive, chewy and long. "
20985,1206377,Always an amazing experience to open such a bottle. The wine still has plenty of plum fruits and richness. Developing walnuts aromas and leather. Medium dry with rich finish. Long length 
20986,1206377,"Deep dark ruby-purple in colour with garnet shades around the rim, intense fruit forward aromas, big black fruit on the palate, full bodied, velvety texture, blackberry, black currant and liquorice flavours, dark chocolate and spices on the long finish."
20987,1206377,"I'm no port expert but I rather enjoyed this. This half bottle was a gift from the manager of my neighbourhood wine shop. How nice of him! Decanted and left overnight, this offered up very rich and heady aromas of figs and raisins. A lot more going on on the palate: hazelnuts, intense dark cherries, figs, macerated plums and chocolate. This had a nice backbone of acidity which kept the flavors fresh throughout. I would say this was very accessible after extended aeration. Paired with roquefort. Classic."
20988,1206377,"Almost black color.  On the nose with aromas of ripe berries, liquorice, some butterscotch and violets.  Soft and round on the palate with silky, well-integrated tannins and lots of fig fruit.  Warm, ripe finale with a long-lasting berry fruit."
20989,1206377,"Said goodbye to a good friend who is moving with this port & good cigars.  18 year old port for a friend that has lived in Dallas 18 years. Just outstanding. Luscious, vibrant blackberries, Long lingering finish, seamless, still drinking very young...many decades ahead in this bottle.  "

20997,1105366,"Dry, red fruit, full bodied and excellent tannin. The Portugal red blends are a superb value. Reminds me of a Priorat for 1/2 the price "

21000,1105366,Blackberries and strawberries on the nose. Medium to high grippy tannins. Nice berry flavours. Long finish. Expensive but just about worth 23 euro ...
21001,1105366,"An international classic style from the beautiful #Alentejo that you cannot miss #winelover - a blend of Aragonês, Trincadeira, Cabernet Sauvignon, Alicante Bouschet - a best friendly to share"

21004,1105366,"Strong nose of wood, raisins, and leather. Notes of leather, mushroom, and plums. Surprisingly silky finnish with some wood notes."
21005,1105366,Most probably the best relationship of price and quality. Full bodied and rich in tannins.
21006,1105366,"Shared by my Dad on his recent visit a blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira, Alicante Bouschet & Cab Sauv. Ageing is 12m in new & used French & American oak.  Deep ruby.

21009,1105366,"#11 from night #2. This a Portuguese blend as served by Nicole. This one had us guessing! Aromas of ripe fruit, cocoa, and vanilla. This is a dense red, rich in flavours of field berries and red plum, and a medium finish. Thanks Nicole!"
21010,1105366,"Um grande vinho portugues, from the Alentejo region! I was quite impressed  by its slow-motion opening up. It is dense, opaque and runs the risk of not being polished if does not rest long enough in bottle. A wine for Autumn.  Aromas of very ripe black forest fruits, violettes. A subtle note of vanilla and heavy on oak-like tertiary notes, including smoke. In mouth, part of this intense 'crianza' is passed and pending to be polished. Bur all in all, this 2010 presents good refinement. Interesting. Elegant."
21011,1105366,"David Baverstock and Luís Patrão…art in the labels…Esporao. Wine in glass reviles deep ruby colour. Swirling the wine in glass…scent reviles black fruit, wet stone, vanilla and spicy aromas with medium minus intensity. In mouth It is robust and very well-structured…I got surprised…positively. It is dry wine with medium plus acidity and tannins structure. It has medium plus body and medium finish.  It is very good wine. Serve it with barbeque meat. One additional note: 1+ hour decant."

21015,1240543,Realty really great!! Soft and round and full on the palate Nice complexity on the nose with the blackcurrent and plummy notes. Also got a touch of almonds at the end  Lovely drop!!
21016,1240543,"One of the beat Portuguese wine I had in life. amazong and spetacular! This red is a beauty! Full of red cherry, rasperry, strawberry, jam. Earthy in the nose. dark ruby color."
21017,1240543,"Punchy nose with big plum with meaty and oily nuances. It packs dense tannins and delivers to be both brawny in structure and silky smooth in texture, underlying ripe blackberry, plum, vanilla and bitter chocolate flavors. Piquant spices on the bold finish, and extremely long."

Bold, complex and deep, with great acidity and length. Deep violet, almost purple color, floral, ripe dark fruits aroma/flavors, specially black currants, blackberry and plum, with notes of cassis, mint, spices, mocha, toast and well integrated oak. Full body, velvety tannins and an endless tasty finish. Delicious stuff, still growing!"
21020,1240543,"Without doubt the best still red Portuguese wine I've ever tasted. It smells of caramel, vanilla, black cherries & waffles! The palate delivers smooth tannins & medium acidity. The initial flavours are all about primary fruit enrobed in cream with a finish redolent of something more complex...fennel, rosemary & game."
21021,1240543,"This wine is different, but crazy good. The Bouquet hits you like nothing I have tried before (a mix of Rioja Gran reserva, Barolo and Port). Its oak, vanilla, strawberries with a hint of Caramel 🤔 And its pitch black. Extremely balanced and smooth. The ‘connection’ between Touriga National and Cab is clear, but with almost hints of green pepper (shiraz?) and butter... Clearly the best Portuguese wine I have had (so far)..."
21022,1240543,"Very dark: max purple, max opacity - glass stainer. Big nose: ripe and dark cherries, stewed plums, leather. Taste is as the nose, great complexity, tannins big but soft, full bodied. Great with steak. 8.2"

21025,1240543,"Really close to excellent. Consumed Jan 2020 - decant for 30’+. Plum, blackberry dominate a very well balanced palate. A bit too sweet to my taste (if you ask me, hints of Port in the colour and body) but a well-deserved 4.25-4.5"

Finish is tannic, youthful and full bodied. Black fruit notes - blueberries and black currant.   Great wine and great example of the touriga nacional grape."
21030,1434566,"A beautifully full Portuguese red, with well blended top notes of oak, vanilla, plum, tobacco, and raspberry, which make for a moderately dry wine which is good value for money. Portuguese reds are quickly becoming my go to if I'm not sure what I want, and this only goes to reinforce my opinion of them. "

The wine is dark purple, quite viscous leaving a light pink film on the glass. Black fruits and butter aroma with a hint of spices. Blueberry, sour cherry, chocolate and spicy notes on the palate. Full body at 14% vol. Dry with soft tannins and low acidity. The aftertaste is similar to a fresh ruby port in a dry version. Dark fruits and spices, that’s what this wine is about. 👍"

21058,1105367,"This Private Collection is amazing!!!  It combines fruits, floral and vegetables!!!!  The high level and standards of this Producer made this wine an Excellency.   With wood, smoky, round and balanced this wine is almost perfection!!!!  Congrats Esporao!!!!"
21059,1105367,"Tasted along with vintage 2013  Beautiful green/yellow colour.   Nose: Fantastic nose - so fat and creamy. Butter is clearly the first hint that pops up. There is also hints of oil, oak, vanilla and burned toast. A lot of tropical notes peach, pineapple, apricot but also apple.  Palate: Creamy structure on the tongue. Acidity level is great and the fruit is well present. The secondary notes from the nose is also present.   So great value and potential in this bottle."

21065,1105367,"Plums, almonds, peaches and honey on the nose. Superb after 15 min breathing, good acidity with a long finish. Fit me, this is one of the best Portuguese whites, with a long life ahead. I would love to try it again within 10 yrs from now. I gave it 94/100. Strongly recommended!"
21066,1105367,"Intense dark ink color, nose of black fruit, plum, forest. Smooth on the mid palate with black fruit jam, sous-bois, a good Portuguese wine that will certainly benefit from cellar time. "
21067,1105367,"Fantastic smooth nose, creamy, buttery vanilla. Like custard. With distinct minerals,  discreete lemon acidity and oak. The fruit is very fresh with yellow apples, apricot and peach.   The taste is fresh, but with significant oak. Lemon, yellow apples. It's a bit flatter than the nose, otherwise the score would be higher. This is 4.1.  I see other reviews mentioning California style, but this sends me to South Africa: Stellenbosch   Great with a shellfish lasagna. "
21068,1105367,"Short notes: oak and butter galore, malolactic fermentation defined. Hate it, love it, I’m firmly in the camp of “use it sparingly” and this completely overdoes it imho. Otherwise decent tropical backbone and good balance with a sharp lime finish. "
21069,1105367,"Have never had this style before; it seemed like a nice wine, but simple to an oaky Chardonnay which isn’t really my style.  Deep gold color, full bodied. Nose of butter, honeysuckle, lemon, and mango. A creamy feel on the palate with pear and more tropical flavors as well as pie crust mid palate.  Rich finish.  I don’t know really know the values of such an unfamiliar wine, but I’d say I probably wouldn’t pay $33 for it again. 6.5/10"

21081,1175699,"Greenish bright yellow. Wonderfull bouquet with flowery notes and tropical fruit. Great acidity perfectly  integrated with the  just the right amount of sweetness. Notes of green apples, pine, passion fruit and (maybe) mango. One of the best years for the alvarinhos from soalheiro in my opinion. "
21082,1175699,"A lovely fresh white accompanying a wonderful lunch in Manila  Pale yellow, full nose, citrus, lime, honey, mineral, pear.  Fresh on the palate, well balanced, high acidity, medium alcohol, citrus, honey, melon, pear, peach and slate on the palate  Simply a beautiful, well rounded and refreshing wine"
21083,1175699,"Very very good vino verde: fresh lemon and minerals, lime juice and a tender skin of a peach, a tiny bit of melon in the aftertaste. Recommend with a great ham/ melon/ balsamic combo or with fresh seafood platter "
21084,1175699,"(4.3) Yellow citrine color, the nose is intense with aromas of citrus fruit and tropical and mineral notes. On the palate melon, ripe apple and pear, crisp and beautiful acidity. Balanced and lengthy. @Okhuysen"

21088,1598998,I’ve never had a 50 Year old Colheita but this was stellar as you’d expect. Viscous and nutty with apricots and dried fruits. Caramel and lovely color!  
21089,1598998,"4.7⭐️ sounds right for this 50(!) year old port!! $300+ a bottle and did not disappoint 😍  The longevity of port truly amazes. This has another decade left in the tank. It just keeps going effortlessly, like Keith Richards 🎸   An intoxicating melange of roasted nuts, candied fruit, creamy toffee, oxidized notes, earthy prune, dried apricots, old oak, damn. Nectar 🍯 of the gods here  Wifey was quite impressed with her bday surprise   Rock Man in the good books 📚😆👍🏻  🎶 pairing: Satisfaction - The Stones 👅 "

21093,1598998,"The 7th Taylor's single harvest port to be released on its 50th birthday hails from a generally declared vintage. This wine aged in wood for 50 years, showing a nose that is a spice-fest, with cinnamon, nutmeg and cardemon. On the palate you get Grand Marnier style orange essence,  cognac notes,  dried fig and honeyed apricots. This is a bold, full-bodied tawny colheita.  Impressive. Rate 4.7"

21098,1598998,"Rating 4000 😳  This is a lovely, complex port. 50 years old, it is not overly woody or dried out, and is rather delicate and mellow. Brown. It smells great, coffee, cinnamon, tobacco and old leather furniture. Fig and prune fruit on the palate, black tea, very vibrant for its age. Balsamic, smoke and chocolate. An endless finish of dried fruit, cinnamon and nutmeg. Good balance of sweetness and citrus peel acidity. Wonderful! Already bought a bottle of the '68, and I won't be waiting for review 5000."
21099,1598998,"Superb colheita... dry stone fruit , apricot, figues ( a lot) , walnut... massive, cocoa, toffee, coffee...  full bodied, crazy length... beautiful"
21100,1598998,"4.7 for sure amazing !  Bought the whole bottle , did not disappoint.  "
21101,1598998,"Excellent port, old but still alive and kicking! Nice acidity, pleasant sweetness, not overwhelming, great balance, lovely bouquet. Absolutely gorgeous! "
21102,4295188,Delicious Portuguese red that is super grippy but well balanced. This outdoes most Napa cabs in the price point.    red fruit and leather with solid oak. 
21103,4295188,"Medium red. Nose of cherries, earth, licorice, some leather/animal notes. Concentrated palate, fine tannins, good length. 88 p"
21104,4295188,Nice smell with  red fruit red cherry in the nose. Soft Fruity taste with  red fruit earthy on the tounge. Soft tannins. Great for just drinking. 
21105,4295188,"Complex wine, coupage of many grapes... provides a profile like Bourgogne white wines... wood, smoky, mineral... very pleaseant!"
21106,4295188,"Ruby to purple color. Full bodied. Smells like liquorice, plum, black currant, leather. Well balanced, and long taste. Thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻 @[1|1503471|Robert Stenmark]"
21107,4295188,"⭐4.0 Medium purple.  Nose: oak, plum, leather. Palette: oak, plum, smoke, dark fruit. Surprisingly bold red Douro.  High acidity and tannins.  Great food wine 👍  "
21108,4295188,"Plum, black fruit, earthy, mineral flavors. Quite complex for an entry-level bottle. It ends on a delicious savory note. Great value and versatile."
21109,4295188,"50% Rabigato, 20% Codega, 15% Gouveio and 10% Viosinho.  From old vines, planted to mica schist. 90% fermented and aged  in used barrel. It has the lemon , mineral punch of Burgundy"
21110,4295188,Nice but didn't open as much as I had hoped.  This was a selection for my wife and the selection was spot on for her palate.  A good deal of earthy notes with pepper and dark berry 
21111,4295188,"Medium purple in color with a medium plus intensity nose. Violet, blueberry, red cherry, potting soil, earth, pencil shavings. Dry, high acidity, medium plus tannins, medium bodied, low alcohol and medium plus intensity on the body. Red cherry, blueberry, violets, leather, earth. Very good quality of wine. Can drink now, suitable for further aging. 3.9 stars. "
21112,4295188,"Steak dinner wine! A solid good value full-bodied Douro blend here that I have not had before but really delivers good quality for the money. Really appealing fragrant nose with air. Spicy, licorice, earthy, leather. On the palate rich and juicy, dark and firm plum and blueberry fruit, full-bodied, fresh, earthy and leathery notes, with nice ripping tannins that go well with the meat, with great acidity to match. Splendid value!"
21113,4295188,"I don’t know if my bottle is wildly different than y’all’s, but the taste profile sliders were WAAAAAY off for me. To me this is light, bright, soft, and dry. Are there tannins? Sure, but it’s not tannic. This is easy drinking but complex. It’s a very interesting wine, but one that anyone can enjoy. On the nose there’s cherry, stewed strawberry, and enough brett scent to make me wonder how they fermented. This reminds of great, natural trousseau. Tart and bright, cherry and tomato, and smooth and delightful"
21114,4295188,"Light fresh and juicy sweet sour cherries. Some earthy tones. Touch of liquorice. A very plesant 12 pst alc. slight pleasant bite in the tannins. Not the most complex of wines, but very food friendly and easy drinking. Great balance!"
21115,4295188,"Great. Discreet and sober aromas and flavors (earthy, fresh black fruit and red fruit).  Violet color, medium dry, some acidity, full-bodied. Advertised as of minimal intervention.  I applaud alcohol at 12.5 ° because it is a moderate value that makes wine more friendly and therefore more gastronomic. Contains sulphites."
21116,4295188,"Lovely, Portuguese blend of six grape varieties, matured in oak for ~1 year and 5 months in vat. Had the 2018 vintage.  Dark red with purple hues. Rich and fruity medium-bodied red with pleasant acidity and soft tannins. Strongly aromatic nose with plum and cherry predominating. Blackberry and leather notes on the palate with a black pepper finish.  So pleasant to drink we hardly realised we’d had the whole bottle!"
21117,2037455,Blueberry bubblegum galore with this one. Calmed down a bit and got more interesting overnight but was both full on and one dimensional at kick off. 
21118,2037455,"89 points - dark purple; mineral nose with less fruit and tertiary notes; taste of black currant, licorice. Good acidity and lengthy peppery finish. Wine is not as bud abarricaríeis as the 2016 and not quite as full bodied. "
21119,2037455,"This is a top-quality blend from the Douro Valley. Balanced, dry, and flavorful. Cherry, a bit of rockiness and earth, with a note of earth and a touch of oak. Excellent with foods, dark chocolates, or by itself. "
21120,2037455,The familia give it 4 *!!!

21122,2037455,Earthy full bodied
21123,2037455,"Very exuberant and elegant. Very balanced in the mouth and aromas of wood.  Dense and smooth with a lot of fruit.  The finish is intense, fresh and long. Great wine at a reasonable price for this quality!"
21124,2037455,"Medium across the board on colour, tannin and acidity.  Flavours are dark red berry, flint, earthy, touch of spices. A dry style with a mid length.  Decent red for the price point and fine to initiate your adventure in to Portuguese reds."
21125,2037455,"deep colour, meaty scent with some burned tones, black berries. Some Touriga N tones and long aftertaste"
21126,2037455,"Nothing to dislike on this Douro red blend (Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz) but, sadly, nothing to get excited about either! There’s some generic dark fruit and a balsamic note but frankly I was disappointed."
21127,2037455,"Great! Good flavors and aromas of fruit (black fruit and red fruit). Oak notes, that gives a sweet sensation, but cuts by a pleasant slight bitter (black chocolate). Ruby / violet color. Full-bodied, medium dry. Overall, on the olfactory / gustatory dimension it`s a pleasant wine. Alcohol in the level 14.°, which, for me, is too much for table wine and a less gastronomic aspect. Contains sulphites."
21128,2037455,Perfect with meat. Great all rounder.
21129,2037455,Tasted on Quinta de Ventozelo in June 2020. Overrated.

21131,2037455,Very smooth and tasty. Had at the restaurant in Porto.
21132,1142986,"Strong on the nose, and a beautiful ruby red colour.  Starts with a bit of a dry bite, but then warms to oak, earth and tobacco notes. Slightest fruit notes, excellent wine."
21133,1142986,"A very balanced wine.  Nothing of note but it gets 4 stars for being a very great calm easy to accept wine that accompanies nearly anything.  Nothing that screams of a Douro wine, but enough of balance to make it through acceptable."
21134,1142986,"Oak, cherry and plum. Sinks me in nicely.."
21135,1142986,"Good Portuguese Douro wine, but just this...good. If you’re a little bit more experienced about Douro wines you’ll fully undestand my short commment about this one."
21136,1142986,Great wine. Dry. Oak. Blackberry. Slightly tannic. 
21137,1142986,Enjoying in Viseu. Had it at Colmeia. Delicious. Smooth plum and vanilla
21138,1142986,"Solid wine for its price point. Dark fruit, oaky and vanilla notes"
21139,1142986,Nicely balanced. Not too acidic. Nice colouring - light - fruity. 
21140,1142986,Very good for a white wine
21141,1142986,Surprised this only got 3.5 rating... for the price it's a steal. Beautiful all-rounder

21146,1142986,Very fruity but balanced. Liked it a lot!  
21147,1206377,"Soil and bark dominate the nose. This is a very unique Port - I had to return to it to make sure my notes were correct. Indonesian curry comes to mind as a pairing, with lemongrass and banana leaf notes  This would make a great pairing with Hawaiian laulau as well, or perhaps a sticky rice dessert."
21148,1206377,"A dark red wine with a simple, strong, sweet, well-defined raisin note with a smooth, long sweet finish with a hint of barrels."
21149,1206377,"Deep, dark ruby, opaque. Nose is dark chocolate,Dutch cocoa, and sweet home-brewed vanilla extract. Stewed cherries at the end of the nose.  Medium body for a fortified wine, so not heavy and cloying. Alcohol makes it hot on the palate and it has a long finish.  Barely any raisin on this. Flavors are more chocolate and rum-soaked cherries. Alcohol is powerful but there is a dry tannic edge to it too.  I wish this weren’t $100+ a bottle as I want more, but I noted on the bottle, ‘not for chugging - $100! 🤪"
21150,1206377,"Very fruity with loads of blackberries, blueberries and cherries. Then very peppery and tight. On the palate it is initially super-sweet but then very tannic, acidic and tight. Right now it is totally teenager clumsy but in 10-15 years it will certainly come together. Hard to rate at this early stage but obviously really great potential. 97-100p"
21151,1206377,2017 is still dense and closed. Great potential once the tannins soften out. Rated 98 points by WineEnthusiast. 
21152,1206377,Very approachable. All the berries on this. Black and blue berry. Sweet but not to much. Nice silky balance. 
21153,1206377,"Sweet, raisin, full body, hint of maple syrup. Approachable now. Well made Port wine."

21164,1591597,"Of loaded purple, accompanied by a purple rim. Palate with plums, and berries. Tannins firm grainy palate give the average strength and structure to the port, leading to grainy but not aggressive end."
21165,1591597,"Beautiful, nicely balanced red that goes well with steak or seafood. "
21166,1591597,"aged in pipas bottled 1 year later than the classic vintage port - intense dark purple color, much on the dark fruits, lovely balance and freshness, very delicate and fine tannins, little spicy note - a very charming wine "
21167,1591597,Couldn't resist drinking this with the Xmas chessboard and what a blockbuster.  Superb concentration and depth of fruit from the the 2011 vintage combined with vines in the Vinha da Pisca being over 80 years old.  Classical rich style with many layers of flavour.  Joyful stuff.
21168,1591597,This is another exceptional vintage port from Niepoort that will be better with time...wait until 2030 or well after to begin enjoying.
21169,1591597,"Deep ruby colour. Pronounced nose with blackberry, blueberry, black cherry, black plum, mint and black pepper. Pronounced taste of blackberry, blueberry, black cherry, black plum, mint, black pepper and licorice. Long and sweet finish. High acidity. High tannins. Full body. A great vintage Ruby Port. Could easily be kept for decades. Goes well with chocolate or blue cheese."
21170,1591597,"Red and dark berries, nuts, dried fruits, plum and herbs on the nose. Rich, fruity and intense. Balanced sweetness. Firm tannins, giving it good structure. Delicate wine, which is still young."

I still incredibly young, and do need patience, 10 years in the celler is not a bad start, but shows potential to be a great treat in the future. "
21175,1591597,"Concentrated color, almost dark purple, with, spices and black fruits aroma. In the mouth it is fresh, with superb acidity and a wonderful expression of Black fruits. Tasty and long aftertaste."
21176,1591597,Excellent Port. The extra time on cask gives more structure. It is also less sweet. Great taste at The Yeatman in Porto. 
21177,2095243,Happily drinkable without offending or greatly impressing
21178,2095243,"Maybe a bit of bad luck in a Portuguese restaurant: wine tasted a bit off without being faulty. Some could be attributed to bad cork, some to an unknown grape variety. Thus invoking benefit-of-doubt and giving 3*"

Quite different to other Old World countries but absolutely unique.  Aromatic nose (viognier style) of flowers, pear, banana and passion fruit, soft and round fruity mouth, fresh and soft bitter. Good finish. Like it!"
21183,2095243,"4.1 pale straw, subtle floral and tropical nose, light to medium bodied with a hint of sweetness  on the palate.  Medium alcohol and medium acidity. Pretty harmonious and approachable without being notable in any way"

Nose: very aromatic ripe exotic fruit, white flowers, honey nuances and some minerals notes. In the mouth: richness of ripe white fruit, pears, sweet apple, mango, passion fruit, pineapple, white peach, some bitter-sweet herbs, mild spices accents. Fresh wine, full of fruit and spices, balanced, juicy, creamy and full body, with light bitter aftertaste."
21188,2095243,"Pretty good! Apéritif or with salads with chicken!  Mango, pear and elderflower on the nose. Passion fruit, apple and minerality on the palate. Medium finish. Good."
21189,2095243,"Nicely dry, good fruit and did I mention clams and Napoli pizza with fresh anchovies. Ate in the hotel because it started to rain and I had hiked all day on the north side of the island along the cliffs."

21205,9000,"Fantastic wine! Dry, complex and unending. Another great Niepoort white! I'm a devotee."
21206,9000,"This is big without high alcohol, it’s 11% but there is nothing feeble here. Rich and full, the mouthfeel is gorgeous and the lick of oak is spot on. Citrus acidity keeps the rich apricot and honey in check, as does the minerality, this wine is not flabby. Jolly good stuff, Mr H is desiring grilled sardines, I simply desire another glass."
21207,1126473,Portugal does produce some fantastic wines and this is no exception. Glides down. Fabulous social drink for reasonable money 
21208,1126473,Wow! Celebrating 300 reviews! Magnum size bottle! Excellent wine! What a wonderful choice for our big family summer party! 🙂 
21209,1126473,Just had this again and need to reassess from my last review. If well decanted and paired with venison loin and mushroom risotto...well it is a bit of heaven.  Full bodied and bursting with wild berries and good tannic character. Will get better over the years too. Saúde!
21210,1126473,"Perfect Portuguese Red, everything you want "
21211,1126473,"Black ripe fruit aroma with some mint notes. In the mouth its round, has soft tannis and has rich fruit flavor. Concentrated and persistent finish."

21217,1126473,"2018 vintage. A blend of aragonez, alicante bouschet, touriga nacional and syrah. Nicely integrated oak and really refined tannins. A very good Alentejo! "
21218,1126473,"Delicious drink on a rainy day in Coimbra, Portugal. Im absolutely in love with red blends from Portugal, awesome qpr as well. Decant for half an hour and enjoy. Highly recommended. 4.3/5"
21219,1126473,Powerful and well balanced Alentejano blend. Medium long finish and thankfully not too much oak as so many other Alentejo blends are sadly doing. Drink between 2-5 years.
21220,1126473,"Solid Portuguese wine. Not too complex or overpowering, medium, crisp, with green apple and young pear flavours. Smooth, elegant and aromatic. Summer diner choice or a starter "
21221,1126473,"Enjoyed this Portuguese 🇵🇹 red blend 🍷 from Alentejano with the pasta 🍝 I made today. 🤗 It’s a mix of Aragonez 🍇, Alicante Bouschet, Touriga Nacional and Syrah. Aged for 9 months in French oak barrels. Dark garnet in the glass. Aromas of vanilla, blackberry, cherry and leather. Taste is full-bodied, fruity and bold with additional notes of pepper and smoke. Dry, 13.5%, medium acidity and medium tannins. Paired quite nicely with the pasta Bolognese. 🤗😋"
21222,1184921,"Love this stuff. A really nice smooth but deep red wine. Easy tannins don't mean a lack of structure. Red fruits, gentle oak, vanilla and cherry blend seamlessly. Left the wife with it for 30mins and half the bottle disappeared!! Will be stocking up."
21223,1184921,Good balance of dark fruit and oak. Some spices and herbaceous notes coming through. Still very fresh with good tannin structure 
21224,1184921,"How can I start?? Well a very good nose, warm with floral and vanilla tones.  A bold body, sweet, medium acidity and floral and chocolate tones.  "
21225,1184921,Elegant mid bodied Portuguese blend with fresh aroma of ripe red fruit black fruit and chocolate with wood tones and persistent finishing. 
21226,1184921,"Wonderful Douro red, and a great value. Dark fruit like plum on the front with a hint of vanilla on the finish. The wine is dry, but well balanced and a great accompaniment to meat or pasta dishes."
21227,1184921,"Underperforming wine for the price. Not that the price is something out of this world, it is just this is a rather plain wine. "
21228,1184921,"Definitely a big 4 stars for me.  Very vibrant violet in colour, which draws my attention immediatley.  Medium-full bodied, some chocolate, mocha and almond nut in taste. Sweet ending of fig and smooth silky finishing.  Impressive wine from Portugal. Need 1/2 hr to 1hr to breathe for best experience."
21229,1184921,"A couple of years ago I spend a nice weekend at Quinta da Pacheca in the heart of Douro region, Portugal. It was one of the good wines I had during my stay. Specifically I had this one paring a outstanding “Duck Risotto”, typical portuguese dish. I really recommend this one and another called “Douro Grande Reserva Touriga”. Cheers ! "
21230,1184921,A bold red with cherry and lot of cassis as the top note. Oak is slightly present with spices note. Open and decant for half an hour and it’s ready to drink. Balance on tannis and acidity. Well structured with medium finish. Good QBR
21231,1184921,"Great black fruit on the nose.  Black berry and currants on the palate with hints of herb and black olives. Silky smooth rich finish, delish!"
21232,1184921,First time trying a Portugal wine. This bottle is not bad.  Medium to full bodied.  Balanced.  Nice deep and dark colour. Firm and sustained finishing. Insufficient complexity though. Closer to Spanish wine style.   4.1 is overrated  (on Vivino) in my opinion.  More a 3.8 overall. 
21233,1184921,"Red rubi, medium body, round tannins, leather, cinnamon, oak and cocoa, dark fruit. Very elegant. "
21234,1184921,"Deep ruby colour, great smell and excellent taste (hints of plum and cherry) "
21235,1184921,It's a full red wine. Needs to air about 1.5 hours. Good and cheap.
21236,1184921,"Cherry easy drinking, "
21237,33324,"Massive, concentrated and powerful, this offers lush, heady flavors of dark plum, blackberry and cherry tart, with touches of anise. Shows plenty of grip as well, with a long, rich finish of dark chocolate, toffee and cream. Very young. Best from 2040 ?? "
21238,33324,"The potential is there. Obviously far too young, but still the deep dark, sticky fruits show through. Spicy alcohol heat, drying finish."
21239,33324,"This is far too young to really appreciate properly but it can be drunk now. Although the nose is quite dumb, the fruit acid and tannins are pretty well integrated with a nice dollop of spice. It would just be a bit of a waste to drink now rather than in 10 or 15 years."
21240,33324,"Deep ruby color, intense, expressive and elegant notes of ripe black fruit like blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and lovely aromas of eucalyptus and menthol mixed with tobacco leaves, dried herbs, fig, prunes, vanilla and cigar box. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. "
21241,33324,Excellent flavors of red stewed fruit and still quite tannic. A baby wine that can develop a lot more in bottle.
21242,33324,"Nice nose of white pepper and blackberries with a touch of cassis. Bit heavy with out the classic lift of mint. On the palate it is very sweet with soft tannins. A slight hint of bitterness but severely lacking in acidity. Again it is just a bit too heavy and clumsy. It is not bad, but I expected more. Compared to the 2015 this is a sorry effort. 89-91p"
21243,33324,"Silky plums, very nice."
21244,33324,Strong fruit flavors 
21245,33324,Excellent straight or mixed in cocktails. Perfect with vanilla ice cream too
21246,33324,"What a find! Instant hit to the nose: Caramel, dried apricots, white chocolate.... An exquisite oiliness with sublime, persistent length"
21247,33324,"This is drinking well in 2017, but still a lot of alcohol heat. I'd like to see 5 more years on this and it should be seductively rich. Already deep fruit and chocolate."
21248,33324,"Founded in 1822 and still managed by successive generations of the Guimaraens family. This is something special and should be set down for many years. I opened this bottle early to celebrate my Mom’s 86th birthday, which was a very special occasion. Dark purple with complex aromas of berry & currants with notes of dry herbs. On the palate lots of rich dark berry flavors, with cedar, pepper and mineral at the core. Dense tannins, lingering ending with a statement. Very nice!"
21249,33324,"Good price, good value, getting better with years passing, a very pleasing port with spicy character but good get more depth "
21250,33324,Yum.  Caramel and nuttiness that just grabs your attention and captivates you through the long finish.  Great after a long day of travel.  Woof!
21251,33324,Nice bottle swap by the folks at Yiannis Wine Shop. Deep opaque ruby. Nose is very floral violet ? over black fruit and fig. Wait a bit longer and the wood cask will come. Light on the tongue good acidity to balance the sweetness. Tight fig and prune with tar and licorice. Nice apertif
21252,2685785,"The scarf on her black hair matches her bright red dress. White blouse contrast. Light, medium ruby red. Aromas of strawberries and menthol are interspersed with floral notes. The acidity is the backbone of the wine with berry fruit and low tannins.  Blend of indigenous Portuguese varietals from the Dão region: particularly 🈂️(J)aèn, to finish off 🔠 Saturday. "
21253,2685785,Earthy pepper dark fruit- beautiful finish - really recommended 
21254,2685785,"3.4 A warm nose of cherry and earthy notes, a fairly straightforward body, a touch of  oak, some leather, rather thin and juicy"
21255,2685785,"Ruby turning tawny, medium depth. Cherry on the nose. Feels light, high acidity, sweet tannins, red and dark ripe jammy fruit. A little spice, pepper, mint. Definitely needs food (rabbit stew?)."
21256,2685785,Good Douro producer-this bottle not too much emotions- forest fruits; earthy notes; medium to even light bodied; correct - lack of character 
21257,2685785,"Niepoort’s Dão version of light, food friendly daily wine. Typically for Dão region bland of many different variants. Aged in cement tanks. Delicate with forest fruits and some mineral notes, fresh fruity acidity, light and easy going. 3.7"
21258,2685785,"Portuguese cork. Very nice and modern label art, simple but very visual and appealing. Dark cherry-red color, compressed to medium trim, medium boiled, slow legs. Dominant dark fruit on the nose - especially black currant and blackberries, round, some hints of wood, rubber. Decent palate, medium plus tannins, some bitterness on the central mouth - making less easy to drink and enjoy, warm coal. Drank on an airplane."
21259,2685785,"Lukter av mørke bær, men er også såvidt nedom noen røde også. Samme på smak, med bjørnebær og moreller som de dominerende. En del pepper i utgangen. Småtørr med god balanse. Intens med halvlang finish. Dark fruit cherry blackberry"
21260,2685785,"Bright ruby red colour. Cherry and blackberry on nose. Red cherry, black cherry, blackcurrant and smoke on palate. Medium body. Medium to high acidity. Medium to low tannins. Medium length of the finish. "
21261,2685785,"Perfect for a casual dinner. Rich in fresh berries, vibrant acidity and soft body. Niepoort isn't disappointing "
21262,2685785,Good quality for the price!
21263,2685785,"Like licking a beekeeper’s wallet, best left open for a while "
21264,2685785,"Earthy, medium intensity, mwahh "
21265,2685785,A nice soft portugese red. Medium bodied with a nice flavour. Smooth but dry.
21266,2685785,"Light fruity black fruit. Pleasant acidity, medium tannins. Spices. No wood. Easy drinking. "
21267,1138731,"Super white wine from Portugal. New for me, but a great surprise. Full taste, wood, citrus, vanilla  butter. Long finish with acid and a little bitterness. "
21268,1138731,"Loved the 2019 vintage of this classic. Lots of personality on the nose, with ripe tangerine, pear and melon aromas complemented by deep buttery and almost caramel notes. On the palate, bold and creamy, very seductive profile with the interplay of deep fruit and oak aging flavors. Wonderful oaked white."
21269,1138731,"👀Deep gold colour. Thick heavy tears. 👃Clean nose. Medium+ intensity. Nose displays pear, peach, white flower (chamomile, honeysuckle), vanilla, cheese, banana. Slight minerals and honeycomb. Developing. 👄Dry, moderate acidity, high alcohol, full body, medium intensity. Oily palate, with pepper, apple, grapefruit notes.

21271,1138731,"(4.3) Super value premium Alantejo Reserva blend (don't know the grape varieties), oak aged 6 months. Dense and full bodied, needs breathing for whiffing off 14.5% alcohol.  First sip hits you with power and minerals, followed by gentle fruit, more saline notes and flavours of ripen citrus, grapefruit and apple. Persistent wine, dense throughout with great acidic structure.  Extra 1/2 star for value!"

21273,1138731,"Wine exchange with @Koert Neger #3.  Portuguese white from quality estate Esporao. Clearly wood use here that adds some vanilla and cigar box tones to the floral impressions. Some iodine too.  Med+ acidity. Focused, medium bodied, calling for attention. Balanced yet spicy. This soo much needs food! A spicy salad or light white fish dish would be perfect. Very good. 15 pts."
21274,1138731,"What a wine!!  Nose: Waxy lemon, oak, butter, bread dough, green apple, sea breeze, vanilla bean, chalky minerals, floral notes (peach/lemon blossom) appear as the wine breathes.  Palate is much weightier than the nose leads to believe (feels extremely fresh on the nose). Oak, butter and bread dough mingle with spiced citrus fruits (lemon and mandarin) with a lot of spice present. Sensational...  Med acid and Full body. Astonishing value, highlighting the potential of unfortified Portuguese wines!🇵🇹"
21275,1138731,"Great wine, surprise to me. Full bodied, some oak, peach and citrus as well. Very nice with my pasta! "
21276,1138731,"Big rich syrupy mouth feel, and quenching at the same time. I can’t remember details… Just that I liked it a lot."

21278,1138731,"Nice white, a bit alcoholic, good flavour."
21279,1138731,"Keeping up with this Alentejo blend aged for 6 months in barrels, which is a bit noticeable. More structure and body still with citrus notes. "

21281,1138731,"I adore this Portuguese oaky white from Alentejo: opulent, elegant, buttery aromas, long finish. One of the best RQP you can find out there!  "
21282,2050841,This is a great value red wine - you can definitely taste the local varietals that are rounded out by the syrah and cab sauv. Good weekday wine
21283,2050841,"Nice, but not perfect. Decent balance, some sweetness, some bitterness. Black rowan, some other black berries and may be tobacco at mouth."
21284,2050841,"Somewhere between 3.5 and 4. Dark fruity, vanilla, blueberry, clean, mid plus acidity mid plus body and ripe tannin. Lighter than its Douro's peer."
21285,2050841,"MST 14#5: Veel alcohol in de neus. Kers, braam, zwarte pruim, eiken, vanille, laurier, drop, zwarte peper. mooi in balans, afdronk oke. PQ is top. (3,75*)"
21286,2050841,"Red berries, pepper and hardly distinguishable hint of thyme, balanced tannins. Goes well with grilled horse steak, as a good counterpart for the sweetness of the meat."
21287,2050841,"Ruby colour, with aromas of  red fruit. Smooth blend of cabernet souvignon, shirah and Touriga national. Great with cheese and mediteranian cuisine and popcorn 🍿🍷"

21291,2050841,"2019 vintage. A blend of alicante bouschet, touriga nacional, syrah and cabernet sauvignon. A very pleasant Alentejo wine with nicely integrated oak and red fruit and vanilla on the palate. Fine grained tannins. 3.75 ⭐"
21292,2050841,"Not very usual aroma for me. From one side, it's too acidic with slight sour notes. From the other - it has some velvet notes of cherry, vanilla and red fruit.  Round body with some sense of oily wine. Bitterness of grapefruit zest and oak. Yet, there's a trace of acidity, of course.  Good strong tannins. "
21293,2050841,"Keep coming back to this winery and their splendid array of wines. Three things to note: I first visited the winery because of my work in Sustainability as they have a renowned commitment not just in the growing but in all aspects of the business. So if you are interested in our planet, it’s a positive ethos. Secondly the region is fantastically hot and commensurate benefits accrue in the grapes with so much sunshine. Finally, everything you buy with this label is exceptionally well crafted. Obrigado! "
21294,2050841,"Also vintage 2019 Is exactly as the winemaker promises: color is deep ruby. Aroma is ripe red and black berries, spicy and balmy. The palate is well balanced, round, rich in fruity and spicy notes. Nice structure of soft tannins. The 6 months of aging in oak barrels is giving soft wood in the aftertaste. This wine has its own character."
21295,2050841,"pair with rump steak easy drinking and fruity just a bit of jammyness, it's not subtle but it's good oak vanilla red fruit blackberry violet and spices  this is quite spicy wine a but tangy on the tounge i like it meduim+ body good tannins good acidity and long finish this is so good to the price!

21301,1766011,"What a power! Intense dark red/purplish colored. In the nose dark fruits like brambles and black sweet cherries, vanilla and caramel.   On the palate med+ acidity and green tannins, revealing its youth. Round flavored in line with the nose, a wee bit spicy. Med+ finish. 15 pts @ Art of Wines.  The wine needs a bit of air to open up, but you'd better allow it a 1-2 years to develop more."
21302,1766011,"[PT in coms] Dense grenade in the glass.  On the nose... my word. Very ripe red fruit, fig, fireplace, spice, tobacco leaves, violet. Wonderful, powerful aromas.  On the palate it has excellent concentration of delicious ripe red fruit, cherry, in contrast to some bitterness from tobacco leaves, herbal notes / gorse, bell pepper. Chocolate in the background. Nuts. Liqueur.  Full-bodied, great acidity, robust but well integrated tannins. Fresh.  Beautiful wine and great partner in crime attacking “bacalhau"""
21303,1766011,"This wine is a positive surprise! Even it is still young it has body and the flavours cherry, berries and pepper are in harmony with the tannins. Great value for the price!!"

21305,1766011,"Red dark color. Complex aroma of red fruits with earthy and balsamic notes. In the mouth has remarkable freshness, excellent structure and balance. Long and complex finish.  Very elegant wine, accompanied very well a ""Serra"" cheese, on Christmas Eve. "

21307,1766011,"Second wine of herdade de sao miguel we had and just like the first rosé this one was a very decent and good value wine! The nose was great and full just as the palate of the wine. In taste we got a lot of ripe red fruits (red cherries), some spices, earth, wood, pepper. All nicely blended together in a balanced full bodied wine with fine aftertaste! Good bottle Rate 4,0⭐️"
21308,1766011,"Alentejo tasting with my wineclub and this was definitively the star of the evening. Nice power and structure. Deep palate and nicely in balance. Aromas of red berries, creme de cassis, dutch maggi and walnutt. In the mouth full red berries, licorice, spicy and vegetal tones, drying minerality and a long warm filiming finish. Nice to taste a wine 100% from this special grape!!"
21309,1766011,"Almost the ideal everyday red wine, that serves more special occasions as well. And that from a former workhorse grape.  (4.2) Raspberry fruit nose with hints of vanilla, toast and slate. Medium plus acidity, full bodied, slight creaminess but slender all together, great red berry fruit, mild spiciness, medium tanines, drying and peppery finish with a slight salinity."
21310,1766011,"Wow - such an interesting red. Full-bodied, bursting with bright florals like violets and backed home with blueberry, blackberry and very mild anise. Super food friendly and not overly heavy or jammy so could go with pork tenderloin, steak, or chicken Marsala, mushroom dishes. "
21311,1766011,"(4,2) Hugely surprising. Very powerful, thick and lush. Fantastic price-quality ratio. Inky colour (the grapes not only have a blue skin, but very coloured flesh too). Smell of brambles, plums, vanilla, toffee, flowers. Flavours of ashes, plums, tobacco, brambles, blackcurrant, leather. A lot of tannins. Tickling alcohol. Thick and full-bodied. Medium(+) finish. @La Bordelaise, Brand, Noordman tasting, Oegstgeest"

21313,1212859,Dryish for port. Liked reserva better
21314,1212859,Got it from vineyard in Portugal 
21315,1212859,"93/100 This was not a declared vintage in Port but maybe it should have been, the 2015's we tasted were wonderful. We sampled this during the tasting of the 2016 vintage declaration celebration. This surprisingly smells like a dry wine. Red fruits and Mediterranean herb notes. Long finish and big, round tannins. "
21316,1212859,"Root beer, and amarone nose. Palette of cinnamon,vanilla and flat cola. Really enjoyable. Finish of wild blueberries. "
21317,1212859,"Portuguese wine tasting: Last wine and of course it is a Vintage Port from 2009. Complex aromas of violets, oak, dried cherries and crushed blackberries with a nice earthy touch. Also on the palate it is super-complex and balanced with lots of concentration and energy. Lots of freshness (acidity) perfectly combined with young/firm tannins and interesting hints of leather and cocoa. Looong and herbal finish with a juicy and fruity aftertaste. Simply Georgeous! This is bottled potential (min. 25 years)!"
21318,1212859,"Almost black colour. In the nose massive aromas of black berries, spices and a whole load of slate minerality. On the palate there is this unbelievable concentration, tannins and acidity, both is still very young, 20 years drank too early, but with an Never ending finish. Enourmous potential!"
21319,1212859,"Really intense nose of cherries, blackberries, black currant, cherry liqueur, orange peel and a peppery finish with a touch of mint. Quite sweet but packing a lot of acidity and a good deal of tannins too. A bit clumsy now it will certainly improve over the next 10-20 years as it integrates better. 95p"
21320,1212859,"Nice Port, 2012 it's a bit more woody than the other Douro darks."
21321,1212859,🇵🇹 4.0  Port with Almost “sweet red wine” Taste.  raisin cherry cocoa cassis

21324,1212859,Terrifically balanced. Beautiful 
21325,1212859,"Still purple in the glass. Very fruity. Rich, sweet, fruity taste. Earthy, leather, tobacco / cigar box, floral. Very complex. Pretty tannic still and reasonably acidic. Looks like this one could sit in the cellar for decades."
21326,1212859,"🏅4.1⭐️ First impression: mighty amount of tobacco; then aromas of oak, some Amarena cherry, spice and a hint of violets. Spicy and complex on the palate; long finish and fruity aftertaste."
21327,2412043,"Touriga Nacional rich in dark fruit, oak, cedar, spice and plum. Good quality wine, without complexity and low price. It went well with rosmarinos”s foccacia. Long, fruity and smooth finish. Pleasant Portuguese grape . 4,0"
21328,2412043,"Portugal degustation #5. Definitely a pattern emerging here — good quality wines at a great price. This one is rich in dark fruit matched by cedar, spice, and aromatic resin. Quite balanced with smooth tannins."

21337,2412043,"Our ➕hursday's Alphabe➕ game - ➕he le➕ ➕er ➕ for T. A solid ➕ejo wine made of ➕ouriga National at reasonable price, thus good to have it around, e.g. for ➕he Alphabe➕ game😀. Purple red colour with aromas of black and red fruits with gentle nuances of spices, cacao, sweet vanilla. On the palate medium bodied with also medium acidity and smooth mild tannins. Flavours becoming now a bit more complex. Plum, forest berries with well embedded spices and again cacao. Smooth finish and medium fruity-spicy finish.➕"
21338,2412043,"(88/100)  This is a real treat, it's almost identical to a SE Australian Shiraz!   Rich, dark boozy nose of plum and vanilla, with a palate of stewed red fruit, vanilla, beautiful layers of oak, ripe & juicy tannins with wispy tones of milk chocolate to end.   Medium to full bodied, medium acidity, plush and oily in texture, decent depth of character and a wonderful intensity that shows well on the long, uber dry finish.   Simply sublime for €6."
21339,2412043,"Plum, chocolate, coffee. Lighter oak notes, lots of dark fruit. Tannins are a little grainy but it’s a rich wine. Give it some air to mellow out and open up. "
21340,2412043,"Short Portuguese cork, winery branded, “enjoy” stamped on top and bottom, soft red-violet minced top. Simple double label art, readable. Good legs, not slow nor fast, dark color, compressed trim. Decent nose, soft alcohol breath, ripe plum. Good palate, red fruit, ripe fruit, some good acidity - not so common in red wines, some soft coffee notes, easy to drink with a good character though, some deposit in the end of the bottle. Good quality price relation on this one!"
21341,2412043,Really good anf fruity wine with the  taste of plum and chocolate. Super dark colour with light and smooth finish. It goes really good with food  but also by itself because it's not  super heavy.
21342,2271714,"Raspberry, cherry and clove were my first tastes. The wine is dry and bold. Surprising from Douro as never seen a Pinot from there until this and love their wines. Enjoyable and will partake again. "
21343,2271714,"Light ruby color. Smooth red fruits aroma with wood and and spices notes. In the mouth it shows freshness and elegance, with silky tannins and medium body. Tasty and medium aftertaste."
21344,2271714,"Rasberry,  cherry, earthy notes. Dry. Light bodied. Well balance. Cool Pinot. Great wine"
21345,2271714,"Great Pinot, raspberry, some pepper and good spices. Licorice and red fruit. "
21346,2271714,"[Aneto Wine Bar 2/2] Very interesting because it seems I had this a year ago but I completely forgot. At the time I recognized the quality but I remained reserved due to the clear PN character. Now I appreciated it much more... Is it the circumstances or proof that I learned to appreciate PN and therefore became an adult wine drinker (as I was told by a winemaker in Burgundy 🧐)... Anyway, liked it from the earthy nose with red berry and red cherry, raspberry, unripe prune and mint to the... ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️"
21347,2271714,"4,4⭐My first Pinot Noir and I have to say I got a really good first impression.  👃On the nose it opens with oak and raspberry notes. 👅Same notes are predominant on the mouth along with some cherry, pepper and dried blackberry. Light body, smooth and round mouth. 🏁 Long and pleasant finish. 🗒️Matched an octopus dish perfectly, and so enjoyable that could easily take an entire bottle during dinner. :)"
21348,2271714,"Not your typical Douro grape, not your typical Douro wine. It seems that wines are still made from grapes.  In this case, not in a good way. The wine falls flat, not having Douro more charming characteristics.  Flavour wise is strangely reminiscent of a low body rioja.  Interesting experience, but not to be repeated. "
21349,2271714,"Slightly smoky dried raspberry on the José. Well balanced. Dried herbs, dried red fruits. Simple and pleasant. "
21350,2271714,Light bodied Pinot. Great value at 30 euro in a Portuguese restaurant. Could drink an entire case of it. 
21351,2271714,"Light, not bitter"
21352,2271714,Very light wine red fruit 
21353,2271714,"First PN from Portugal. Enjoyed it, would not compare to French PN but still good and not so expensive."
21354,2271714,Earthy with body
21355,2271714,"Interesting Pinot from the Douro, light body, red berries and strawberry on the nose with a great acidity on the palate, balanced and estructured"
21356,2271714,"That was a surprise. Pinot Noir from Douro in Portugal with a nice red-fruity ruby colour. On the nose rather moderate notes of red fruits with subtle but clear vegetables nuances and fine traces of spices like delicious vanilla. On the palate with great rich fruity body. Flavours of cherries, currants and berries with spicy and earthy undertones, delicate barrel, good and very well balanced acidity and ripe round tannins. Quite long finish and savoury fruity refreshing aftertaste. Very lush PN from Douro."
21357,5608859,Repeating this nice wine from Esporão that does not have any stage in oak. It was chosen to pair with Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá (Portuguese dish made with Codfish). Wonderful!

21372,8974,"93+/100 A field blend including grapes like Tinta Amarela, Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Tinto Cão, and Tinta Roriz. It’s aged in old oak for 22 months. Even though it’s a young there are notes of leather along with sweet red cherry, blueberry, and some mineral tones. Excellent fruit concentration for a wine that is only 12.5% abv. It’s almost like a dense Pinot Noir. The palate is sensual with many layers and fine-grained tannins. Brilliant stuff."

21388,1165304,Quinta do Noval Vintage Port 2018.   WS NYC
21389,1165304,Ohhh yes. Young vintage from Quinta Noval. Doesn’t come much better than this. 👍👍💪🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷
21390,1165304,"Top Port, Vanille, Buttrig, Reife Himbeere "
21391,1165304,"Very sweet, very thick, smells fig and dried fruits and tastes syrup. Personally I don’t like the level of sweetness of Port wine. But the thickness is pretty attractive. "
21392,1165304,"Full of black berries, cherries 🍒 with light aromatic herbal background, spicy - friendly and vibrant texture with nice tannins - it will keep aging beautifully "
21393,1165304,"At Lasarett, Torshov.  No detailed notes. Not quite up there with Niepoort 2017, but definitely a great package already!  94p"
21394,1165304,"This is a crowd pleaser. Very smooth with licorice, milk chocolate, and cherry notes. A bit of grassiness adds depth, but I don't think it needs it."
21395,1165304,"There’s a lot of excitement about this port, and it’s easy to see why.  The nose is lovely and fresh, violets and vibrant black fruit.  A lot of weight on the palate, dense and spiced, while retaining a clear sense of purity and lift.  Excellent balance of sweetness, tannin and acidity.  A great prospect. "
21396,1165304,"There is potential here! Still young, but already great! The tannins are still a bit rough but will well develop with time. Not too much sweetness and good acidity. Great finish that will become a 5/5 in few years in my opinion! Cheers 🍷"
21397,1165304,"Really delicious. Well balanced fruity character(plum, blackberry, cherry), long lasting finish with licorice, chocolate, deep oak, leather flavor. Better than silval 1996 vintage."
21398,1165304,"Herbal, some stem/green notes, red fruit like red currants and raspberries, black currants and blackberries, high acidity and has excellent structure. Austere at the moment but will be very long lived."
21399,1165304,"Wait! This wine will be brilliant, but only if we wait...opening bottles of this now can be equated with nothing less than oenological infanticide. Wait!"
21400,1165304,"Incredible power, fragrant, ripe black fruit, sweet, dense. Actually quite enjoyable even so young."
21401,1165304,"Consistent with previous editions, it’s a great vintage Port, an extraordinary eine"
21402,3343453,"Crystalline citrine color. Tropical fruits aroma. In the mouth is citric, tasty and very balanced. A long and pleasant aftertaste.  Very gastronomic profile."
21403,3343453,"(4,0) Nice blend where a lot is happening. Honey, acacia, salt, lemon, apple, pear, melon, pineapple, some mango, apricots, a little smoke, bit of cream. Good acidity. Very sutbtle use of oak."

21408,3343453,So never really like vinho verde but this is something else. Nice round mouthfeel but then a bold yet not to harsh acidity. Doesnt get dull...
21409,3343453,"Bigger than your typical Vinho Verde. Lemon zest, tangerines, white flowers, a faint hint of yeast, and saline. Medium-bodied, round and very refreshing. Medium+ citrussy finish. Score 3.7."
21410,3343453,"Light in colour. 👃 is refreshing, peach, sea, cold, little disappointing. Mouth is good, not too long, minerals, cold sea stones, citrus and 🍑 peach. Little above average Vinho Verde."
21411,3343453,"Quite typical, well presented Vinho Verde, definitely not the type that gave the style a simplistic reputation in the past but also not quite up there with the really good ones.  Fresh nose with anise, lemon, wet stone and green apple followed by a slightly flat palate with crisp & tart acidity and mainly more lemon. 3.4"
21412,3343453,"Produced mainly with grapes from old vines in conversion to organic farming . Citric color with a crystalline hue. Flavors of mandarin peel, lemon blossoms,dried herbs are interwoven  with a vegetal and slightly smoky twist . Fresh, complex and rich on the palate with a pleasant and prolonged finish."
21413,3343453,"Herbaceous, tea leaf, dried grass, chamomile, citrus peel. Tasty, strong. Different, no fruity, herbaceous finish"
21414,3343453,"Green apple, some pear, citrus base with nice minerals. Fresh, crisp with ripe citrus tones. Saline finish. 3.75/5"
21415,3343453,"Very Nice vino verde with nice complexity, fresh but complete full taste of this singular, made from a diversity of old vines, which gives it full Tate and structure. Ideal for al fresco and sea food, top acidity to balance in a perfect way. Deserves a much higher ranking, but then not so many people have learned this newest development in vino verde. For me one of the best"
21416,3343453,"Fruity, citrus and honey. "
